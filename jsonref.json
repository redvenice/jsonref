And as you say, some of those fears may linger even after vaccination.”Despite his note of caution, Broadbent said he anticipated a strong recovery in consumer spending this summer as Covid restrictions were eased, helping the UK recover economically from the pandemic.Highlighting a boom in activity after the relaxation of lockdown last summer, he said: “Overall spending does come back pretty strongly when you remove these caps, at least initially. So we have certainly allowed for some lingering concerns. But that doesn’t mean that consumption overall won’t recover quite strongly, at least initially, once you start loosening the restrictions. That was exactly the experience we had last year.”Hospitality, leisure and international travel, where social interaction is important, have suffered most in the pandemic. However, Broadbent said consumers had reallocated spending to areas where the risks of infection were lower, helping to offset the damage to the economy at large. Online sales, as well as spending on DIY, home furnishings, bicycles and hobbies have surged during the past year.Broadbent said tight border restrictions imposed by the government could drag down economic activity in the coming weeks. Ministers are preparing to quarantine arrivals to the UK from high-risk countries in hotels from 15 February, because of concerns about mutant strains of Covid-19.The Bank has not forecast the implications of specific border controls, but Broadbent said: “My instinct would be that if you close borders, that would be negative for both the demand and the supply side of the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758ecb5c87cd8a870a880acde093b38993306154/159_104_2557_1535/master/2557.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=16d26ff01c58cfe82ded3e0d99b27b78","title":"seed sized chameleon madagascar world tiniest reptile","story":"Male nano-chameleon, named Brookesia nana, has body only 13.5mm longScientists say they have discovered a sunflower-seed-sized subspecies of chameleon that may well be the smallest reptile on Earth.Two of the miniature lizards, one male and one female, were discovered by a German-Madagascan expedition team in northern Madagascar.The male Brookesia nana, or nano-chameleon, has a body that is only 13.5mm (0.53 inches) long, making it the smallest of all the roughly 11,500 known species of reptiles, the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich said. Its total length from nose to tail is just under 22mm (0.87 inch).The female nano-chameleon is significantly larger, with an overall length of 29mm, the research institute said, adding that the scientists were unable to find further specimens of the new subspecies “despite great effort”.The species’ closest relative is the slightly larger Brookesia micra, whose discovery was announced in 2012.Scientists assume that the lizard’s habitat is small, as is the case for similar subspecies.“The nano-chameleon’s habitat has unfortunately been subject to deforestation, but the area was placed under protection recently, so the species will survive,” Oliver Hawlitschek, a scientist at the Center of Natural History in Hamburg, said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9637f37be9a548f052e3aa49ba96eb6a3f574f2c/0_1698_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c9b2af09acd369db0d0e6b4ef80183","title":"remember wearing proper trousers let me jog your memory","story":"Not all trousers come with a matching sweatshirt. At some point you will want to dig out a smart pair againLife skills I suspect I may have lost through what is heading towards a year of neglect include, but are not limited to: small talk for parties, lifts and chatty Uber drivers how to survive a work day without uninterrupted access to a fridge where anything is that is farther than the other side of the local park. Also, how to wear proper trousers. As in, the kind that don’t come with a matching sweatshirt. Remember them?There is no urgency to relearning any of this, more’s the pity. But I can feel the gap between the old and the new me widen with every lockdown day. So rather than leave the full gamut of life-skills revision to the last minute, now seems a good time to get a jump on a few basics. Such as: how to do trousers that have fastenings and require you to choose a top. Smart trousers – the kind you wear to go to work rather than just work in, or to eat in a restaurant rather than pad about the kitchen – have been my wardrobe’s most neglected department since the pandemic began. When your public-facing persona is visible only from the waist up, top-loading your outfit is common sense. Out of sight, out of mind and all that.The challenge of getting back into proper trousers (and this is assuming the waistband does up, which isn’t a given at this point) is that there is no matching top half to reach for. And unlike jeans, they don’t always work with a hoodie, so it is up to you to figure out what to wear on top. Shirt or sweater? Tucked in or left loose?Stay within your comfort zone by replicating the proportions you’ve been wearing in lockdown. If you’ve been living in a tracksuit, a boxy jumper like the ancient favourite navy one I’m wearing here, with flat-front trousers, feels reassuringly familiar. If you’ve been in leggings and a big T-shirt, then team an overshirt with stretch trousers.I am hoping that relearning how to wear trousers will jog my memory of how to be a fully functioning adult human, just as method actors wear cowboy boots or crocodile loafers to get into character. When I put on trousers, I feel like the me who had a go-to coffee shop order, rather than an obsessive attachment to a certain tea mug. One day the world will restart. And I intend to be dressed and ready to go. • Jess wears trousers, £240, harriswharflondon. Heels, £150, reiss. Jumper, her own. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson, assisted by Peter Bevan.

But following a trading frenzy the stock began to fall, almost as quickly as it had risenAt the beginning of the year, not many people were paying attention to GameStop. Its business of selling video games in retail stores looked increasingly shaky as the market shifted ever more online in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic. GameStop’s seemingly grim prospects led Wall Street hedge funds to take out big bets on the company’s share price falling further (known as short selling) but they had not reckoned with a force that was about to blow them away. Users of the Reddit messageboard WallStreetBets began grouping together to buy huge quantities of GameStop’s stock, driving the share price higher and higher and inflicting huge losses on the hedge fund titans.  Desmund Delaney tells Rachel Humphreys that as part of the Reddit community he was tipping shares in GameStop back in 2019 and took his own advice investing in the company, despite the derision of other users. But he gave up on the company last year while its share price was below $10 and cashed out. If he’d sold last week he would be sitting on half a million dollars.  Economist Dan Davies explains that while the phenomenon of an online community-driven stock market bubble feels new and exciting, it’s a story as old as the markets themselves. A group of investors egg each other on to speculatively jack up the price of shares they are holding – only for the whole thing to come crashing down. In the case of GameStop, it may have burned some incautious hedge fund managers, but the steep decline in the share price this week has proved to be a sharp lesson for amateur investors who didn’t sell up before the crash began. Are online forums a new force on Wall Street? Or are the odds still stacked too steeply against them?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53fd69948aed9df4c103f847e9b7c059213400b/0_87_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6908e6659d32a5aeaf32ce05b8b6e4ba","title":"pandemic burnout rise uk latest covid lockdowns take toll","story":"Increasing number of people report feeling worn out and unable to cope due to period of sustained stressPsychologists are reporting a rise in “pandemic burnout” as many people find the current phase of lockdowns harder, with an increasing number feeling worn out and unable to cope.They warn that many are finding the latest lockdown more difficult because of a realisation that coronavirus will be around longer than expected, dashed hopes about an easing of restrictions, and a period of sustained stress similar to overwork, which has prompted symptoms such as fatigue.Emma Kavanagh, a psychologist and author, said she had noticed more people reaching out over social media. “We are tired and have been doing this for a long time and we had this initial array of coping capacity and it’s simply burnt out. When you look at burnout by definition you’re talking about being too stressed for too long. There is this experience where your brain reaches capacity and goes: ‘I cannot give the same mental attention to this any more.”Kavanagh has been researching extreme environments in psychology, and said: “So what you find in these extreme environments, which is a nice analogy for where we are now in terms of unpredictability and uncontrollability … is that they find something called psychological hibernation which is the same as burnout.“You see things like your concentration getting sluggish, you find it harder to pay attention and you have sleep and memory issues.”But Kavanagh said people could come out of the current situation stronger. “People who have survived disasters have no control over it but most will exhibit post-traumatic growth, a small minority will experience long-term health effects. The vast majority will return to a baseline of function or exhibit growth.”Steven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia, said at the start people had little to no knowledge of what a pandemic was and then as restrictions eased there was a sense that it was almost over.“Then the second wave occurred and people in many countries were back in lockdown. In technical terms, people were in a situation of ‘frustrative non-reward’. They thought they would be rewarded with an end to the pandemic, but that reward was taken away from them. Understandably, people were frustrated,” he said.“More generally, the stressfulness of a pandemic is related to how long it lasts. People are exposed to chronic stressors as pandemics drag out over many months and multiple lockdowns. That wears people down.”He said pandemic-related burnout was something people might experience where they feel “increasingly emotionally exhausted, despairing and irritable as the pandemic drags out”. He compared this to what the World Health Organization has called “pandemic fatigue”.“Pandemic-related lockdowns and other restrictions disrupt our routines so that we no longer have fixed schedules or landmarks during our day … It can get to a point where every day is exactly the same. If there are no landmarks and little in the way of a fixed schedule, life becomes a blur, and people experience difficulty recalling what they did,” he said.Julia Faulconbridge, the vice-chair of the ision of clinical psychology at the British Psychological Society, said not everyone had the same experiences. She added that from a psychological point of view, the messaging that people had received had been hard to accept. “If you look back at early autumn things were getting worse but it was not so obvious for people. There was talk of what you would do for Christmas and vaccines coming.”“Then suddenly it was like all of that got swept away … suddenly the vaccine started to look more shaky as we heard about mutated strains and then, of course, we moved into this really serious crisis of health that has come since January.”She said many people would by now know someone who was ill or had died.“The whole thing becomes a lot darker in terms of what we think we are living through,” she said. “I would not use the term burnout but if you have pressures and stresses and difficulties going on in your life, those are almost certainly going to be exacerbated by being in lockdown.“Any sort of pinch point or difficulty and stresses get exacerbated, and the longer they go on the more the pressure can build up and we are often isolated now from our normal support structures. For me, it’s more than burnout, but people getting more and more trapped in difficulties … Every single person in this country is under stress to some extent or other in this pandemic.“Stress affects our bodies in ways that are described as burnout. That long-term stress is different from short-term and has an insidious and profound effect on how we can function. Even if we are functioning fairly well, we are not functioning as we used to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a437652a9f3ab01081041b8d3b77d74687d167f/1_0_3022_1814/master/3022.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=cb8c487b5dc077ab3d146cc2f9bee0b6","title":"no touchscreens more space welcome to the post pandemic office","story":"With new safety protocols prompting design changes, traditional office spaces may be a thing of the pastThe pandemic has shown us that work can go on without a workplace. If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?Elvira Muñoz Beraza, director of the master’s in strategic design of spaces at IE School of Architecture and Design, in Madrid, says that this year’s disruptions will transform offices for the better. “The pandemic has accelerated trends that were already there and has forced companies and experts to have difficult yet necessary conversations,” she says. “The office is the place for collaboration, social interaction and a sense of belonging. This implies less ‘me’ spaces and more ‘we’ spaces: the long open areas filled with inidual workstations or filled with cubicles are gone.”With inidual workstations effectively relocated to people’s kitchens and living rooms, offices are being reconfigured as places that primarily exist for teamwork and collaborative activity – albeit with strict social distancing measures in place and partitions separating different teams and departments.Architects and office planners are already busy with a raft of changes, including larger desks and layouts that make more use of stairwells to reduce the use of enclosed lifts. And, of course, there’s the ongoing drive to minimise the use of frequently touched surfaces, such as taps, door handles and buttons.Beraza is focused on how offices can evolve to meet the changing needs of a company and its employees. “I believe the design of the workplace will need to focus on a hybrid combination of physical and virtual, of inidual and collective, of internal and external actions, tasks and collaboration.”She notes the importance of supporting a hybrid form of office and remote work. “Remote working should stay, combined with physical encounters. Remote work is sustainable because it provides more choice and is more inclusive and erse. The nine-to-five office culture is gone for good.”Lewis Barker, ServiceNow’s senior manager of workplace services, EMEA, believes that, post-Covid, the distinction between “working from home” and “work” will cease to exist. “For many employees, the traditional office and desktop workspace is over. For them, work is wherever they want or need it to be, on whatever screen and digital device they prefer,” he says. “This agile, more distributed ‘anywhere, anytime’ workplace of the future will transform how companies operate.”Barker believes this flexibility will become an increasingly important factor for attracting and retaining staff. “If businesses don’t look to change, whether that’s with a hybrid model or all the way to completely remote, they will struggle to bring in the talent needed,” he says.Within the office, new technologies are being adopted to enable more rigorous safety protocols. Companies are shifting to touch-free sensor technology for handles, buttons and taps, signalling a reverse from the preponderance of pre-Covid touchscreens. Some planners are even looking at technology that will allow staff to control lifts and vending machines using their personal smartphones.“In terms of the conversations we’ve been having about safety precautions in the future,” says Barker, “it’s about trying to reduce the number of touchpoints employees have, whether that’s automatic doors, coffee machines, access card readers and things like that, to reduce any contamination generally.”Other design changes will need to take place, too. Daaf Serné, ServiceNow’s director of global real estate and workplace, suggests this will include allowing more square metres per person, as well as improving the amount of space in high traffic areas, and re-thinking how we can meet and collaborate in our offices. “One thing that will be key, is how technology will influence the physical environment. When thinking about the role that AI will play in the future workplace, it will help us predict when people are coming in and how we can optimisebetter utilise our spaces to support our employees better. When we talk about our ServiceNow products and how we would use this, reserving your seat or desk in the office will be ‘normal’,” he says.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Here’s how to navigate the dos and don’tsWorkplace etiquette was a minor minefield before the pandemic. Now, in the wake of Covid-19, navigating an ever changing “new normal” of office interactions has become a major conundrum. Can you stop for a conversation in a one-way space? Should you get a colleague a cup of coffee? What can you do to make remote workers feel like fully integrated team members?There’s no pre-written rulebook for pandemic work etiquette, so let’s look at a few tips for navigating the new manners landscape.1. Keep your distanceIt’s amazing how quickly we’ve moved from an intimate, close-quarters society to one where people hug the sides of corridors upon passing another human. But good manners here are what they’ve always been. That is, you want other people to feel comfortable and at ease, so you should assume relatively strict distancing even if you are personally quite relaxed. If this seems a pain, there are some real upsides here. No more bone-crushing handshakes and no more awkward or clumsy collisions when a colleague or contact leans in for a peck on the cheek. You just waggle your elbows stupidly at each from a metre away from each other and make a joke about how weird it all is.2. Video conferencing v face-to-faceIf you are working on a hybrid or semi-remote team, there are unwritten rules of engagement. Those who are in the office can pick up on nuance and body language in a way that those who are on a video call just can’t. So it falls upon on-site employees to speak as if everyone is on a video call, taking turns and talking clearly. Resist the urge to make asides or get into rapid fire discussions with your in-person colleagues as this excludes those who are working remotely. It’s hard for remote employees to fully participate when it sounds as if they’ve called into the middle of a rugby scrum.4. If people are breaking the rules …A good rule of thumb here is to treat everyone as if they’re innocent at first. Rather than being aggressive or sarcastic you might say: “Mike, I think you forgot we’re meant to be socially distancing here.” Chances are a reminder is all it will take. However, if the person says it’s no big deal or refuses, you might say: “It makes me uncomfortable or anxious,” or “We all have to obey the rules, even if they’re a pain.” In the first case, you’re making it about their effect on you, not their behaviour and in the second, you’re making it about rules that aren’t set by either of you. Both or are non-confrontational and hard to argue with, especially the former.5. Companies can helpLewis Baker, senior workplace services manager at ServiceNow says that it really helps if companies codify the rules and explain them to staff. “We put together a Return to Workplace playbook, which explains the new workplace experience and behaviour we expect of ServiceNow employees upon return. By the time they came back in, they knew what the guidelines were.” He adds that ServiceNow also supplies some of the basics: “We provide masks. We also offer online mindfulness sessions, you know, cooking classes, nutrition advice, and ergonomic advice. We’ll help you to get set up from home and put support mechanisms in place.” Straightforward rules help people understand what is expected and reduces the risk of disagreement and conflict. Companies should also keep staff up to date as government guidelines and scientific advice changes.It truly is a weird new world of work out there. But by staying respectful and keeping it clean, we can all make it through together – apart.The ServiceNow Safe Workplace Suite offers tools for organisations to deliver the right digital experience for each phase of reopening.

Other island nations such as Tonga, in the South Pacific Ocean, have reported no infections.“To be an island in 2020 or 2021 is probably the greatest geographical gift you could have,” said Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.So, as British cases start to fall and discussions about easing lockdown restrictions resume, are there strategies it could borrow to return it to normality?From the UK’s shores, New Zealand’s current situation looks idyllic: “After the lockdown(s), which were only required because border closure came too late, day-to-day life for most New Zealanders appears to be completely normal, and there are very few restrictions” said Matt Boyd at Adapt Research Ltd in Reefton, New Zealand, who has modelled the impacts of border closures for island nations.Even his own pre-Covid predictions about a major loss of tourism revenues if New Zealand ever closed its borders, have not entirely come to pass. Tourist operators continue to call for emergency funding, but the economic impact has been blunted by New Zealanders holidaying domestically, Boyd said: “Socially there have been family separations, people unable to return home for funerals, or see dying loved ones. But the social, economic and political consequences in New Zealand seem less than in countries dealing with ongoing community transmission.”This begs the question: would the UK now be in a similar position, had it acted earlier? The UK confirmed its first Covid-19 case on 31 January – three weeks before the virus arrived in New Zealand. “Logistically it would have meant making a decision very early on,” said Boyd.Yet speed is of the essence, and other countries managed it: “Taiwan and Hong Kong imposed the first measures as early as 31 December. South Korea, Thailand and Japan also responded quickly,” said Kelley Lee, professor of global health governance at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, whose team recently reviewed 29 studies modelling the impact of travel restrictions on Covid-19 transmission. “We found that if cross-border measures are going to work, they need to be applied early on.”The British home secretary, Priti Patel, recently said she had advocated shutting the UK’s borders in March. But although a series of travel measures were introduced in 2020 – including issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries – this was withdrawn on 13 March, with no further border measures in place until 8 June.Genetic analysis revealed that Sars-CoV-2 was inidually introduced well over a thousand times during early 2020 – mostly from Spain, France, and Italy. “Late February to mid March were critical,” said Prof Oliver Pybus at the University of Oxford, who led this research. “During this period, high numbers of incoming travellers from Europe coincided with large and growing epidemics in many European countries.”The result was multiple chains of transmission being initiated in parallel at different locations. This rapidly overwhelmed the UK’s existing capacity for inidual-level contact tracing. It also prevented the virus from being contained in a particular part of the country through a cordon sanitaire like in Wuhan, China. “It’s likely that the importations resulted in the early phase of epidemic growth accelerating faster than was expected,” said Pybus. “Importations mean the virus can reach less well-connected or more remote parts of the country more quickly.”The UK’s connectedness may also have put it at a disadvantage. “Like France and Germany, we’re kind of in that position of connecting Asia and the Americas and Africa as a pretty central point in the world, so we have a lot of people connecting through but also coming here,” said Andrew Tatem, professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton. “That is something that governments always have to balance up, because a lot of our service industries are based on that connectivity.”Even though rapid action can buy a country time, it does not completely prevent virus from being imported – as further small outbreaks in New Zealand have shown. “Governments need to use that time to put in place and fortify domestic public health measures – notably testing and quarantine,” said Lee. “It is what governments do domestically in addition to cross-border measures that has contributed to how they’ve fared over the past year.”It may not be too late. Many British scientists would like to see the UK further tighten its borders and pursue a “zero-Covid” strategy in the coming months. “People talk about living with the virus. But what is that?” said Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine.Either we try to eliminate the virus, meaning minimising travel and maintaining lockdown restrictions until there are so few cases they can be managed through contact tracing – as New Zealand has done – or ease restrictions earlier, in the hope that the vaccine will provide a solution, McKee said. It will still be many months before everyone is vaccinated, and new variants may be imported from abroad. The UK government is not convinced about the need for blanket border restrictions. It is also scrambling to book tens of thousands of hotel rooms to quarantine arrivals from 33 high-risk countries on the UK travel ban list, which are due to open on 15 February.Speaking at the Commons transport select committee on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “We are an island nation unlike … Australia or something which is an entire continent – and that means that we need to get medicines in, we need to get food in, we need to get our raw materials in, sometimes we have to move people around, scientists and others.However, it is a misnomer to use the term “border closure” to describe what other island nations have done. “Few countries, if any, have completely closed their borders during this pandemic,” said Lee. “Australia and New Zealand continue to have travellers and trade flowing into their countries. But they have reduced these to essential traffic, and they have then also introduced screening, testing and quarantine measures that ensure that anyone and anything entering their countries are virus-free.“The task, therefore, is to decide what is essential versus non-essential traffic. It is essential that food supplies, medicines and key workers, for example, continue to flow across borders. However non-essential travel should be discouraged.”The UK now faces a similar dilemma: “We have a choice here between opening up in the UK or being able to travel abroad,” said Sridhar. “Would you like to be able to socialise, have children at school, go to bars, watch live sports events, attend music events and get back to daily life, but at the expense of not being able to travel? Or would you like to go abroad and cross borders but live with tighter restrictions for the foreseeable future?.”Ask a New Zealander which they would choose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a003b9e17b529aac6dd152d02e103a8203bafa5/0_66_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b931fa9f0ddb94fb6cd12d77501c6c51","title":"no 10 distances itself cabinet office covid vaccine schedule","story":"Hancock confirms Covid jabs schedule after it was initially denied when revealed in election planMatt Hancock has confirmed a government timetable of early May for all UK adults aged 50 and older to be offered a first coronavirus vaccination, while arguing it is “still too early” to start talking about an imminent wider reopening from lockdown.The May deadline was one Downing Street had previously declined to specify, and which emerged on Friday seemingly by accident when it was mentioned as part of a government plan for elections in England that month.No 10 had previously said only that the target for offering initial vaccinations to the first nine groups of people, phase 1 of the programme, was “spring”.But a Cabinet Office document published on Friday, setting out plans to hold elections on 6 May, said these could safely happen in part because the first phase of vaccinations would be finished by then.Downing Street initially dismissed the schedule, saying the Cabinet Office report was “issued in error” and had been withdrawn, before saying it was correct after all.Hancock told Sky News: “My plan is that we should be able to offer the vaccine to everybody in categories 1 to 9 – that’s all the over-50s – by May,” adding that “lots of things have got to go right to hit that goal”, especially continued supply of vaccines.Confirmation of the timetable prompted immediate demands from some Conservative MPs for an accelerated schedule to end England’s lockdown.Mark Harper, the former chief whip who chairs the Covid Recovery Group, which groups together about 70 Tory backbenchers, said if the first vaccination phase was completed by May, it would be “almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all by that point”.“Once the top four risk groups have been vaccinated by 15 February, and protected by 8 March, the government must start easing the restrictions,” Harper said, adding that ministers should also look at fully reopening schools before March.But Hancock urged caution, pointing to the fact that more than 30,000 people were still in UK hospitals with Covid, and calling that “far, far too many”.Asked about a rapid easing of lockdown, he said: “It’s still too early to say,” adding: “I know there’s good news out there, but we still have very serious problems that we’ve got to get through.”While the expected timetable for people to be offered vaccinations is of intense interest to the public, Downing Street had been wary of committing to schedules beyond the target of offering first vaccinations to all older care home residents and staff by the end of January – which was largely met – and to have done the same for the first four most vulnerable groups, as far as those aged 70-plus and clinically extremely vulnerable people, by mid-February.One reason for caution was the sense inside No 10 that Boris Johnson has previously overpromised in terms of timetables for a return to more normal life.Another caveat is that while the current speed of vaccinations is sufficiently fast to meet the May deadline – more than 2.5m doses have been delivered in both of the last two weeks – this is dependent on a continued supply of vaccines.The ambiguity created some confusion, with Downing Street repeatedly declining over recent days to specify a deadline. The inclusion of May in the elections plan appeared to catch No 10 off guard. Johnson’s deputy spokesperson initially said of the document: “This was issued in error, and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this.”Several minutes later, he corrected himself, saying: “It isn’t actually being withdrawn.” He then conceded: “The Cabinet Office document is correct – what it says is correct – and the prime minister will set out more details on 15 February.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b81c3ca88d58b34f138767ae911a69b31bb7fec/0_229_2566_1539/master/2566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=839a879ab391bc83cdbb5fe0db5871f4","title":"oxford covid vaccine just as effective against kent variant trials suggest","story":"Scientists say it offers only slightly lower protection compared with original CovidThe Covid vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is nearly as effective against the Kent variant as it is against older forms of the virus, according to preliminary research results.Researchers analysed swabs from trial volunteers who developed asymptomatic or symptomatic infections to determine which variant of the virus they had caught after receiving the vaccine or a control jab.In a preprint under review at the Lancet, the scientists reported that levels of neutralising antibodies – those that wipe out the virus – were nine times lower in vaccinated people who caught the Kent variant, named B117, compared with those who contracted older variants.The latest results are drawn from swabs taken between 1 October 2020, about two weeks after the first known case of B117 infection was detected in Kent, and 14 January. By that time the more transmissible variant had spread rapidly from Kent, London and the east across the rest of the country.Of more concern are new variants first discovered in South Africa and Brazil, which both bear a mutation called E484K. Early studies suggest the mutation may help the virus to evade immunity induced by vaccines and past Covid infection. The E484K mutation recently appeared among B117 variants, prompting fears the virus could become harder to control.Andrew Pollard, a professor of paediatric infection and immunity, and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: “Over the last couple of months we’ve seen very similar efficacy of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine against the B117, UK, or Kent variant, very similar to the original virus that was circulating last year.”The UK has ordered 40m doses and is rolling them out nowDoses Clinical trials involved two doses 21 days apart. The UK is stretching this to 12 weeks.The UK has ordered 100m doses and has begun distributionDoses\u0026nbspTwo, four to 12 weeks apartThe UK has ordered 17m doses, to be delivered in March or April60m doses ordered by the UK, with distribution expected principally in the second half of the year30m doses ordered by the UKDoses: One, making it unique among Covid vaccines with phase 3 results so farThe data is preliminary and involves swabs from only 499 trial volunteers. Of 1,524 positive nose and throat swabs collected from the participants, 323 swabs from 256 people yielded virus that was identified by genetic sequencing.Further analysis revealed that those who received the Oxford jab but still became infected shed the virus for a shorter time and had lower viral loads than those in the control group. The findings may help to explain why the vaccine appears to reduce transmission by as much as two-thirds after the first shot.Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said the findings were positive. “By any standards this is very good news as the B117 variant with its increased transmission had the potential to derail our planned timeline for recovery.“This variant has been thought of as mainly facilitating transmission rather than evasion of immunity – the prediction from antibody neutralisation tests in the lab had been that the vaccine would still be protective. However, there’s a big gap between showing this in the lab and showing actual protection in the population. We still need to worry about the other variants with the E484K mutation, as in the South Africa variant and the new mutation in the UK. That’s the one where we really need a keen eye on how well the vaccines work,” he said.Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said the team’s platform technology allowed them to quickly update the vaccine to target new variants should that become necessary. “We don’t expect to go through the full process of clinical trials again,” she said. “We will be talking to regulators about the exact procedure that we’re going to be going through for using these updated vaccines, but there’s precedent from flu vaccines. This is done every year for flu vaccines.”The results came as the UK government announced a partnership with the vaccine manufacturer CureVac to rapidly develop vaccines against new variants. The government has placed an initial order for 50m mRNA vaccines from CureVac to be delivered later this year if needed. Almost all of the vaccines developed by the partnership will be versions of an existing jab CureVac has in phase 3 clinical trials."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af8df6f6433fbcf91bbe36891156f41b8e877fdb/0_119_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=668023e48d3ea6ec43351dde471a1c7b","title":"unions call teachers wales vaccine when schools reopen coronavirus","story":" Ministers urged to give school staff priority for vaccines amid plans for younger pupils and apprentices to restart class Younger children in Wales will begin to return to school in person later this month despite concerns from teaching unions that safety measures for staff do not go far enough.Children in the foundation phase – those up to the age of seven – are to begin to return from 22 February and small numbers of vocational learners, including apprentices, will also be able to return to colleges.Twice-weekly testing for staff members will be offered, as well as increased financial support for new face coverings. But the government has resisted calls for teachers to be prioritised for vaccinations, insisting it will follow the order laid out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.The education minister, Kirsty Williams, said: “When you’re part of a government that has set up an independent group of experts to provide advice on how to roll out a vaccination programme, it would be very strange to ignore that advice.”Parents of older pupils in Wales are likely to hear a date for their children’s return when the results of the next three-weekly review is announced on 19 February.The Welsh government is starting to think ahead to the autumn and winter terms and looking at issues such as whether the summer holidays should be shortened to allow for a longer “firebreak” half-term and longer Christmas holidays.Williams said: “I think it’s important we try to take a longer-term view that allows us to plan more effectively. We do need to have those discussions. There is a seasonality element to Covid-19. Therefore we have to think about what will the autumn and winter look like.”Williams said falling infection rates in Wales had provided enough “headroom” for some pupils to return to school. “We have prioritised our youngest learners because of the favourable evidence on transmission in younger children, and also because we know they find it difficult to learn remotely.“Small numbers of vocational learners, including apprentices, will also be able to return to colleges. Again, this is because of difficulties with remote learning, as they will need to access training or workplace environments in order to undertake their practical qualifications.”Unions welcomed the safety measures but said more thought needed to be given to vaccinating teachers. Neil Butler, the NASUWT national official for Wales, said: “We are pleased with the mitigations that have been announced but they fall short of the list that we have given to Welsh government officials.”He said a call for vaccinations for education workers who could not socially distance “seems to be falling on deaf ears”, and added: “We are still pursuing this. We are also asking for education workers over 50 to be prioritised.”Dilwyn Roberts-Young, the general secretary of the Welsh teaching union UCAC, said: “We continue to call for the governments in Westminster and Wales to state when and how they intend to prioritise school staff for vaccination in order to ensure the continuity of our pupils’ education.”Earlier this week, the Scottish government said children in the first three years of primary school would return to classrooms from 22 February.The government in England has said its schools will not reopen before March.In Northern Ireland, where community transmission remains high, schools will also not fully reopen until 8 March at the earliest.In all four countries, schools and colleges have remained open throughout lockdowns for the children of critical workers and for those children classed as vulnerable."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4477275.1612545571!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert plans include exams and alternative assessment option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Norma Foley confirmed the move following a meeting with education stakeholders on Friday afternoon. File photograph: Bryan O’BrienPlanning has officially begun for a combination of Leaving Cert exams and an alternative assessment option which will not involve exams for students.Minister for Education Norma Foley confirmed the move following a meeting with education stakeholders on Friday afternoon.The Department of Education said these meetings have enabled “education partners to come to a shared understanding of the challenges facing the State Examinations this year and the urgency in meeting them”.The Minister is now inviting these education stakeholders to participate in “intensive, confidential bilateral discussions with department officials to progress work on two distinct processes for Leaving Certificate 2021”.This includes planning for examinations and scoping out a “corresponding measure, different to examinations that can also be offered to students”.It said discussions on junior cycle examinations will continue in these engagements.“These discussions will be focused and immediate. The Minister aims to provide clear plans and information to students as quickly as possible on how the examinations will be held and details of the corresponding measure to be offered to students,” the department said, in a statement.Ms Foley said the pandemic has impacted greatly on the learning experience of our Leaving Certificate 2021 students over the last year.“Even though our schools have made huge strides in remote learning, the closure of in-school provision has impacted on learning and preparedness for examinations, particularly for students at greater risk of educational disadvantage,” she said.“We must provide our students with a clear way to progress to the next stage in life – further and higher education and training or the world of work.“Students want certainty. They want fairness. They deserve both.“I am inviting the education partners to now engage intensively with the department in planning for the next steps, to enable decisions to be made and to bring much-needed certainty for students.”She said her department will be actively planning both to hold the Leaving Certificate examinations, and to put in place a corresponding measure that can also be offered to students.“The discussions in the examinations advisory subgroup have been hugely helpful in considering the many issues and challenges involved. Examinations need to be available to students. Given the impact on learning for students both last year and this year, there is also a need to explore a parallel approach which can be offered to students,” she said.“Any corresponding measure should have the confidence of the education partners.”She said that last year a process was put in place that involved schools generating estimated marks and the application of a national standardisation process. This allowed students to progress.“Any corresponding measure this year would need to incorporate new features. In particular, the State Examinations Commission will need to be given the necessary legal powers to run the process,” she said.“It will also need to provide more comprehensively for students studying outside school. Recognition of the skills and competencies associated with orals, practicals and coursework should also form a clearer part of any such measure. “She said that due to the nature of the pandemic, and the need to always have regard to public health advice, in addition to planning actively to hold the Leaving Certificate examinations, it is necessary to have in place a parallel measure that can also be offered to students.“I am committed to working with all the education partners to achieve this,” she added.The department has indicated to the education partners that any corresponding process would need to include the following features:A spokesman said decisions on how to move forward will be informed by a recognition of the disruption to the learning of students caused by Covid-19 and the need for smooth pathways of transitions to their next stage for students.Ms Foley added: “To all examination students: I recognise that this is a difficult period for you. We are working hard to provide the best possible solutions, so you can progress as you wish and deserve.“The work of the advisory subgroup, has enabled the students, parents, teachers, managerial bodies to come to a shared understanding of the challenges facing the State Examinations this year.“This next stage of confidential bilateral meetings with each of the partners is necessary to bring the work of the advisory group to a conclusion and forge a pathway for the students of 2021. I look forward to this engagement being completed in as short timeframe as possible.“Be assured, we will keep you updated as we make progress.

Tens of thousands of Russians joined recent protests in support of Mr Navalny and against Mr Putin, the country’s leader of 20 years, and about 10,000 were arrested in an often-violent police crackdown.Earlier on Friday, Mr Lavrov again rejected western criticism of its treatment of Mr Navalny and said Russia now viewed the EU as “an unreliable partner”.At the same time, both he and Mr Borrell said the EU and Moscow could co-operate in areas where their views and interests tallied, including in the possible provision of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine if it received EU approval.Mr Navalny was in court on Friday accused of slandering a second World War veteran who appeared in a pro-Kremlin video he called the trial “a kind of PR stunt because the Kremlin needs the headlines: ‘Navalny slandered a veteran’.”As his team announced that anti-Putin protests would resume in spring, Mr Navalny wrote on social media from prison: “The iron doors slammed shut behind me with a deafening clang, but I feel like a free person.

The meeting quickly degenerated into rancour with councillors in the village near Wilmslow trading insults and ultimately being booted off the Zoom call by the clerk.Footage of the extraordinary exchanges has been shared thousands of times on Twitter. The name of the heroically stoic clerk, Jackie Weaver, who was apparently parachuted in to run the meeting amid accusations of poor behaviour by councillors, became a Twitter trend on Thursday evening and spawned several memes.During the meeting, which took place on December 10th, 2021, chairman Brian Tolver was removed after the councillor refused to recognise the legitimacy of the meeting.In the recording, he told Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, adding: “You have no authority here”. In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room.After Mr Tolver’s eviction, vice-chair Aled Brewerton, joined by another man, proceeded to shout at Weaver to “read the standing orders”.When fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and a two further councillors, Mr Brewerton and Barry Burkill, were removed.The absurd scenes continued with confusion over Mr Tolver’s Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the “Handforth PC clerk”.Ms Weaver said: “The chairman simply declared himself ‘clerk’ and notified everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself clerk. Please refer to me as Britney Spears from now on.”Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with councillor Cynthia Samson likening one to a “laughing hyena”.The clips of the meeting were a hit with Twitter users, with more than 5,000 retweets and 32,000 likes. TV presenter Richard Osman tweeted: “Am busily writing Jackie Weaver into the next Thursday Murder Club novel.”Interviewed on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, Ms Weaver seemed to be enjoying her newfound fame, after her name was emblazoned on T-shirts saying “YOU HAVE NO AUTHORITY HERE JACKIE WEAVER”.She said she had been amused by some of the coverage of the meeting. “Clearly there’s amusement in the way somebody has just lost it,” she said. “It’s harsh to take some pleasure from that, but I’m afraid when you are being bullied, if you can see that the other person has lost it then there is the sense of ‘I did OK there because I managed to hold it together.’“There is an element of bullying and bad behaviour in local councils, and a lot of us are working very hard, and that includes central government, to try and do something about that.”She said at least 99.99 per cent of parish council meetings were not that exciting. “They are often less exciting than we might hope,” she said.But Mr Tolver was unrepentant, saying he had a “reason to be angry”. He told PA news agency that Ms Weaver “had no status to speak other than when invited”.He added: “I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualified member of the public like this.“Removing half the councillors from the meeting denied half of the voters of the village from being represented – it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights.”Normally sedate and well-mannered bodies, parish councils are the lowest tier of local government in England. They have few powers but can play an important role in providing representation and consultation with district and county councils in matters such as planning, environment and recreation.The extraordinary outbursts followed a series of complaints about the conduct of some councillors in the village and allegations of unlawful decisions that have resulted in expenditure of public funds, according to a notice posted on the council’s website by David Brown, director of governance and compliance at Cheshire district council.At the end of the meeting, the councillors debated whether a recording of their discussions should be released. One councillor presciently replied: “I think if this goes viral – it’s going to start a war of words.” – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4385961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"world view who is alexei navalny","story":"The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

Previous studies have shown that a greater ersity in bat species allows for more coronavirus to emerge. Given that each bat carries an average of 2.67 coronaviruses, the experts estimate that around 100 more viruses are circulating in Yunnan now than at the beginning of the 20th century.Although Yunnan is around 120 miles away from Wuhan, where the Covid outbreak began, it is thought the ancestral virus may have first evolved there and could have been exported through the trafficking of pangolins. Dr Robert Beyer, a researcher at the University of Cambridge\u0027s Department of Zoology, said: Climate change over the last century has made the habitat in Yunnan province suitable for more bat species.Understanding how the global distribution of bat species has shifted as a result of climate change may be an important step in reconstructing the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak.As climate change altered habitats, species left some areas and moved into others, taking their viruses with them. This not only altered the regions where viruses are present but most likely allowed for new interactions between animals and viruses, causing more harmful viruses to be transmitted or evolve.However, experts commenting on the research said factors other than climate change were also likely to play a role in the virus.Kate Jones, a professor of ecology and bioersity at University College London, said: Climate change certainly has a role to play in changing species distributions to increase ecological hazard. However, spillover risk is a complex interplay of not only ecological hazard but also human exposure and vulnerability. It may turn out that increases in human populations, human movement and degrading natural environments through agricultural expansion have a more important role to play in understanding the spillover process of SARS-CoV-2. The study was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"just 3 1000 britons reporting side effects covid vaccine","story":"The Oxford vaccine is capable of fighting the UK Covid variant, a new study shows.The UK variant is thought to be between 40 and 70 per cent more infectious and is believed to have driven the huge spike in virus cases at the end of last year. It also may be 30 per cent more deadly.The Oxford jab was designed to work against the original virus, and there were fears that the mutated variant would be able to evade immunity.Researchers took swabs from infected people involved in vaccine trials between October 1 and January 14 to see which version of the virus they had picked up. They found protection against symptomatic infection was similar despite lower neutralising antibody titres in vaccinated iniduals against the B.1.1.7 variant than the original strain.These are the first findings on the efficacy of the Oxford vaccine against new variants. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity  and the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: Data from our trials of the ChAdOx1 vaccine in the United Kingdom indicate that the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus but also protects against the novel variant, B.1.1.7, which caused the surge in disease from the end of 2020 across the UK.The new study also shows that vaccination results in a reduction in the duration of shedding and viral load, which may translate into reduced virus transmission.Vaccine researchers are already looking at ways to modify existing vaccines quickly and simply to protect against new variants, but the study findings suggest that will not be necessary for the UK mutation.Sarah Gilbert, professor of vaccinology and the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: We have always expected that, as the pandemic continues, new variants will begin to become dominant amongst the viruses that are circulating and that eventually a new version of the vaccine, with an updated spike protein, would be required to maintain vaccine efficacy at the highest level possible.We are working with AstraZeneca to optimise the pipeline required for a strain change should one become necessary. This is the same issue that is faced by all of the vaccine developers, and we will continue to monitor the emergence of new variants that arise in readiness for a future strain change.Meanwhile, just three in 1,000 Britons are reporting side-effects from coronavirus vaccines, with most people suffering mild flu-like symptoms or sore arms, the first safety analysis has shown.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has been monitoring side-effects through its Yellow Card scheme since the vaccine rollout began. The first data, released on Friday, show that just 22,820 incidents were reported out of 6.9 million doses given between Dec 9 and Jan  24.The Oxford jab accounted for more reports of side-effects, with 6,014 reports from 1.5 million vaccinations (0.4 per cent) compared with 16,756 reports from the 5.4 million Pfizer jabs (0.3 per cent).It is the first time the population scale impact of an Mrna vaccine such as the Pfizer jab has been known.Most of the reactions we are seeing are mild, mostly lasting for a short time, said Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicines\u0027 Covid-19 Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group. We haven\u0027t identified any unexpected serious adverse reactions. The benefits of the Covid-19 vaccines outweigh the risks.A detailed report showed that a minority of people had experienced more serious conditions. The MHRA received 69 reports of facial paralysis or paresis with the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. Six reports of facial paralysis were received for the AstraZenecaOxford vaccine.There were also 107 UK reports of deaths related to the PfizerBioNTech vaccine in which the patient died shortly after vaccination, 34 reports for the AstraZenecaOxford vaccine and two in which the brand of vaccine was unspecified.However, the MHRA pointed out that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows that for every 100,000 over-80s vaccinated, 200 will die with natural causes within a week. Things will happen to people naturally, and what we have to figure out is whether that is causal or whether that\u0027s a coincidence, said Dr Philip Bryan, the vaccines safety lead at the MHRA. Twenty thousand sounds like a big number – but it\u0027s three reports per thousand, and this is telling us that the safety is pretty much what it was in the trials.More than 10 million doses of the PfizerBioNTech and Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca vaccines  have now been given to people across the UK, including 90 per cent of the over-80s.The results show that most side-effects are in line with most types of vaccines, and more are happening in the younger population. Dr June Raine, the MHRA chief executive, said: Vaccines are the most effective way to protect against Covid-19 and save lives and prevent serious complications from this terrible virus.The data we have collected provides further reassurance that the Covid-19 vaccines are safe and continue to meet the rigorous regulatory standards required for all vaccines. We remain confident that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh any risks.Our priority is to ensure the public have safe and effective vaccines and we will continue to analyse, monitor and review all the safety data for these vaccines.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"say going school simply benefits children cruelly misleading","story":"Listening to a press conference given earlier this week by the CMO Chris Whitty, I was struck by a turn of phrase.  Whitty talked of school as a “benefit” to children.  Schools must stay closed, we were told, because anything else would risk overwhelming the NHS. And because, you see, one apparently has to weigh up two sets of arguments: furrowing his brow because this formula, let’s call it the “Whitty Theory of Relativity”, was going to be hard for us to understand.  On the one hand, there’s the “benefit to children” of being in school, and on the other, the need to “hold the line” against Covid.  Apparently these two sets of arguments are “not disputed by anybody”- it’s really just a question of when to balance them.These words, no doubt carefully chosen, are casually yet cruelly misleading.  The Government’s own scientific advisers yesterday broke ranks to opine that “you could reopen primary schools after the February half term” and that this “is not immediately going to create large numbers of people in hospitals”. But even leaving this aside the net impact on children of \u0027no school’ is not a denial of benefit - school is not the cherry on the cake to which these lucky little lambs, class of 2020, are being treated after a stroll in the park.  In fact being out of school for this long is highly damaging to most children - our current, sorry, status quo for children is in fact a state of harm.  Looking at my own children I am now convinced that the prolonged nature of these school closures and the denial of socialisation and communal play that they have entailed has made all children, even the more fortunate, vulnerable. So when Sage scientists give Ministers the rope they need to bring forward their self-imposed deadline of 8th March, they should embrace this with open arms as the great news it is: there is nothing safe or humane about what we are doing to our children and we should not be surprised to learn that the longer this goes on the greater the toll it will take on even the strongest of them.  The increasingly rapid deterioration of my own children into disengagement and something materially less chirpy than the excitable kids they used to be, is painful to watch. It is all the more painful because I never signed up to the premise of the Whitty Theory.  Sure I want the NHS to be protected, but I don’t consent for this to be ‘at all costs’ and certainly not at the cost of my children’s long-term health and welfare.  Closing schools in the name of protecting the NHS sets a terrifying precedent with desperately serious repercussions from which many children might never fully recover.  In treating schooling and the socialisation of children as just another lever to be pulled in a battle against a virus which is likely to become endemic we’ve allowed their education to become negotiable.  Worse still we’ve implicitly accepted there are circumstances in which it is okay knowingly to harm all children in the interests of protecting some adults.You don’t need to be Einstein to see the lack of relativity in this equation and I feel compelled to speak out against it.What we are doing to children in the name of protecting the NHS is wrong we’ve skewed the scales against the rights and interests of those who don’t have a voice to object, or to vote.  Others may not agree with my view of the balance of harms, though I believe there are many thousands of parents, grandparents, teachers, doctors who do.  But even for those who do not agree, surely we owe it to these children, who will be our country’s next generation of parents, grandparents, teachers, doctors, nurses and other key workers, to be honest about the terms of the debate, and about what harms, losses and sacrifices must be weighed.   We owe them at least that.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories can provide conservative response devolution without","story":"The prime minister is not a man who is careful with his words. If he thinks before he speaks, there is remarkably little evidence of it. Last November, a story emerged that he had described devolution as “a disaster north of the border”, calling it Tony Blair’s “biggest mistake”. It did nothing to soothe a Scottish electorate who currently support independence from the United Kingdom at something like the Devil’s ratio of 5248.It matters hardly at all whether Boris Johnson was right. The fact is that devolution has been part of the UK’s constitutional landscape for 20 years, and, for all but the crustiest of old-school Tories, it is here to stay. There is as little sense in regretting it as in a sea captain regretting the weather.If the Conservative Party continues to be a grudging participant in the devolved assemblies, and if it mentally writes off the London mayoralty as well, it will create a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat and marginalisation. It will become the party of the English towns and shires, with only a distant cousin or two on the Celtic fringes. But it doesn’t have to be this way.Johnson and his party must declare a Pol Pot-style Year Zero on decentralisation. They must embrace the possibilities of devolution wholeheartedly, and must go further. If they are clever, and joined-up, they will anchor a new love for local autonomy to their professed desire for “levelling-up”, and present themselves as the party of opportunity, competition and ersity, in all its forms.The Covid-19 crisis has shone a spotlight on some of the elected mayors in the English regions. Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester and Sir Peter Soulsby in Leicester showed that, in an emergency, there was far more influence to be had by a locally grounded leader with a mandate from the community he or she serves but they came head-to-head with a lack of power to effect change. That must stop, and the needle must move in the opposite direction.The UK is a remarkably unbalanced polity. There is London, and there is everywhere else. This will never be reversed, but the balance can be shifted by the creation of powerful city and region bosses who have control over the economic levers of their domains, and by the acceptance of loss of direct control by Whitehall. Our great cities—Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast—should be dynamic economic centres where wealth creation can be channelled into the most fertile areas: financial services in Edinburgh, the creative industries in Manchester, manufacturing in Birmingham.The mayors of these venerable cities and their surrounding areas should be capable, well-known, activist politicians (or even non-politicians): the Tories should shout much more loudly about Andy Street in the West Midlands and Ben Houchen on Teesside. Here you see people dedicated to the communities and focused on growth and prosperity.There will be one unpopular factor in Whitehall and at Conservative HQ: as things stand, many of these mayors will not be Tories. But if Boris Johnson wants a vision for a different, levelled-up UK, he must accept this short-term abdication of power. If the Conservatives have the right ideas and the right people, the electorate will come to them, as they have in the Red Wall seats.Perhaps the prime minister can grasp the thorniest constitutional nettle of all, reform of the House of Lords. The days of the upper House as a Tory redoubt are gone the government is in a minority in the Lords, and the Liberal Democrats, with 87 peers, are disproportionately influential. Be bold. Seize the initiative. But do not outline options. The PM and his brainiest advisers should devise a model of a second chamber that suits the system and (to an extent) suits them, and they should propose it. Let it be yes or no, and put proponents of other models in the trenches with the diehards who want the status quo. We had stage one of House of Lords reform in 1999. We have been waiting rather too long for stage two.Reforming the constitutional arrangements of the UK is never sexy. It always seems less important than a public health crisis or a stalling economy or our relations with our nearest neighbours. It is important, but not urgent. But if Johnson wants a legacy, imagine the one he could have: a UK in which power was devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with strong Conservative representation in the first two. Great cities on a European scale, run by businessmen and entrepreneurs as well as party hacks. Les grands prôjets. Think how we could look in 2030, with Covid and Brexit behind us.

Before the Coronavirus lockdowns the playground had been feeding children and parents daily. “We’d always have the slow cooker going, especially in the winter, always a stew or a soup, remembers Kylie.Our approach is always very informal, easy access, the children and their parents would know they could help themselves whenever they liked. People then felt secure enough to kind of say ‘I’m struggling this month’ and we could put a little box together for them.”  Although PYC’s kitchens have had to close during lockdowns, they’ve been providing food parcels to families across Portsmouth.Holly Easlick, Health Development Officer for the council, tells us how FareShare – the UK’s largest food redistribution charity – helped: “During the first lockdown FareShare were able to deliver us more food than ever so we were able to get it out to the families who needed it. Kylie stresses how vital this contact with vulnerable families is: “With Covid-, the food was a big thing to help us continue our interaction with the families. Families that struggle with food provision, there are people truly in need.” She adds: “Itaposs also about that weekly interaction. A lot of our families struggle with mental health, so that idea that they knew they could come down every week and get a food package, and also see us, talk to us was one of the most important things.Even though it was just kind of over the gate, we were able to have a conversation and it was a way in to seethere were other ways they were struggling and we could support them.”  FareShare is a network of  independent organisations with more than  warehouses right across the UK. The charity takes food that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors, short shelf le or over production, and redistribute it through a network of , frontline organisations.The food FareShare redistributes is nourishing and fresh – the same as the food you’d eat at home. Homeless hostels, school breakfast clubs, domestic violence refuges, older people’s lunch clubs, food banks and hospices all depend on FareShare’s help. Ninety per cent of these charities have seen demand reach crisis levels since the pandemic started, and they’re preparing for even more people to find themselves in need this winter. Over the coming months, FareShare will also be delivering food to night shelters and school holiday projects to reach even more people who are struggling. This winter Barclays is working with FareShare to help raise vital funds. With approximately .m people in the UK currently living in food poverty, the amount of food that’s currently wasted is shocking. It’s estimated that a third of all food produced is wasted, at a cost of £b.  FareShare is committed to ensuring that food that would otherwise be wasted gets redistributed with frontline charities and community groups. Barclaysapos £m Covid- Community Aid Package was established to help charities continue to carry out the vital work they do. It’s pledging support to organisations that are helping people affected by the crisis. To support this peak in winter demand, Barclays is pledging to donate £ for every £ you donate to FareShare through the link or text number below, up to £m, until  February.

But this yearaposs polls, due on May , will go ahead in England – despite fears the pandemic would force another delay. The Cabinet Office said polls could go ahead safely, as it expected to have vaccinated the top nine priority groups by May. A bumper set of votes are due to be held across England, with electors choosing a mixture of councillors, local mayors, regional mayors and police commissioners. In London, there will be elections for the mayor and assembly, which were originally due to take place last year. Voters will have to wear face masks at polling stations and will also be asked to bring their own pens and pencils. There will be ider screens and hand sanitiser to help curb the spread of coronavirus. Postal and proxy voting will be allowed, with applications open until or working days before the polls. A new emergency proxy vote will be available until pm on polling day, so anyone who is self isolating can request a vote at the last minute. Leafleting and door-knocking by activists is not allowed under the national lockdown so political parties are encourages to campaign online. The Government said parties will be informed nearer the time about when face-to-face campaigning can resume.

Boris Johnson pledged to set out a roadmap on how Englandaposs national lockdown will be lted in the week of February , with officials expressing quiet confidence that the PMaposs mid-February target for vaccinating the  million most vulnerable people will be met. The Government revealed that it aims to vaccinate all the over s by early May, as it announced that local elections would go ahead on May . Mr Johnson has pointed to Easter as a point when lockdown restrictions would be substantially lted, saying it could be a very, very dferent world by then. But ministers are being cautious not to raise the hopes of the lockdown-weary public by setting dates, but some scientists have started predicting the path to freedom from restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock previously set four tests for lting lockdown measures. They are:Another major, new iant is not causing dficulties The vaccination rollout is working Hospitalisation numbers are reducing  The number of deaths are coming downThe Prime Minister is pinning his hopes on the continued success of the vaccine programme, but he warned on Wednesday that hospitalisations remain forbiddingly high. However he is under pressure from Tory MPs to lt restrictions as soon as possible - a clamour that is likely to grow in the coming days. Hereaposs what we know so far on how and when the restrictions could be lted. Plans are still being worked out, so we may not find out the full details until the Prime Minister sets out his roadmap later this month. Schools will be the first thing to open  The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that getting pupils back in the classroom is the first priority. March  has been pencilled in for the partial reopening of schools in England, with primary schools likely to be the first to . Pupils in exam years - year  and  - could also go back earlier, even though GCSEs and A-Levels have been scrapped this year. Parents and schools have been promised two weeks notice on when face-to-face teaching can resume.  The idea behind the March  date is it would allow a three-week window from the mid-February deadline for the top priority groups to get the jabs. This would give enough time for immunity to kick in for he most vulnerable. But Mr Johnson is facing pressure from his own MPs and teachers to open schools sooner, with growing calls for teachers to be vaccinated in the second phase of the rollout. Outdoor activities could follow  The next area where rules could be relaxed is outdoor exercise and socialising. People are currently barred from any outdoor meet-ups, except for exercise within their household or bubble, or with one other person. The PM is said to be considering letting team and inidual sports go ahead in the open air, where transmission of the virus is lower. Limited social gatherings outside could also be on the cards, the Times reported.  There could be ato limits on numbers of people who can meet up, similar to the rule of six last year, which allowed you to meet up to five others. Dr Mike Tildesley, an expert on the Govermentaposs modelling group, said the idea of ato outdoor activity was slightly concerning and urged caution. Pressed on whether outdoor socialising next month seemed reasonable, he said a little bit more mixing outdoors might be reasonable but would need very clear messaging from the Government. It is not clear when gyms and exercise classes would be able to resume. Non-essential shops may also start to open  Only essential shops, such as supermarkets, pharmacies and garden centres, have been allowed to stay open during the national lockdown. But it is likely that they will be among the next things to reopen when national restrictions begin to lt. Under the tiers system, non-essential shops were allowed to keep their doors open, with Covid safety measures, except in the toughest Tier  areas. It may depend whether the UK s to a tiered system or the whole country comes out of lockdown at the same time. Open air markets are likely to open before indoor shops. A Whitehall source recently told the : “We have to avoid the situation last time where theof schools meant far greater household mixing across the board. “So that means weaposd be likely to wait at least another month for non-essential retail, and a month beyond that at least for pubs and restaurants. This could mean that shops start to open again in early April, possibly after Easter Sunday on April . But pubs and restaurants are likely to stay closed for longer  Hospitality venues were among the last places to reopen after the first lockdown due to the risks of transmission of the virus. SAGE experts have pointed to May as a possible time for pubs and restaurants to reopen - which could coincide with the bank holiday weekend. If the Government meets its target to vaccinate the over s by early May, this could make it safer to open up hospitality. Even then, pubs and restaurants faced a number of restrictions on how they could operate. Allowing takeaway pints and food could be the first stage of easing restrictions, or allowing al fresco dining. The rules on household mingling will also be a factor, depending on whether you can socialise with friends or people you donapost live with indoors. Mr Johnson is believed to be keen to simply the rules, including scrapping the widely ridiculed requirement for people to have a substantial meal with their pints, which applied in some tiers.

Ministers and government officials have spent weeks denying plans are being drawn up for documents showing who has been inoculated and allowing them to travel abroad. But today it was reported a certication system is being worked on. Tourism chiefs in Greece said UK holidaymakers could be welcomed to its hotspots later this year. Greek Hoteliersapos Federation President Grigoris Tasios told the Times: Greece has long been a favourite holiday destination for the British. “But with the rate of inoculations in the UK largely outpacing all others across Europe and beyond, British travellers will be among the safest to travel here by as early as May. Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly said it would be up to countries where holidaymakers were arriving to decide on travel passports. It is often the case that the entry requirements for countries are for vaccines or inoculations, and that is not an uncommon practice,” he told the BBC. We will work with international partners to help facilitate their border arrangements and their immigration arrangements. He added: “The decisions that inidual countries make about their own incoming arrangements is obviously up to them. We are incredibly proud of the speed and the breadth of our vaccination rollout and of course, I think the whole world hopes, that the vaccination programme will be a way of getting back to normality. Travel industry chiefs welcomed the possibility of vaccine visas allowing tourists to head for foreign beaches. An Association of British Travel Agents spokeswoman said: “It is sensible to have the option of some sort of proof of vaccination, because that evidence, alongside testing, is likely to be part of the way to re-opening travel. “Waiting for the full rollout of the vaccination programme to be completed in the UK before people start to travel overseas would mean another summer season lost to the pandemic. “We need a reopening strategy that keeps up with the developing medical situation and with medical understanding, as well as recognising other countries may have dfering policies on how and when they accept vaccinated travellers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccines safe adverse effects","story":"NewsCoronavirus vaccines are safe with adverse effects in just  out of every , casesThe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has received , reports of suspected side effects from the coronavirus vaccine - or three in every , doses administeredmirrorShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsThree out of every , people reported an adverse side effect\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencycollated reports to its “yellow card” scheme after seven million doses were delivered up to January . The scheme invited patients to flag any adverse reactions and received , reports - three in every , doses administered.The vast majority were mild and short-lived - mainly sore arm and fever, as well as chills, muscle aches and headaches.Out of seven million vaccinated patients there were  adverse reactions where they died in the days following vaccination. There were  for the Pfizer vaccine and  for the Oxford jab, and two where the vaccine type was unspecied. Dr Philip Bryan, MHRA vaccines safety lead, said: “These are people with underlying illnesses where another cause was the reason for the death. “This was quite clear and we do follow them all. “When you look at the incidence rates, I think it’s more than , people over  already would have died within a week of the vaccine by natural causes. “So that  didn’t raise alarms both in the numbers but also in the details of the cases, but obviously we take every report seriously. We look at all of them and keep them under review.” Britain’s vaccination scheme started with the most elderly and vulnerable and the MHRA is keen to establish the impact of any side effects. The yellow card scheme is designed as an early warning system for major side effects.  However reports also established that some form of side effects were more likely in younger age groups. Clinical trials have found that one in ten participants would experience cold-like symptoms - a similar rate to the flu jab. The MHRA found they usually passed within  hours, with a minority lasting up to five days. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human Medicines’ Covid- Vaccines Benefit Risk Expert Working Group, said: “The benefits of these vaccines far outweigh any risks. “It does seem to be that adverse reactions side effects are more common in the younger rather than the older group. “We know that the immune system does change as you get older.  The immune system is really complex and we don’t have the knowledge to determine why the immune system ies so much between dferent iniduals.” There were  cases of severe anaphylaxis allergic reactions with the Pfizer jab, but none were fatal. This triggered a change in MHRA guidance so that vaccines were not offered to patients with an allergy to any of the vaccineaposs ingredients. There were also  reports of facial paralysis, but the MHRA concluded that “the number of reports is similar to the expected natural rate and does not currently suggest an increased risk following the vaccines”. The MHRA has also published today the first of what will be regular Covid- vaccine safety reports. Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, said: “I think we also ought to recognise that where we are today is that more than , people have sadly lost their lives from Covid-.

An average of , new symptomatic cases are being reported every day in the UK - down from , at the start of the year. The figures are from the Zoe Covid Symptom Study UK Infection Survey app, which tracks around one million Britsapos symptoms. The app identied Dorset, Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, London and Liverpool as the highest risk areas in the UK. Professor Tim Spector OBE, lead scientist for the Zoe app, said the number of new cases is now the same as when the UK left lockdown at the end of November. He added: “We are making good progress against this virus, with  million vaccinations done and cases down by % since the peak at the beginning of the year. On top of that, we are also seeing hospital admissions from Covid drop too. But it’s not the time for hesitancy. We’re now at the same levels of new cases we were when we came out of lockdown at the end of November, with the dference being our NHS is overstretched and death rates are still high.

Little Jasmine Holt has been determined to walk at least three to five miles each day in “snow or rain” in order to make sure that everyone is happy. The thoughtful girl told her mum Abbey Mills, , that she never wants “anybody to be sad” and hopes that her daily trips will bring some joy to people’s days. Her neighbours in Westhoughton, Lancs., have spotted her skipping and strutting dressed as a doctor, a rainbow and even a poo - as she says “it’s okay to feel like a poo sometimes”. She drags her mum on two to three walks a day and hopes to walk roughly  miles by the end of Children’s Mental Health Week  which ends on Sunday. She is raising funds for Placebe, a charity that provides mental health counselling and support for schools. So far she has smashed her goal of £ by nearly ten times after raising more than £, in just a few days. Jasmine said: “It’s okay not to be okay andyou feel like you’re not okay it’s most important to talk to somebody. “It’s okay to feel like a poo sometimes. “I just want everyone to be loved. I never want anyone to be sad. “I want people to know how amazing they are. “We need to go out so we can help people in rain or snow.” Her proud mum Abbey said she’s been crying for days as she couldn’t be prouder of her little girl - even when she dressed up as a giant poo. Abbey, who is a single parent to Jasmine and two two-year-old twins Sophia and Emilia, said that the charity meant a lot to her as she struggled with mental health issues in school. The service manager said: “Mental health in children is so important, especially this year. “She’s only five but she’s the kindest soul, she always tells me how she never wants anyone to be sad.  “She’s the kindest soul and she just wants to make people happy. She’s very aware and educated about what’s happening. “The other day she dressed as a giant poo. She said it’s okay to not feel okay and sometimes you feel like a bit of a poo. “It was one of the proudest moments of my le as a mum to see her dressed as a poo.

A bizarre clip of a Handforth Parish Council meeting has been viewed nearly three million times after being posted on social media. The footage, taken from a planning and environment meeting last year, showed councillors trading insults - and ultimately getting booted off the call. Jackie Weaver assumed the role of clerk in the meeting and is the person tasked with controlling the increasingly angry situation. She is accused of having no authority by chair Brian Tolver before she removes him - and later kicks out two others for their behaviour.What do you think about the parish council meeting  Let us know in the comments below.Speaking to BBC Radio aposs Womanaposs Hour this morning, Ms Weaver said she was surprised by the sudden fame and appreciates the support she had received. She said: The surprise comes in large part because, actually . per cent - thataposs an actual fact Iaposm sure - of council meetings are just not like that. Iaposve had nothing but really lovely, positive support from people who, of course, condemn the behaviour. Nobody could not condemn that. For me it’s about being focused on what you’re trying to achieve. I was there to support the three councillors that wanted to get on with the often dull business a parish council has in looking to do stuff for its community. Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, also revealed her top tip for appearing on Zoom calls during the pandemic. She said: It’s so tempting to just put on a face and think that’s all you see [on Zoom] so it’s okayI’m wearing my slippers and pyjama bottoms. But for me it has a change in your own personal attitudeyou know that you’re together irrespective of whether they can see your pyjama bottoms or not.  The footage, taken from a meeting on December , contains insults, shouting and swear words. The meeting marked the second time chair Brian Tolver had been removed, having previously been evicted from an earlier Zoom call. Mr Tolver said today that he did not regret how he had acted in the meeting - as another councillor said a probe has been launched over the incident. He said Ms Weaver - who hosted the Zoom call and removed him from it - was just present as a member of the public and had no status to speak other than when invited. He said: If you look at the first meeting you will see I have reason to be angry. Mr Tolver is seen claiming the agenda was concealed in the first meeting and, following a series of interjections and claims the meeting was not legitimate, he was eventually removed. The .pm extraordinary meeting began with an unseen councillor mumbling f*** off under their breath. Mr Tolver refused to recognise the legitimacy of both meetings. He told meeting clerk Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking, and added: You have no authority here. In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room. Mr Tolver said: I cannot think of any other council meeting anywhere, that was taken over by an unqualied member of the public like this. Removing half the councillors from the meeting, denied half of the voters of the village from being represented - it was an appalling attack on their democratic rights. This made tensions rise, and that is why voices were raised in the second meeting. In the second meeting, I was trying to explain the correct procedure to this lady and say that her actions were way out of order, but she seems to have believed that she could do whatever she chose. Following Mr Tolveraposs eviction, vice-chair Aled Brewerton, joined by an older unnamed gentleman, proceeded to yell at Ms Weaver to read the standing orders.  When fellow councillor Susan Moore called for civility, the meeting erupted into semi-hysterical laughter and two further councillors, Mr Brewerton and Barry Burkill were removed. There was then confusion over Mr Tolveraposs Zoom username, in which he had labelled himself the clerk. Ms Weaver said: The chairman simply declared himself aposclerkapos and notied everybody of the case. There is no way of stopping him from calling himself aposclerkapos. Please refer to me as aposBritney Spearsapos from now on. Those remaining voted to not allow the three men back into the meeting, with councillor Cynthia Samson likening one to a laughing hyena. Mr Tolver, who previously labelled the clips shared on YouTube as corrupt copies, said they were hooky videos and added: Whether they are completely genuine or not, I donapost know. Ms Moore said that the call is subject to an investigation and could not expand further on what happened when asked by the Mirror. She said: Iaposm so sorry, I really canapost talk about it. It has been an ongoing investigation for some months now. We hope it will come to a conclusion fairly soon.

But rewind two years and Kate feared she’d be left a widow at  bringing up their little boy alone, after their world fell apart when husband Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Determined not to give up their dream of expanding their family, just three days after Phil’s diagnosis, he had his sperm frozen before starting chemotherapy. And that act of hope in the most devastating week of the couple’s le resulted in daughter Autumn - their “light at the end of the tunnel” – born on October , . Phil is now recovering well and the couple feel blessed they’ve got a second chance of happiness. “Our little girl is a symbol of hope and new beginnings for us as a growing family,” said Kate, , from Surrey. “It’s amazing knowing that Autumn was conceived with sperm frozen in the week her daddy was diagnosed with a brain tumour. After everything we’ve been through, for the first time in years we’re excited about le and our future looks bright.” Autumn’s birth was even more poignant as Kate had suffered six miscarriages trying to give Austin, now four – who was conceived in the couple’s first IVF attempt – the precious gt of a sibling. She lost three babies before Phil’s diagnosis and three while he was going through treatment using frozen embryos from treatment the first time round with Austin. “It was an emotional rollercoaster,” said Kate. “Phil was undergoing radiotherapy while I was having injections to stimulate my egg production. “I had three miscarriages over six months during his treatment, the first at six-and-half weeks and the other two at five weeks.” The couple decided to give having another baby “one final go” using the sperm Phil, , had frozen in the same week doctors told him he had a brain tumour.The couple’s ordeal started in November  when Phil was diagnosed with a brain tumour after suffering severe headaches, dizziness and tingling and numbness on his left-hand side. Doctors put the symptoms down to a sinus infection and then vertigo. Phil’s headaches intensied and sometimes he’d have to go to bed because he was in so much pain and nauseous. After five months, he saw a private GP through work and was referred for a scan, which revealed a large tumour spanning both hemispheres of his brain. Phil received the devastating news on his own as he hadn’t spotted the consultant’s email that they’d found an “anomaly” on his brain, and to bring someone with him. “He’d had an early appointment before work and I was woken up at am by the phone ringing,” said Kate. “Phil said, ‘It’s not good news, I’ve got a lump in my head that shouldn’t be there.’ “I think I stopped breathing. I was cuddled up with Austin and just couldn’t take in his words. He was a fit, healthy -year-old, brain tumours weren’t even on our radar. “The doctor told him to go home. On the train, Phil was on the phone to me and we were both crying. I went to meet him at the station with Austin and we clung to each other.” Kate couldn’t help herself fearing the worst. “My first thought was, ‘I’m going to be a widow at ,” she said. “Austin was only two and I was convinced Phil wouldn’t see him grow up and that we’d never have any more children. One minute le was normal, the next it was scary and unknown.”  Two days later, the couple went to see Phil’s consultant who broke the news he thought Phil’s tumour was cancerous. “We were told that Phil had to have surgery soon or he could die,” said Kate. “My mind went spiralling into a dark place as I thought we were going to lose him imminently. “Phil was so shocked he nearly got sick. “Then I asked about freezing Phil’s sperm as it was so important to both of us to have another child. “On the way home on the train everyone was enjoying their night out while he was white as a sheet and I was hysterical. “Back at home, I was straight on google and read that Phil’s prognosis may be  months, which made me feel even worse.” They coped by going into practical mode. “Phil dealt with our finances and I had a crash course in where everything was,” said Kate. “We didn’t have wills and did those, too. “Everything was sorted out in four days flat before Phil’s surgery.” Austin was only two when Phil was diagnosed but the couple were open as possible with him. “We told him, ‘Daddy has a poorly head’ and that he was having treatment to make him better,” said Kate.

The cordon stretched for hundreds of square metres across woodland and a field, near Brackmills Industrial Estate. Trin, whose house backs on to Cherry Orchard, said: “It’s pretty scary how something like this can happen like this right on your doorstep. David, who has made a habit of exercising in the woodland since gyms closed and was out running this morning, said: “It’s quite unnerving to think I might have been walking past [human bones] this whole time. “I hope the police find out what happened.” The cordon was set up after police were called on Tuesday afternoon by a member of the public who had said they had discovered the remains. The large crime scene is even visible from the A, with the area being set up alongside the Nene Valley Way.

The pavements outside Victoria station and Westminster Cathedral were hotspots for homeless people just  months ago - due to the constant stream of pedestrians. But for the likes of Rorey Ennis, who canapost be trusted in hostels, it means loneliness and little chance of food or spare change. The -year-old, originally from Birmingham, said he survives day-to-day, reports MyLondon. Sat in front of a Pret a Manger beside Victoria’s main entrance on what in normal times would have been a busy Wednesday afternoon , Rorey explains this part of London is now eerily sparse. Are you homeless and sleeping rough  Contact us at webnews@mirror   It is more lonely than it used to be, he says. You spend days waiting to speak to someone. Originally from Birmingham, Mr Ennis has been sleeping rough since I was  years old, and has been in London for four years. I mostly hang around Victoria and Westminster and stayed here through all the lockdowns, he explains.  I usually sleep in my mate’s tent by the cathedral. There are hostels, but I don’t go to them, I can’t be trusted in a property. I’m surviving by just doing it day by day. Sometimes people will pop into Pret to get you something. At .pm over in Piccadilly Circus, a rough sleeper who asks not to be named says he arrived in London from Cardf two weeks ago. “I don’t get any benefits, says the -year-old. I rely on getting my food and money from donations. Today I’ve had a panini and a sausage roll and two coffees. I go to public toilets when I can, but they close at night. Like Mr Ennis, he says there are not many rough sleepers around Piccadilly Circus – an area where heavy footfall once made it an attractive location to pick up donations from passers by.  He continues: There have been outreach people and that’s it… They tell you where to go for housing or where to get food and a tent or clothes. I keep myself to myself and I sometimes see more rough sleepers around Charing Cross station. At night time I’m mostly outside. Since I’ve been in London I’ve been able to sleep in a hostel twice. They’re often full. Asked whether he’s felt scared of catching Covid-, he simply replies: F*** the pandemic.  At about .pm, Boyd Seagal is waiting in The Strand with a dozen other homeless people, including his partner, for a group of volunteers to arrive who will set up tables and lay out free food. The -year-old says: My partner and I have been homeless together in London for about a year. I have moved around a lot but I have been homeless at dferent stages since I was six years old. I left London and carried on to Mansfield and Nottingham and then Chesterfield, Derbyshire and Scotland. Mr Seagal suggests an answer as to why the capital’s historic centre appears to have fewer rough sleepers than might have been expected. Recently my partner and I have been coming to Charing Cross every day, he said. We walk from Wandsworth and all the way back. We have been put in separate rooms in a hostel in Wandsworth for  days. We started there two weeks ago. You get showers and bits and pieces and a chance to do your washing. A study by the charity St Mungo’s and the Greater London Authority shows that the number of people sleeping rough in the borough of Westminster fell markedly between July to September and October to December. The number of rough sleepers counted by outreach workers during the last quarter of the year was , which was  fewer than the previous quarter. This figure was also lower than when the same study was carried out in October to December  - when  rough sleepers were spotted. Petra Salva, from St Mungo’s, said: Since March, our teams in Westminster – in partnership with the local council - have been working round the clock to make sure as many people as possible are provided with accommodation so they are protected from Covid- as well as the other risks associated with being street homeless. And we know from [the data] that a signicant reduction in the number of people sleeping rough in Westminster has been achieved. However, this is not a static issue and there are people still coming to the streets who need and deserve immediate protection and long-term support. Westminster Council currently has more than  supported accommodation beds in use for homeless people, and a further  beds in two assessment centres. The council says it has helped  people into accommodation since March . Councillor Heather Acton, cabinet member for communities, said: Our outreach teams continued to work day and night over the Christmas period and will do so over cold winter spells. They will provide essential support tailored to each inidual finding themselves living on the streets in Westminster. Not only will this help them to access safe accommodation, but also essential mental health, drug and alcohol addiction services, work skills training and ultimately employment. Thus breaking the cycle of rough sleeping, offering long-term solutions rather than quick fixes.

Colouring pens, biros, paper, glue sticks, hand sanitiser and folders were among items delivered to Cubitt Town Junior School on the Isle of Dogs in East London. Head teacher Robyn Bruce told how the stock was “vital” for younger children home learning in deprived areas, many of who do not have access to the basics. The Mirror, in a joint appeal with the National Education Union , is urging readers and firms to dig deep to help kids struggling to learn at home.Tell us your thoughts on the Help a Child to Learn campaign in the comments belowSchool mum Khadija Khatun, , lives on the th floor of a tower block with her husband and five children - aged , , ,  and . As she was handed items from the delivery, she told the Mirror: “It’s really hard at home. “The school gave us a computer, and that’s great, but we also need other things which we have to go and buy.  “We really need scissors, glue, paper and pens and this will be really useful for us, so I’m very grateful for it. “Sometimes shops I go to have run out of stock and we just don’t have enough to go around. “My  and -year-olds need this kind of equipment more, and we’re really thankful for it.  “My husband is furloughed at the moment and we find out in Aprilhe will go back to work.” Year  key worker and vulnerable children at the school were delighted to get their hands on the delivery. Mid-way through a science lesson Arsenal fan Bradie Adu-Yeboah, , told us: “It’s great because it’s all new.  “I’ll use it for all the work I have to do at home. “I have a colouring book so I will definitely be using the colouring pens.” His classmate Che’nai Quatromini, also , said: “I’m doing a moon project at home but I don’t have enough paper so I can use this for my background.  “I can also colour it in and use it for the moon. It will be really helpful.” This week’s delivery was a sample of what schools will have sent to them. Schools will get vouchers for either £, £, or £,, depending on their need. So far, there are  schools due to receive vouchers. Some £, has so far been raised in addition to the NEU’s £ million donation when we jointly launched the campaign last week.  At Cubitt Town Junior School, which also has an infants’ school attached to it, parents collect packages each Friday to help with home learning. The items bought with the vouchers will help create more packs for the children working from home and for those in need. Ms Bruce said: “The lower down the age groups you go, the more this kind of equipment is needed.  “Having paper, pens, scissors, and glue sticks at home is so important - and people don’t realise that parents sometimes don’t have them. “We had a parent whose child filled their homework in with a felt tip, and we could barely read it. I spoke to them and they did not have a pen at home. “It’s something that is taken for granted. “Of course they need computers and iPads and online learning is important, but it’s deeper than that.  “We’ve got families where there are lots of children in one small place and just feeding them is a struggle - and then we’re asking them to buy pens and paper and glue as well. “That’s why these deliveries will make such a dference and we thank the Mirror and the NEU for all they’re doing. “We also want pupils to have time away from the screen and to be creative. “The ide between those children who are from families which have this equipment and those from families who don’t will continue to grow unless we can ensure they all have the right means to learn.  “So much of our budget is being used to help pupils through the pandemic and there will be all sorts of extras to pay for once they , so these packages help us a lot,” said Ms Bruce. Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the NEU, said: “It is fantastic that Cubitt Town Junior School will benefit from the Help a Child to Learn campaign.

Her observations covered language, food, British politeness - and even the queueing system.British people have rising intonation when they say “bye” on the phone so it’s a bouncy “byYEEE” and why do you people do that, she asked. She also wondered: Please why beans on toast there are so many other lazy foods that are actually good why is this a thing  Jess was also perplexed by fishfinger sandwiches, Brits rushing to rocky beaches and the pronunciation of certain words.  I have been living in the UK for  years this year. Please have a short thread of things that are still weird as hell to me, she wrote on Twitter. People here put fish fingersin sandwiches which is just...why. Britishes pronounce “patronise” pat-row-nize but pronounce “patron” in the expected way and this ergence distresses me. Britishes call their fanciest private schools public schools which is weird and confusing, likely by design.  The thread prompted a lot of engagement, with one follower saying: JESS NO I AM SORRY NO I can get on with the rest of this thread but I cannot believe you are coming for the fish finger butty which is a thing of joy. Jess replied: It makes roughly as much sense as making chicken nugget sandwiches. Iaposm not saying itaposs a bad idea but it is a weird idea.

He decided it was best to head to the hospital and double check, where staff assumed the food he had eaten to celebrate Heatheraposs birthday must be the cause - but an X-ray told a dferent story. It turned out that Brad had unknowingly swallowed the wireless headphone in his sleep and it remained lodged in his oesophagus - which had caused his throat to fill up with water when he had attempted to swallow the liquid.The results of the X-ray showing the AirPod in his chest left medics equally baffled, as Brad, from Massachusetts, explained: It was pretty funny, when she left the room I could hear a bit of chatter outside - aposNo it couldnapost be apos She came back in, looks at me and says aposIaposll be damned, you swallowed itapos.

Her most notorious pen pal is Charles aposTexapos Watson, .He was part of the Charles Manson aposfamilyapos who slaughtered Sharon Tate, the actress we of Roman Polanski and three of her friends at her home above Beverly Hills in . Muriel, from Idaho, USA, started writing to death row inmates during lockdown, after first becoming interested when she was a teen and one of her schoolmates was sentenced to death. She said: When you start writing to them, you donapost expect a lot. When you start getting letters back, you donapost see the monster thataposs portrayed in the news, itaposs like writing to an old friend or someone I could have gone to school with. We talk about everything, they talk to me about being in prison, what itaposs like, their daily routine because thataposs all they have. They donapost have new things and nothing changes for them. I tell them everything Iaposve done that day, what I had at Starbucks, what the weather is like. I send photos of lizards, flowers and cornfields. Those are things that we take for granted and things that they might not have seen for  years. I wrote to Tex because a few people I knew were interested in him and had asked me to because of his involvement with the Sharon Tate murder. Heaposs very polite and nice in his letters. Heaposs trying to get more people to write to prisoners so we have that in common. We just talk about current COVID conditions and how to get others to write to prisoners.  Muriel has built friendships with at least six inmates including Wesley Shermantine, , known as one of the Speed Freak Killers and Sean Ford Jr, , dubbed the Sledgehammer Killer. Ford was given the death penalty in  for slaughtering Margaret and Jeffrey Schobert in April  at their home in Akron, Ohio. Shermantine was convicted of four murders which Calornian authorities said were part of a methamphetamine-fuelled killing spree committed by him and his childhood friend, Loren Herzog, from the s until their arrest in . Muriel said: I decided to write Sean Ford because he went to death row at the age of  and heaposs missed out on a lot of le having gone to prison at such a young age. His crimes are horric and caused a lot of emotional damage. He seems very remorseful for what heaposs done. We started out writing weekly but it slowed down recently because of Covid.  I reached out to Wesley Shermantine because heaposs a serial killer and I’m always curious how these iniduals would respondat all. Would he be interesting or would I even be willing to write backhe did write. He tells me about le in prison and not much more than that. Muriel also struck up a friendship with Frank McCray, , who was convicted of sexually assaulting, beating and strangling a -year-old woman to death in her home in .

The -year-old, from Gold Coast, Australia, was so embarrassed she has vowed to never fly with the airline again. After sharing her story online, Isabelle was bombarded with abuse from haters who claimed she was not entitled to be humiliated because she poses in lingerie and has an OnlyFans account.The abuse became so much that she turned off comments on her Instagram page and told her , followers: There is a massive dference between public humiliation over being fully clothed and being comfortable enough in my own skin to post photos of myself in a bikini lingerie and running a successful business on OnlyFans.Have you had a similar experience recently  Email your story to webnews@mirror. Self-confidence does not mean I am immune to embarrassment, especially at the hands of someone . Isabelle told the Mirror that the she was unfairly attacked on social media.

I was being publicly humiliated at the hands of someone but just because I am confident in myself to show my body on the internet doesn’t mean I’m immune from embarrassment.I am within my rights to wear whatever I want to wear and that really shouldn’t be questioned in . Isabelle said she was given a boost by positive message from people saying they hope their daughters grow up to be as strong as I am and to stand up for themselves in situations like this. Isabelle was boarding a Jetstar flight from Gold Coast to Melbourne on Monday night when she was stopped by a flight attendant and asked to wear a jumper over her crop top. The flight attendant told her You canapost wear a bikini and called over other crew members as they looked for something Isabelle could wear.The flight attendant then ed with a hi-vis vest for the model to wear until she disembarked in Melbourne two hours later. Isabelle, who was travelling with her husband Jeremy Szwarcbord, felt embarrassed and degraded as she wore the vest while walking down the aisle in front of other passengers. She said her crop top wasnapost inappropriate or revealing, and believes she would have been treated dferentlyshe had smaller breasts or was a man. Isabelle said she spoke to eight other Jetstar staff members before boarding and none of them mentioned anything about her clothing being inappropriate. Low-cost airline Jetstar later apologised and said there was a misunderstanding of its policy on the part of the flight attendant. The airline does not have a policy regarding crop tops. Jetstaraposs website states there are minimum dress requirements for its flights and offensive clothing is banned. Isabelle said she appreciates Jetstaraposs underwhelming apology but has no plans to fly with them again. The companyaposs front office told her the flight attendant was acting on non-current policies. She said: I want them to make sure that this kind of situation doesn’t happen again. I don’t want anyone to go through that."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage stowaway miraculously survives 250","story":"NewsTeenage stowaway miraculously survives -mile flight from London to NetherlandsThe boy, , thought to be Kenyan, was found next to a plane which touched down at Maastricht Airport - and could have come all the way from Nairobi via IstanbulmirrorShareCommentsByAnna HighfieldJonathan Coles:,  FEB NewsThe flight departed London Stansted and landed at Maastricht Airport \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

An analysis of options was carried out which considered all the primary schools within the Peterhead area # their suitability, condition, location and roll projections.#A number of questions were asked with one resident asking why money could not be invested in existing sites instead.Maxine Booth, quality improvement manager for learning estates at Aberdeenshire Council, said: #There#s a wider masterplan looking at Peterhead as a whole and what is best required for the community. The aim of this project in particular was to provide signicant educational benefits through the development of a community campus. This includes relocating the academy, primary and a special school. Nursery provision will be provided on the site.#The council has secured funding on the basis of developing a community campus at Kinmundy and is subject to statutory consultation. It#s now seen as best practice across Scotland due to its benefits.#If all of the campus is not delivered, including the merging of the schools, there#s likely to be a signicant impact on the availability of this government funding.#She added: #All schools were considered on their suitability however the ongoing repair and maintenance programme of the school estate will continue. Other investment is currently not available or prioritised for either Dales Park or Meethill Schools. There were some queries raised about Burnhaven considered for the community campus, however, this was not seen as a viable option.#Other residents asked whether children considered living in dferent zones currently registered at the two schools would need to go to classes where.Parents were told that all children at the two schools would move to the new campus.And there was also a query about school transport, but council representatives said it would not be required because pupils would be living within a two-mile radius.Transport is only provided by the council for pupils living further than two miles from their schools.Parents, staff and any other community members were encouraged to ask any questions they had about the scheme.Aberdeenshire Council also recently held a consultation event for the Anna Ritchie School, which could also be moved to the Peterhead Community Campus.The consultation process is due to finish on February .Further comments on the proposal can be emailed to learningestates@aberdeenshire.gov.uk or in writing to Learning Estates, Gordon House, Blackhall Road, Inverurie AB WAAn online survey can also be filled out at: https:tinyurl MergerDalesPark-MeethillFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"gallery aberdeens johnston gardens","story":"This week’s Aberdonian has taken a look back at archive images of Johnston Gardens.With more people walking in the city due to the Covid lockdown, this park has seen its popularity surge in the past  months."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.51188896-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.51188896-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.51188896-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/02/2.51188896-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"return to school expert advice would see many pupils at home until mid april","story":"Many children may notto school until mid-Apriladvice from public health and education experts is followed by the Scottish Government.Gaps of three weeks between pupils#to school have been recommended by the government#s advisory sub-group on education and children#s issues.With nursery, P to P and a limited number of senior phase pupils due back in class on February , that would mean the next group ing on March .

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are # the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the Covid- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 15 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish charities urge government to invest in walking","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

His we Esther also features on the programme.The film takes viewers through the remarkable achievements of the Lighthouse Stevensons over the course of five generations from the late s to the early s.The programme also features Fair Isle South Lighthouse, which was the last in Scotland to be automated in , with interviews from the keepers serving at the time. It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it. For there is always light,only we’re brave enough to see itonly we’re brave enough to BE it.#In the first chapter of his Gospel, John says: #The light continues to shine in the darkness and the darkness has never put it out.#We are called, all of us, to be part of that light and to be bearers of it into a dark and troubled world.

The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.#Now, though, I am hearing from fishing families of long standing, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people in total, thaturgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.#This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single, family-operated vessels, smaller fleets, artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.#As a council, we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.#Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.#We are also speaking with local producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that some of these valuable products reach buyers.#He added: #Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and sped up. These products need to be prioritised over less time sensitive products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.#In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.#I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.#"},{"url":null,"title":"district news february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A new-build, fit-for-purpose hub will be used as a meeting place, a thriving place for all ages, groups and clubs to come together in a stunning environment.SID believes that a community hub will play a pivotal role in the area#s long-term recovery from the pandemic, joining the dots between people that require support – connecting them to a range of services to promote inidual and community wellbeing.SID already has £, secured in match funding from Glenmorangie, the owners of the nearby Ardbeg Distillery. This existing commitment demonstrates the strong private sector partnerships in place and their support for the island#s communities.Hamish Torrie, CSR director from the Glenmorangie Company, said: ‘We, the Glenmorangie Company, have been working for many years on the development of this project with SID and the South Islay community.#We are delighted that SID has secured the funding which will, at last, enable the playing fields project to move to the next stage of its development. The community hub will be vital in sustaining the fabric of south Islay for the future.#SID now needs to secure a further £, in match funding to reach its target to deliver the full project. Part of this will be secured through the launch of a community shares initiative within the coming weeks.This project has been in development for a number of years and is anxiously awaited by the community which has shaped it over the years.Local development officer Alyson MacGillivray said: #SID and the community of South Islay have been on a long journey to get to this point. We are so excited to share this very exciting news with our community, particularly after the challenging  months we have all endured – some positive news is just what the community needs at this time.#SID’s chairman, John Findlay, said: #This is a fantastic project that will benefit not only South Islay but the whole of the island. It will give the community a real boost particularly during these challenging times.#I would like to take this opportunity to thank the SID staff: Alyson MacGillivray, local development officer Bonnie Wood, project manager and Fiona Aitchison, finance and admin officer, for all their hard work on this project and in securing substantial government funding.#My thanks also go to the SID board of directors who, through their voluntary roles, have supported the staff every step of the way.#Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council and councillor for the Kintyre and the Islands ward, said: #This is tremendous news for Port Ellen and indeed Islay as a whole. This will be a wonderful and much-needed facility for the island and my thanks to SID for all its hard work thus far.#Fellow Kintyre and the Islands councillor Anne Horn added: #It is fantastic news that SID has been successful in securing a grant from the Scottish Government Regeneration Capital Fund to enable the long-awaited development of the pavilion into a community hub.#This will be a fantastic asset for Port Ellen and for the whole island of Islay. Very well done to everyone for their hard work seeing this plan come to fruition.#South Islay Developmenthas been involved in the development of Port Ellen and its surrounding area since .The organisation was originally established to help address some of the long-term employment and poverty issues in the area and has seen signicant success during its time in operation.A range of capital and revenue projects has been undertaken including development of the only filling station in the area, new motorhome pitches and the harbour pontoons and office in conjunction with partners.Fèis Ìle, a week-long celebration of Scotland’s most distillery-packed island with whisky, music, dancing and more, has had to be cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid- pandemic.Organisers had their fingers crossed that it would be possible to hold the  event between May  and June , but that has proved impossible.In a statement, they said: #With deep regret we announce that this year’s festival is cancelled.#Keeping everyone safe is our top priority. Eventravel to Islay is allowed, the ceilidhs, tastings and large events that make the fèis what it is, will not be able to take place.#We also need to allow for the fact that people need to be able to make their plans to travel and stay.#The dates for the  festival are from Friday May  to Saturday June  and, regarding those who already hold tickets, fèis organisers confirmed they will #be in touch soon about refunds, or transferring to #.The statement concluded: #Islay and its businesses would love to welcome you back when restrictions allow.

Seaman, HMS Skye. Five children at home, much older than he appears, likes children, very friendly. Headed for Jamaica. Was a fisherman, now a shoe salesman.#Scored out below the address is another # #No  Roading Place# # which may have been a previous address, as it appears that Douglas visited the Caseys# house twice # once in May  and again in September .#We’d love to find his family,# Gloria told the Courier. #He was married with five children so we’re hopeful there will still be family in the area.‘In , he was headed to Jamaica, where the UK had a Fleet Air Arm base, so that in itself is a signicant part of his history – not everyone went there.#When you read about these men, snippets about their lives and little bits about their personalities, it makes it very personal. They became like members of the Casey family, whose house became like a home from home for them.#They were given an opportunity to get away from the horrors of going back and forth across the Atlantic with the U-boats picking them off.#We’d like to post copies of the photographs, which the families will never have seen before, to the men#s relatives # we don’t ask for any money or anything in .#Gloria can be contacted by email at historiangmw@hotmail"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

John Reid and Alex Harvey judged the tractors.Two pairs of horses competed for the first time since .TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOKinloch Park trees face the chopA number of historic trees in Campbeltown are facing the axe.A recent survey of trees belonging to Argyll and Bute District Council has revealed as many as  are in poor condition and may need to be felled.The sycamores at Kinloch Park are amongst the worst hit. The survey, by a private consultant, revealed  trees were causing concern.A number of trees around Kintyre Park have also been identied as suffering from internal fungal rot. The other  trees causing concern are spread around the town. They include at least two at the council offices in Dell Road. The trees at Kinloch Park have suffered damage to their bark over the years and this is thought to have contributed to the rot.Councillors were expected to meet officials to discuss the situation on Wednesday. Councillor George McMillan told the Courier: ‘It is a great pity about the trees that will have to come down. The trees at Kinloch Park have been there as long as anyone alive can remember.’The council#s policy is to replace any trees which have been felled. Councillor McMillan said he hoped it might be possible to phase the felling over two years.The trees were planted shortly after the park was created in the early s by infilling the shallow mudflats between Campbeltown and Dalintober.FIFTY YEARS AGOQuay mishapWestern Ferries# Campbeltown-Ireland vessel the Sound of Islay was delayed on Monday when a large articulated lorry slipped while being reversed on board.The cabin unit of the lorry, which is owned by local contractor Mr William McMurchy, was hitched to a trailer loaded with timber.

Indeed the #evil# Tories are currently in negotiations with the USA, Australia and New Zealand for trade agreements which again would not have been either allowed or possiblewe had been tied to EU regulations.Had the SNP secured independence, it remains to be seenthe EU would have accepted Scotland into the EU, given the financial deficit it currently endures and continues to do so thanks to the current pandemic.Perhaps I should remind Mr Wilson it is the UK government that has managed to secure Scottish jobs using the furlough scheme and secured Covid- vaccinations for all of the UK which seems to have rattled the EU cage that Mr Wilson also occupies.I do agree with him, however, had Scotland been an independent country then his submission of being linked to Somalia and Kazakhstan would be near the truth.Finally, my suggestion to Scottish fishermen was stated in good faith and a possible way out of problems they are experiencing with the EU at present when there was no need to alter the arrangements in place prior to the UK leaving the EU.Knowing from previous items published by the Courier on behalf of Mr Wilson, this is the only time I intend to respond and will continue to polish my brass neck!The vote to leave the EU took place in June , four and half years ago # four and half years in which to start making plans for changes to counter loss or reduction of the existing market for fish products in Europe.I haven#t read of any such plans but, of course, that will be the fault of Westminster the government there should have found new markets for Scottish fish. Doubtless, the government in Holyrood, that is perpetually demanding more powers be devolved to it, was far too busy organising Indyref to spend time looking after the livelihoods of Scottish fishermen.It was obvious that concessions had to be made by both sides in any trade deal, post-Brexit, and it was inconceivable the EU would accept any deal that totally blocked EU boats from our waters instantly. However, Alan Reid and Ron Wilson, it is not bureaucracy on this side of the Channel that is slowing the movement of goods to Europe # that blame lies entirely with a vindictive EU, determined to punish Britain for having the temerity to leave a failing, despotic authority.Ron Wilson, you claim the time is coming when Scotland will reap the benefits of EU membership. Can you explain to me how a country with a massive deficit, . per cent of GDP before the pandemic hit and astronomical now, can even apply for membership, when to qualy a country has to bring its deficit below three per cent Add to that the fact Nicola Sturgeon has affirmed an independent Scotland will retain the pound sterling as currency and EU rules state that a country in monetary union with another country, outside of the EU, cannot under any circumstances join it.Instead of complaining, give thanks that the people of Scotland are being vaccinated now, not in four months# time at best, had we still been dependent on the EU to supply the vaccines.It is being reported, both by opposition MSPs and the national press, that Scotland#s vaccine strategy is being outpaced and starting to seriously lag behind the other three UK home nations and that the SNP has no desire to convene a vaccination task force nor take up the offer of additional British military personnel, to further assist NHS Scotland.Yet, in this time of national emergency, is it not extraordinary that the SNP, Scotland#s devolved administration, has set up a task force to campaign for independence.Rick Warren wrote in The Purpose-Driven Le: #Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but rather thinking less about yourself.#Can Scotland#s domestic government, the SNP, think less on independence and more on beating Covid- and our schools, hospitals and jobs The bins on Kilkerran Road were not collected on Friday last so I left the bin as it would normally be collected the following morning, even though on a weekend.When midday on Saturday came and went, I checked the council website to find out that a vehicle breakdown was the cause of the non-collection and the bins would be collected when a vehicle was available.I left the bin out fully expecting it not to be collected before Monday. To my amazement, at .pm on Saturday afternoon the #freighter# came trundling along and emptied all the bins along Kilkerran Road.This is truly remarkable to have the bins collected not only on a Saturday afternoon but on a freezing cold day into the bargain.These council employees on bin collection, grounds and gardens maintenance deserve every praise and thanks that we the public can bestow.These are the front-line people who keep our town clean and tidy, cemeteries in prime condition and they are often taken for granted.Next time you see them, take a minute to say thanks. They deserve it and more.I have been visited by a Gigha milk #fairy# # or should it be brownie I have been the very appreciative recipient of a large bottle of delicious Wee Isle Dairy milk on a number of occasions. It has appeared asby magic on my back door step.I would love to be able to say thank you to the kind person who has thought of me at this time of lockdown and shielding # thank you Gigha milk fairy, you’ve made me smile!"},{"url":null,"title":"loris lockdown campaign against litter louts","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are delivering the vaccination across a large and challenging geography, during winter, while simultaneously coordinating iable supply of vaccine products.#The challenge really cannot be underestimated but it is thanks to all the staff involved with this programme and the tremendous effort they have put in that we have been able to deliver the vaccine to, as it stands now,  per cent of our population.#Given our remote and rural geography, the majority of the delivery of vaccine to the public will be coordinated by our GP practices, which are ideally located and experienced to do this, given they support our flu delivery programme so well every year. We will, along with Highland and Argyll and Bute councils, provide any additional resources and support that they need to do this successfully.#For our staff in more remote and rural areas, the vaccination is being coordinated by local teams. In Inverness, we are currently using the Centre for Health Science as a location for larger scale delivery.#Dr Davidson explained that one particular challenge was the contact and scheduling of non-NHS frontline staff for vaccination. NHS Highland has a dedicated team in place to support this in the south and mid areas of Highland where the number is largest.He said: #Feedback from colleagues, both those who are vaccinating and those who have been vaccinated, has been positive. We’re also hearing good feedback from those who have been vaccinated by our colleagues in general practice.#We know everyone will be keen to get their vaccine as quickly as possible but would ask that you all please be patient.#We are working our way through the priority groups and you will be asked to attend for your vaccine by your GP practice when it is time for your vaccine. Please don’t call them, they will contact you directly for your appointment.#Dr Davidson added: #Delivery of the vaccine has been exciting to see but it is important to remember that this is only one part of how we can win this fight against Covid-.#Protection for an inidual following vaccination may take weeks to develop and the extent to which vaccination prevents spread of Covid is still unclear. That is why it is so important that, as well as taking up the opportunity to get vaccinated when you are contacted, that we still continue to follow the guidance on how you can keep yourself and others safe.#Please follow FACTS: wear a face covering, avoid crowded areas, clean surfaces, keep a two metre distance and, what I would really like to stress, the importance of self-isolating and booking a testyou have symptoms.#"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In winter, there is the prickly holly bush. Another evergreen is a camellia whose leaves have a shiny, smooth surface and, of course, there is rosemary with its stems of small, slender, fragrant leaves so valued as a herb in the kitchen.Perhaps leaves are like people. We can sometimes encounter some prickly characters who leave us taken aback and hurt by their harsh words.On the other hand, some people have a gt for smoothing out dficult situations and whose personalities just seem to shine.Then there are people who at first sight seem insignicant but on getting to know them bring fragrance and blessing.Soeverything in the garden is going to be lovely, we need to learn to respect each other and realise we are all dferent, dferent in beliefs, colour, personalities and political convictions.Former Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks described that respect as #the dignity of dference#. All major religions teach the importance of understanding one another and practising tolerance of dferent views.Christianity’s great exponent St Paul gave us this advice: #Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one anotherany of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.

animalsrsquo excrement was also creating a slip hazard on the footpath.Now, a political party and a bird control expert have called on the local authority to look again at the options available.Among those calling for a rethink is the Animal Welfare Party.Kay Hamilton, Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, is a member of AWP and said: ldquoThe birds certainly shouldnrsquot be killed.ldquoThis is ridiculous

birds, which could then lead to legal issues.Mr Merchant, who previously lived in East Lothian and operates his business from Cambridgeshire, said: ldquoThe very best thing you can do is mesh above the pavement area.ldquoYou completely mesh above the pavement area so you are excluding the birds from either side but leaving the central reservation open.ldquoThat means that the cost of the netting

project is an opportunity to turn an existing unattractive commercial site into a carefully considered and attractive new residential development.Thirty-six one and two-bedroom flats would be created in a .-storey block facing Olive Bank Road.Two smaller two-storey blocks on Campie Road would provide eight two-bedroom cottage flats.A shared surface road would provide access to residentsrsquo

What exactly is a hybrid Essentially, a hybrid is a combination of a traditional petrol or diesel engine and an electric motor with batteries. By mating the two together, it allows less strain to be put on the engine, which in turn means it canbetter levels of efficiency.Certain models also bring a solely electric range, which allows the vehicle to move without using the engine ndash only the electric batteries and motor.. Ive seen a lot about self-charging hybrids ndash what are these The term self-charging hybrids is used by many manufacturers to describe cars which cannot be charged by plugging them into the mains. As such, these cars rely on the engine to provide energy for the batteries. The batteries are also topped up when slowing down through a process known as regenerative braking.Cars like the Toyota Yaris and Honda CR-V Hybrid qualy as self-charging. They cant offer the same electric-only range as plug-in iants but do help tobetter efficiency over conventional petrol or diesel.. So how does a plug-in hybrid dfer Plug-in hybrids offer the ability to top-up the batteries by, as the name suggests, plugging them in. This can be done via a three-pin socket at home, or through a wallbox installed outside your home. They can also be charged at public charging points should you need to.The added benefit of a plug-in hybrid or PHEV is that they offer a far greater electric range than a standard hybrid. Cars like the BMW X xDrivee, for instance, can travel for up to  miles on electric power alone.. But whats the benefit of switching to one If youre looking to lower fuel usage and pay less in tax, then a hybrid makes a great deal of sense. Many PHEVs, for instance, willmore than mpg when fully charged. When coupled with a fully electric range, it means thatyoure often travelling shorter distances then youre unlikely to need the assistance of the petrol engine all that often.Youll be able to charge the batteries at home or via a public charger and then travel using electricity for shorter trips. Of course, over long distances youll have to revert to combustion power, but around town and for smaller journeys itll make a big dference.. What about for business car users Its those people who require a company car who will see the biggest benefits. Because of the low emissions, many hybrids incur a lower rate of company car tax. The Skoda Octavia, for instance, would incur a % BIK percentage charge for the .-litre TSI SE model. Make the switch to the plug-in hybrid, and the BIK rate drops to %. The savings are there to be made, thats for sure.. But is a hybrid a worthwhile switch for all drivers Not necessarily. You need to think carefully about the type of driving that you do. Of course, under the current circumstances were all staying at home more than usual, but under normal conditions, the type of trips you conduct will have a big effect on whether or not a hybrid is worthwhile.If you do longer journeys, for instance, then traditional petrol or diesel might still make more sense. As weve said, hybrids are at their best with full batteries ndash and once the batteries are depleted of charge, they simply arent as efficient. Soyoure doing frequent long-distance drives which would quickly drain a battery, then a traditionally-powered car might still be the best choice.However,youre only doing shorter journeys, then a hybrid could make a great deal of sense. If, for instance, youre only doing around - miles of driving a day, then these could be conducted using electric power alone. You then have the safety net of a petrol or diesel engine should you want to go further afield. Charge at home and youll quickly see fuel savings."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12279676.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-deniers-dont-believe-covid-exists-sorry-gone-mad","story":"For many of us, braced for the next update on the death toll or front line report from an intensive care unit, it is inconceivable that people can think the pandemic is made up or exaggerated. How can anyone doubt the threat this poses, and go around feeling insouciant and safe  At a time when every shop door handle holds the menace of a grenade, such an outlook is unfathomable.Yet it is not as uncommon as you might think. Nor is it linked to intelligence or education, or lack thereof. For whatever reason, baffling though it is to those of us who trust reliable sources of information, there are countless iniduals who are adamant that Covid is either a hoax, a conspiracy, or a fuss about nothing and that the vaccines are intended to wipe us out. Behind all this lie malevolent manipulators, intent on...well, quite what they hope to achieve by terrying or killing us off remains unclear, but the fear remains potent.Astonishingly, not all Covid naysayers come to their senses when they fall victim. Last autumn, as cases in the US soared, there were reports of victims gasping for air in the emergency room, yet still insisting that Covid was fake. That really does take the breath away. ROSEMARY: In praise of JennersSomehow, though, it feels worse that anyone here could also deny it. It is not aswe live in a chaotic or rogue state, where we have been deluged in unchallenged propaganda or starved of reliable information. Nor is that information dficult to access. Indeed, one of the most miserable aspects of the past year has been the dogged coverage of escalating tragedy: footage of mortuaries filled with the dead, of serried ranks of coffins in funeral homes, of the mortally ill saying goodbye to their loved ones from behind oxygen masks.Do Covid deniers never watch, listen or read the news, or do they tune in only to what they want to believe  Certainly, down the rabbit holes of social media it is possible to find yourself in a netherworld, so far from reality you could be a character Alice in Wonderland. Except that Alice kept her wits about her, and never lost her grip on sanity.Alarmingly, as is becoming clear, the pandemic is only the latest of the fault lines opening up between people whose world views lie at opposite ends of a spectrum. We can mock thwarted Trump voters who continue to believe that the election was rigged, despite not an iota of evidence to support that conclusion. Unlike Covid, where the facts are omnipresent, the US election result has been contested without any foothold in reality. Believing the Democrats cheated says more about protestersrsquo state of mind than about what the ballot boxes contained.And yet, their certainty and grievance are real therersquos no denying that. Nor is any of us entirely immune to being manipulated by tricks or lies. You can point to the Brexiteer threats of a tsunami of immigrationwe stayed in the EU as an egregious hood, but many of those who swallowed it whole were already at a point where it merely bolstered their convictions, rather than shaped them.When it comes to medical denial, there is a long and sorry history of refusniks. Just think of John Gummer, obliging his daughter to eat a beef burger on camera to show that there was no danger of Mad Cow Disease . The government similarly played down the dangers of contracting salmonella from eggs, until Edwina Currie spoke up.The more facts and figures we are bombarded with, in our never-sleeping news cycle, the trickier it becomes to find a reasonable position between unquestioning credulity and healthy scepticism. For years it was possible to be a climate change denier, and remain intellectually credible. Now, yoursquore considered nuttyyou still donrsquot get it.What is troubling about those who refuse to believe what is happening around them, despite the evidence of their own eyes, is that it doesnrsquot make sense. It suggests wholesale disparagement, mistrust or terror of those who run the country, a determination to find hidden and sinister motives behind every announcement and regulation.Some deniers, doubtless, have no guiding principles or cosmology whatsoever, and simply prefer to ignore the wider world beyond their walls. In general, though, the level of suspicion and the passion with which untenable beliefs are held are motivated by something far stronger than lack of engagement. Discrediting Covid even when it has you in its grip denouncing global warming, despite the wildfire sweeping over your house, suggest advanced paranoia and a sense of persecution. ROSEMARY: In the footsteps of medievel pilgrimsNor is such an outlook entirely unreasonable at all times. Leadership in many countries is at worst despotic, and at the best, frequently mendacious, opaque, contradictory and evasive. Traditional media outlets deliver news that is properly researched and sourced, yet often biased in tone or emphasis. And the web is awash not just with documented fact but with misinformation that goes largely unchallenged.The fact that anyone can seriously and sustainedly deny Covidrsquos existence is merely the tip of an iceberg wersquove been trying to ignore. It is a shocking demonstration of a breakdown in societal trust and cohesion. When people refuse to acknowledge reality, and choose instead to believe what they want to believe, facts, truth, testimonies, photographic or recorded proof are cast aside as irrelevant.Despite the decline in religion in the West, maybe there is an ongoing hunger to put faith in the unprovable and intangible, an urge for creeds and a community of the likeminded based on unveriable feelings and imaginary connections.

Its asTony Blair had sacked Gordon Brown in . It has brought to a head three isions which have shattered the unity of the Scottish National Party: the Salmond affair, the transphobia row and the lack of progress toward independence.Ms Cherry had called for Alex Salmond to be readmitted to the party after he was acquitted of all sex harassment charges last year. This did not endear her to the party leader. Next week, Mr Salmond is scheduled to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry investigating how the Government came to lose a total of pound, fighting a doomed defence against his judicial review in . There has been a clearing of the decks in advance of this appearance, in which the former leader is expected to blow open the conspiracy he claims led to his downfall.Read more: The jury found him innocent but Alex Salmond is still on trialMs Cherry has also been an inconveniently outspoken supporter of womens rights. Indeed, she may be the first senior politician to be sacked for believing that a woman is an adult human female. She is a lesbian and a feminist who does not accept that womens sex-based rights should be sacriced on the alter of an ideology which denies that sex is binary. In short, she does not believe ldquotranswomen ARE women. For months, Ms Cherry has been the target of vilication, abuse and even death threats from numerous trans activists in and out of the party.This is such an arcane issue, baffling to the vast majority of Scottish voters, that it seems hard to believe it could have come to this. But Nicola Sturgeon has staked her reputation on driving through a new Gender Recognition Act which will allow men to self-identy, legally, as women merely by making a declaration to that effect. Last week the First Minister made a thinly-veiled attack on Ms Cherry in a video accusing her own party of transphobia. Yesterday, amendments to the much-criticised Hate Crime Bill that would have protected ldquogender-critical women like Ms Cherry from prosecution for ldquostirring up hatred were suddenly withdrawn by the Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf.The key amendment gave freedom of speech protection to ldquodiscussion, criticism or rejection of concepts or beliefs relating to transgender identity. It also protected ldquostating that there are only two sexes and using the words ldquoman and ldquowoman to define a persons sex. The deletion of these amendments could mean that women who object to the presence of natal men in their changing rooms, or in womens sporting events, may in future be committing a criminal offence.The SNP NEC has been trying to enforce a new definition of transphobia in which even the phrase ldquoadult human female would itself be regarded as hate speech. However, it is also the dictionary definition of a woman, andquoting it is to be regarded as transphobia then there might have to be a bonfire of biology textbooks. Universities could have trouble teaching medical students about binary human reproduction.Read more: Dont tell women what makes a woman: they were born that wayMs Cherry is an experienced advocate and the best legal mind in the SNP. She took Boris Johnson to the Supreme Court in  over his prorogation of Parliament and won. In recent months she had been advocating a legal route to independence through court action on Indyref. This is a route which Ms Sturgeon has reportedly endorsed herself. So it might seem perverse to dispense with the services of the only figure in the party with the legal expertise to prosecute it. But in the SNP right now legal expertise appears to be regarded as a threat.These issues have been boiling and roiling beneath the surface of SNP politics for the last two years. The waves of scandal have been lapping around Ms Sturgeons ankles as she tries to deal with the pandemic. Now, rather like Chairman Mao in , she has decided to deal with troublesome opposition by launching a purge, and giving a green light to trans activists in her youth wing, who are highly organised on social media.There is a generational ide in the SNP. Many younger nationalists are zealous advocates of identity politics. Older, analogue politicians, like the former Justice Secretary, Kenny MacAskill tend to side with Mr Salmond and Ms Cherry. The influential Wings Over Scotland blog, penned by the Rev Stuart Campbell, which was essential reading for independence supporters in , is now calling for the resignation of Ms Sturgeon and the ldquowoke legions who are her new praetorian guard.Wings has been assisting the former British diplomat, Craig Murray, in his attempts to disclose details of the alleged conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Mr Murray is in turn defending himself against contempt of court charges relating to the Salmond trial. Another prolic SNP blogger, James Kelly of Scotland Goes Pop, has called on Mr Salmond to launch a new independence party.Like most SNP intellectuals, Mr Kelly had been arguing that it would be senseless to promote ision on the eve of a crucial election which could trigger independence. The SNP lead in the polls indicates a landslide in May. However, he now believes the situation is so dire that the two wings ndash no pun intended ndash can no longer coexist.The truth is that many in the party no longer believe that Ms Sturgeon is serious about delivering independence ndash at least not in any timescale they would regard as acceptable. Thousands have reportedly left in disgust. Ms Sturgeon dominates Scottish opinion polls and the opposition parties are disarray. Her biggest political threat now comes from within her own party.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

First: the expertsare going to be subject to what is now known as The Govian Response, or ldquoWhat do experts know anyway  The report will also be subject to the Look Over There! Response, which involves ignoring the central conclusions by talking about something  instead.This, in effect, is what Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Economy Secretary, did when she was presented with the findings. ldquoAs an independent member of the EU, she said, ldquofree from the damage of Brexit, Scotland would be part of the huge single market, which is seven times the size of the UK.But that completely ignores what the LSE report actually said ndash what they call the independence paradox. No one denies that Scotland,it rejoined the EU, would be part of a huge single market, but what Ms Hyslop ignores is that the EU is a much less important trade partner for Scotland than the rest of the UK and would remain so for a long time to come, even after rejoining the EU. MARK SMITH: The dilemma every unionist is about to encounterIt is this fact that sets up the paradox. Yes, rejoining the EU as an independent country would boost trade with the EU, but it would also lead to an increase in trade costs with the rest of the UK. What this means is that, in order for Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence would have to destroy a sufficiently large share of our trade with the rest of the UK to make the EU Scotlandrsquos most important partner. This is the paradox: for joining the EU to be economically desirable, independence would have to damage our current economy.Sadly, a lot of that would happen naturally, which is the other part of the report that jumps out at you. When neighbouring countries, or regions, or countries in a close union, set up borders between each other, trade between the two starts to decline big time and this is what would inevitably happen to Scotland for reasons that arenrsquot just economic. Look at this bit of the report: ldquoborder costs result not only from economic policies, such as tarfs, but also from cultural and social dferences between nations that reduce the effectiveness of international communication or lead consumers to prefer domestically produced goods and services. MARK SMITH:Why support for independence is up hellip and the three groups of voters who are still resistant to YesThe logic of that is undeniable ndash you put up a fence, itrsquos harder to talk to the guy on the other side and miscommunication develops. The bit about consumers preferring domestically produced goods and services is also disturbing, isnrsquot it  I can see it now: ldquoBuy Scottish! ldquoBuy English! And the English would have much less to lose ndash trade between RUK and Scotland accounts for .% of RUK output compared to % of Scottish output.The SNP would saythat the lost trade with the rest of the UK would be made up by increased trade with the EU ndash just as Brexiteers said lost trade with Europe would be made up by trade with the rest of the world. But the LSE report makes the reality of that clear: the rest of the UK would remain our biggest trading partner for a long time to come, except that, under independence, the trade would be in terminal decline.In a way, I think thatrsquos the hidden sadness of this new report. No doubt, some of the economic damage of independence would be countered by increased trade with the EU, but those cultural, social and personal dferences the report mentions are a dferent matter altogether.

The Scottish Governments annual GERS figures show a huge pound billion hole in the Scottish Governments annual budget. These findings are not surprising: while it is always possible to find an economist or two to support the nationalist cause, the vast majority of respected economic opinion holds that independence would be a disaster.Independence is a low priority for Scots, ranking below health, education, poverty, the cost of living and the economy in recent polls.

Real incomes in the UK have been flat for decades, a reason Scotland needs independence so it can control the economic levers and craft tax and spending policies to attract investment, grow and share prosperity more widely.Fourth, Scottish economic growth as part of the UK has been half that of similarly-sized EU countries. More than  EU countries with smaller populations than Scotland have higher incomes, pensions, le expectancy and less poverty and inequality than the UK, but none has our abundance of natural wealth.Finally,Scotland is so poor, rUK should want us gone.

Not the vital win in a relegation battle or the wonderful team goal scored by Christopher Long, but the boot in the coupon that went unpunished.There are many truths to be garnered from this exchange. Firstly, in case my old man is reading, that of course Motherwell were robbed and it is indeed an egregious scandal. Secondly, fans still love above all  to have a right good moan about referees. And finally, that perhaps the standard of officiating in this country could do with a bit of attention.What certainly cannot be drawn from the incident is irrevocable proof that Robertson somehow has it in for Motherwell. And yet, had this incident occurred in a game involving either Celtic and Rangers, there are those who would have taken it as yet another example of institutional bias against their club from the officials, even had their own team not been involved in the game.Which brings us back to the Roofe flashpoint at Ibrox. There is a debate to be had over whether so much is made of such incidents because of the mediarsquos post-match focus on them, or whether the media focus on them because thatrsquos what the majority of fans will be talking about.Irsquom leaning towards the latter these days, as enhanced, slow-motion videos of Roofersquos tackle were plastered all over social media long before either manager had set foot in the press room. To get their tuppence-worth is only natural.Particularly in these times when fans canrsquot be at matches, the online bun-fight has replaced the post-match pint as a forum to air these grievances against officials, and it is hard not to feel at least a modicum of sympathy for referees when their every decision is scrutinised in such meticulous fashion.And for every stamp by Alfredo Morelos that goes unpunished, there is an elbow from Scott Brown that did too. For a group of supporters whose majority opinion appears to be against the introduction of VAR here after seeing what it takes away from the game down south, Scottish fans donrsquot half spend a lot of time poring over footage and highlighting whichever incidents serve to suit their own agendas.For what itrsquos worth, my opinion is that Roofe should have seen red. But then, I was able to see the tackle slowed down from three angles just by opening up Twitter, unlike referee David Munro. There didnrsquot seem to be much intent, but he does lose control and could have had no arguments had the colour of the card been dferent.Within minutes though social media was awash - with Celtic fans, in the main - demanding retrospective action and holding the video up as proof of how officials favour Rangers over them. Conveniently forgetting of course that their own team had benefitted from a couple of dubious decisions the previous night against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, as Albian Ajeti went down like a Polaris under the slightest of attention from Killie lsquokeeper Colin Doyle to win a penalty, and Odsonne Edouard tucking away their third goal from an offside position. Ajeti, indeed, has been retrospectively charged for simulation, though Celtic plan to appeal.Fans of non-Old Firm clubs have been incredulous for years that either side of the Glasgow ide could feel hard done by when it comes to refereeing decisions, while fans of either Glasgow side are convinced they get the ndash to crudely crowbar in the word of the week again ndash jobby-covered end of the stick. Every supporter in the country could reel you off numerous occasions where decisions have gone against their team, it doesnrsquot mean there is some sort of conspiracy at play.The truth is that referees are human. They have never been under more scrutiny, and a decent case could be made that a few among their number are not quite up to scratch.The question that should be asked though is how we go about supporting those officials to improve, rather than questioning their professional integrity. Indeed, while the motives of Rangers manager Steven Gerrard may have been to protect his own player when he mentioned his desire for consistency from officials and the disciplinary process recently, surely consistency is indeed what every fan wants to see from referees.So no, John Beaton isnrsquot in the Crown Bar yucking it up about how much hersquos diddled Celtic over the years, and Willie Collum isnrsquot regaling his class with tales of sticking it to Rangers.Mistakes will always be made of course, but we should be investing in our referees to ensure that these instances become fewer and farther between.

Scottish Liberal Democrats will oppose any efforts by the Scottish Government to cut support to the media industry at a time when the public need the truth more than ever.John McLellan, director of the Scottish Newspaper Society, said: ldquoIt is very disappointing to say the least that the Scottish Government is singling out news publishing for the withdrawal of emergency business rates relief, a vital financial support agreed by the Scottish Parliament, when the Pandemic is far from over. This is in sharp contrast with the Northern Ireland government which has just extended rates relief for its news publishers.ldquoFurther, the Scottish Government has not renewed its commitment to invest in news publishing to communicate important public information about its Pandemic response and its vaccine roll-out, at a time when private sector advertising in Scotland has collapsed because of lockdown.ldquoThere is no doubt this creates an immediate crisis for Scottish journalism, andthese decisions are not reconsidered, it could leave Scotland as one of the few,not the only, democratic European nations to effectively abandon independent news publishing. ldquoA Government spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Government has invested poundm in the Scottish newspaper industry through increased advertising over the course of the pandemic.ldquoWe continue to value high-quality journalism and have established a short-le working group to consider how to support public interest journalism.

Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, has insisted she would not apologise for prioritising vulnerable groups, telling MSPs earlier this week that % of elderly care home residents had received their jag.On Thursday, Downing Street, quizzed about the timescale of the UKwide rollout, repeatedly declined to define when spring would end during a briefing for journalists the season ends with the summer solstice on June .However, this morning, the Cabinet Office announced the Government intended to vaccinate all of the first nine cohorts by May.It explained: ldquoThe UKrsquos vaccination programme is planned to have reached all nine priority cohorts by May, meaning the Government can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence and maintain the choice for voters between voting in person or remotely.However, two hours later Boris Johnsonrsquos spokesman repeatedly refused to agree the May timescale put out by the Cabinet Office, insisting the commitment was to have offered vaccinations to all those in the first nine cohorts by ldquothe spring and that further details would be set out in the mid-February review.When the spokesman was pressed on why the Cabinet Office knew when spring was but Downing St did not, he replied: ldquoThe press notice was issued in error and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this. As we have previously set out, our ambition is to offer all priority cohorts vaccination by spring and that remains our position.Later during a daily briefing with journalists when it was pointed out that the Cabinet Officersquos erroneous announcement was still online, the spokesman paused and then said: ldquoI was wrong in my initial answer in relation to the Cabinet Office press notice. It isnrsquot actually being withdrawn.Askedit was, therefore, now the case that all nine priority cohorts would be vaccinated by the beginning of May, he replied: ldquoAgain, as the PM has said our priority is to offer all the priority cohorts vaccination by spring. The precise timeline will be set out on February  when the current target of vaccinating groups one to four expires.Pressed that No  was now saying, on the one hand, the Cabinet Office timeline was correct but, on the other, it would not confirm this was the case, the spokesman said: ldquoErm, Irsquom saying, erm, erm, what the PM has repeatedly said, in terms of what the ambition is, erm, erm,

With the route out of the pandemic still far from clear, a little more thought from Ofgem about the impact of these changes on those suffering the worst from fuel poverty would go a long way.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, it’s been particularly dficult for those in the islands given broadband constraints and the fact that more parents are expected to work since we’re in a Level Three area.“While everyone is clearly adapting and doing the best they can, the obvious benefits to young people of being at school, both in terms of their learning and social interactions, cannot be overstated.  Indeed, in her statement to parliament this week, the First insisted the government would use ‘every inch of headroom’ available to them to get children back to school safely.“On that basis, it seems logical to look seriously at the possibility of applying a more localised approach to the reopening of schools.“I appreciate that there will be many factors to be taken into account, but I welcome the Education Secretary’s recognition of the case for a more ‘tailored’ approach, where this can be done safely. I know that discussions with the island authorities are taking place and look forward to seeing what emerges from those discussions over the next week or two.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s a whole chain of businesses in Orkney negatively affected by this.“It beggars belief that, during a pandemic and with an economic recovery effort underway in the islands, our own local authority would bypass Orkney businesses in this way, threatening local jobs in their own community.#What happened to their ‘buy local’ ethos  There’s also the issue of sustainability to think about and the impact of shipping stone all the way from Oban to Orkney, when it’s available right here on our doorstep.#Hard questions need to be asked about how a situation like this could possibly arise, particularly during a pandemic when the economic welfare of our community should be a top priority.“I’m fully aware that, by drawing attention to this issue, I’m probably doing my own business no good at all in terms of future orders from Orkney Islands Council, but this is much, much bigger than Orkney Aggregates.#This is about proper, transparent procedures and the massive, negative impact this questionable decision will have for our community.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More than . million first doses have already been given.According to the Governmentrsquos vaccines delivery plan, some  million people across the UK are estimated to fall into the first nine groups.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time. To that end, the deadlines associated with this have been extended to April  so that the sector has some breathing space. The purpose of the licensing scheme is a set of mandatory standards which apply to all short-term lets and I imagine that the vast majority of hosts already comply with all of these standards – and more.”A working group is currently being established to develop guidance, she said, and there will “definitely be a representative from the BB sector, as well as self-catering to “influence, inform and shape” that guidance.She also maintained that the Scottish BB Association responded to both Scottish Government consultations on the issue, in  and , and were “clear that they were in favour of levelling the playing field between BBs and properties listed on s such as Airbnb.”Ms Forbes added: “In terms of fees, there has been much concern about fees of several thousand points.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/363-Katherine-Dix-Ceit-at-spinning-wheel-outside-Nissen-Cottage-from-Alison-Dix-daughter-via-EM.jpg","title":"traditional journey of the swelling","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSometimes we can follow the journey of a specic story by comparing earlier texts from the great collections of the th century with later recordings, especially those in the School of Scottish Studies archives available online at the digital archive Tobar an Dualchais. We catch characters, plots and inidual episodes changing to reflect new environments, audiences and times as each version is transported by the carrying stream.How a story changes informs us about the people who tell them – their culture, beliefs, and worldview. A setting may be changed to make a story more appealing to a local audience. An episode may be omitted because it isn’t seen to be relevant – or because it is too sensitive. The same story may be repeated because it is an effective warning: be wary of the wilderness lying beyond our township’s boundary.With the help of Tobar an Dualchais, we can follow one story’s journey from Highland moor to the island of Hearmatraigh, near North Uist, in real-time. Folklorists call this kind of story a migratory legend: where the same type of story is told in dferent areas, but with dferent settings and characters, localised where it is told.Catherine Dix, or Ceit an Tàilleir, was a remarkable storyteller who contributed hundreds of items to the School of Scottish Studies Archives. Born in , Ceit spent her early le in Beàrnaraigh, before moving away for work on the mainland at the age of . After a prolonged time away, she ed with her family to the island at the start of World War Two. She was recorded extensively during the s and s.One traditional story features a shepherd and his dog who stay in a shieling overnight. A hag arrives to warm herself by the fire. She swells to the size of a peat-stack, remarking that it’s only her ‘plumage’ rising with the heat. The hag attacks the shepherd but is driven away by the dog. The story is often called ‘m’ iteagan is m’ oiteagan’ : the phrase appears in most iants of this tale.Ceit recorded the story on at least three occasions in  , and with Iain Paterson , himself a native of Beàrnaraigh employed as a collector for the School of Scottish Studies. The  recording is transcribed in the excellent  publication by Ceit’s granddaughter, Alison – Ceit an Tàilleir.Ceit clearly enjoyed telling the story, but during a decade of performances it changed its setting: from a nondescript Highland moor in , to an unnamed island in , and finally to Hearmatraigh in . A story, originally set on the mainland, is gradually reworked by the storyteller, perhaps to make it more appealing to an island audience.It’s in the nature of migratory legends to change – it’s what makes it easier for them to migrate in the first place. But can we also trace where the story came from  Where did Ceit first hear her story: in Beàrnaraigh, or where Folklore recorders are trained to ask about where tradition comes from. At the end of every story, Iain Paterson would ask Ceit where she heard the story. In , she mentioned her father, Archibald Macleodfrom Baile Mhàrtainn in North Uist. But in the  recording she offered an extra explanation: the story in fact came from Archie MacColl of Ardtur in Appin, where she worked on a farm between the ages of  and  years. Paterson, clearly intrigued, asks how the story came to be set in Hearmatraigh. Ceit replied that Archie MacColl had heard the story from a boy from the Outer Hebrides who was working for him.It’s interesting that Ceit maintained here that the story was set in Hearmatraigh in both versions she heard – the one from her father and the one she heard as a teenager working in Appin. In her first recording she had set the tale in the Highlands.By comparing this story and its episodes to similar ‘migratory legends’, we can try to trace how it might have spread. The villain of Ceit’s story is the ‘swelling hag’. This redoubtable character is met with in a type of traditional story that once was told across Eurasia. It is known by folklorists as ‘The Two Brothers’.In the Scottish Gàidhealtachd, we have a version of ‘The Two Brothers’ recorded in Beàrnaraigh. It is called ‘Cailleach na Riobaig’and was collected in  for John Francis Campbell’s ‘Popular Tales of the West Highlands’ project. Despite similar wording between the two tales, Ceit’s story contains episodes not present in the  tale, episodes resembling other versions of the story collected on the mainland, east of Appin.On the whole, Ceit’s story is more similar to these mainland versions than anything recorded in the Outer Hebrides. Although she told Iain Paterson in  that both versions of the story she had heard were set in Hearmatraigh, it may be that, to make the story more attractive to an island audience, Ceit deliberately relocated an originally mainland story to the Sound of Harris. This comes through in the changing setting of her three versions of the story.But why Hearmatraigh  In relocating her story, Ceit chose a location which preserved the kind of setting in the original mainland story. She keeps the shieling, an outpost of civilisation in the wilderness where many stories tell of conflicts between human society and the supernatural.Hearmatraigh might have been chosen as it was one of the principal islands where Beàrnaraigh folk would stay in shielings for short periods to hunt, fish, and harvest peat. One recording on Tobar an Dualchaisnotes that the bothy on Hearmatraigh was built using lime-mortar: this construction technique would have made it stand out among other island shielings built of stone and turf.The Hearmatraigh settlement was centred around the natural harbour known as An Acairseid Mhòr.

Skerry Road East, perhaps the least busy road in Northern Ireland, is part of the Dungonnell Trail but it also runs past the evidence of this area’s industrial past.If you’ve ever driven out of Cargan and on towards Cushendall and Waterfoot you will have seen the signs of railway lines in the valley below.The article below, which sets this story in context, first appeared in its entirety in The Glynns Volume and is currently hosted online via the website of the Glens of Antrim Historical Society. It is drawn from the ‘Iron Mines of Glenravel’ by Kevin J. O’Hagan“Within the last two years an extensive and valuable iron mine was discovered at Glenravil about  miles from Ballymena by James Fisher Esq. of Cleggan Lodge near this town and of Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire. Under the energetic management of this enterprising gentleman it was opened about  months ago.”So read the editorial of the Ballymena Observer, Saturday, July th, , commemorating the opening of the first of the Glenravel iron ore mines.Just three weeks earlier Mr. Fisher himself had given an open-air party for about fty gentlemen friends on the mountainside near the mine. It was an unusual repast, but no more unusual than the event it commemorated for here, in one of the bleakest, most barren and out-of-the-way places in the country, rich seams of iron ore had been found and mud-stained miners were raising  tons of top quality ore per week.This situation could hardly have been envisaged a few years earlier, not even by Fisher. Others before him were aware of the existence of iron-bearing rock but failed to exploit it or to locate the richer seams.The first had been Nicholas Crommelin, who, in , in his task of settling the area and building the village which bears his name, found a sample of the ore.He had it analysed by Professor John F. Hodges who found it to contain from  to % peroxide of iron. Crommelin’s enthusiasm got the better of him and he set about building a furnace to smelt the ore using the local peat for firing.He made repeated attempts to smelt the ore and succeeded in obtaining some metallic iron but the dficulties were so great that he abandoned the idea altogether.His furnace still stands near the village of Newtowncrommelin, a monument to his endeavours.Some years later Hodges was again called to examine some specimens in the possession of Edward Benn, the Glenravel landlord.These were obviously much richer specimens than Crommelin’s for Hodges was now convinced that valuable deposits lay hidden in the Glenravel mountains.Benn had his ore smelted by a local smith, John McAlister of Legegrane, who managed to produce a small sample of iron.This was then taken to Rowan’s foundry in Belfast where it was mistakenly identied as having been produced from the best Swedish ore.This was praise indeed but it seems strange that Benn himself took his discovery no further.Perhaps he was deterred by the failure of ious other projects with which he was connected — the distillation of alcohol and the distillation of paraffin — and was reluctant to invest money in any new venture.At any rate, it wasn’t until the arrival of James Fisher on the scene that mining the ore became a serious proposition.Credit for the initiation of the successful exploitation of the mineral wealth of this area is traditionally given to the parish priest of the time, Rev. Wm. John Macauley. He was a keen rambler and interested in geology and he was aware that the home-based linen industry, by which the majority of his parishioners lived, was in decline owing to the rise of the large spinning mills.His parish included the Braid and no doubt because of this he became acquainted with James Fisher who was then residing at Cleggan House, the property of Lord O’Neill.When a parishioner showed Father Macauley a piece of red rock he had found, Mr. Fisher was immediately contacted for Fisher already had mining interests in N. W. England, an iron ore producing region.The pair of them then set off on an exploration trip to Ballynahavla, near Cargan accompanied by two other men, one of whom had found the ore in the first place.They went almost directly to the spot and lting back a piece of overhanging turf discovered a seam two feet thick. They at once proceeded to Glenravel House to see Edward Benn who encouraged them to investigate further and gave Fisher permission to dig for a year at a rent of pound. The stage was thus set for one of the greatest industrial booms of the century which was to last nearly  years.In  Fisher began by outcrop digging or opencast mining at a place known as the Gullets, on the slopes of Slievenanee, and in the first six months was able to ship , tons of ore to England worth about pound per ton. It was not long, however, before he realised that more and better ore lay within the outcrop and he began to drive adits.The first underground mine to be opened was aptly named the Glenravel mine, situated in the townland of Legegrane on the south slope of Slievenanee.This was in January . Soon, other enterprising gentlemen began to take note, among them Silas Evans who laid the foundations of the Antrim Iron Ore Company which quickly took up large parcels of the country.There was a great influx of people into the area and several mining villages sprang up, chief among them Fisherstown, named after James Fisher, but now with the uninteresting name of Cargan.The ordinary farm workers of the area took to the novel type of employment and soon acquired the new skills of mining.Wages of  - per week in  rose in  to  - and  - per week for underground workers and to  - and  - per week for surface workers. By  there were about  men employed directly in the mines and  horses were being used in carting away the ore. To facilitate this Fisher had built his own tramway which ran from the Gullets to Parkmore, a distance of two miles.There was as yet no narrow-gauge railway from Ballymena.Most of the miners were labourers and small farmers and the owner of a small farm could even do part-time work at the mines when farming conditions permitted.This helped to supplement his farm income. This new-found source of wealth led to a rather unruly sort of le and drinking sprees and brawls were common.Fisherstown was so wild that children were not allowed on the street when the miners were in town — a situation more akin to the Wild West in the goldrush days.At the start of mining operations levels were driven generally two or three at a time. A connecting passage was then cut to join these levels together to provide a cir-culation of air to the miners and to disperse explosive fumes.From this stage the mine was extended horizontally generally following the ore seam and this gave rise to the term — the Longwall method — literally along the wall of the passage. As soon as a sound roof was met with, side roads were driven right and left and from these the working areas branched off approximately  yards apart. In these areas the miner excavated the ore with a pick and shovel in a cramped and awkward position lying on his side. He removed the ore and waste rock in a wide circular sweep andthe roof was thought to be unstable or unsafe he left pillars of rock standing to support it. This method of mining was known as the ‘room and pillar’ and many examples of it are still visible today in these mines.Probably early in the process rails were laid into the mine to provide a means of removing the waste rock as well as the ore. For this reason the main adit was driven  feet high by  feet wide to accommodate a double line of rails. Alternatively,a single line was considered sufficient or the level was for ventilation only, e.g. an air drt, it was driven only  feet wide. As the workings progressed the waste rock within the mine was used to block off workings which became exhausted or to support the roof in place of the ore which had been removed.The miners worked on a sht system so that they would not be mining ore all day.This meant that they worked half the day in the mine digging ore and the other half on the surface loading it or doing some other job. They would be replaced at the ore face by other miners who had been on the surface during the morning sht.The hours in the Glenravel mines were  a.m. to  p.m. By the early ’s several mines were being worked — Fisher at Slievenanee, the Crommelin Mining Co. at Tuftarney, the Antrim Iron Ore Co. at Cargan and Dungonnell and Mr. Charles Chambers and the Evisnacrow Iron Co. at Evishnacrow. Mining had also extended to other areas, namely Parkmore, Glenarf, Rathkenny, Carncormick and Broughshane.Up to this time the mines had been worked solely for iron ore. Aluminium was still a virtually unknown commodity and it was only in  that it was realised it could be obtained from bauxite.In fact, these minerals, aluminium and iron, are two of the most common elements of the Earth’s crust between them making up nearly % of the total composition. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the ores of these metals, bauxite and iron ore, formed by the prolonged weathering of basalt lavas, are found side by side in the Antrim hills.It was Professor Hodges again who, probably because of his familiarity with the ores of the district, discovered bauxite in the Cargan Mine in .This discovery added more interest and potential to the mining industry and boosted out-put from the mines for several years. During these years too the narrow-gauge railway had arrived, reaching Cargan in May  and Retreat in October . Branch lines were laid to the ious groups of mines and these facilitated the ore being removed quickly from the mines to Ballymena and thence to Larne for shipment.The Wire Tramway, an overhead bucket system built in  for transporting the ore from Cargan to Red Bay, had come and gone, having been sabotaged on the night of Sunday, July th  and never repaired. Nevertheless, mining then even as today was dependant on an efficient means of getting ore away quickly. The railway encouraged expansion in the mining industry and made the ore more valuable because it was more accessible.However, in the early ’s, due to a slump in the iron industry in Britain and the exhaustion of the better-classores, production started to dwindle. The production of bauxite continued and some mines went over completely to the mining of bauxite e.g. Tuftarney and Evishnacrow mines, the latter being worked up to . Iron ore production carried on at a reduced pace in most of the mines and towards the turn of the century the Crommelin company even opened a series of new mines along the east side of the Skerry Water and two bauxite mines on the west side.In general, however, the number of working adits steadily declined and desperate ef-forts were sometimes called for to prolong mining, e.g. at the Cargan Mine where numerous volcanic dykes displaced the ore seam, the miners had to bore their way through  feet of solid rock in an attempt to locate the seam but had to give up. Three of the five adits were soon to be closed but in , in attempting to reopen one of them, an additional problem was encountered for the mine was by this time flooded.In , a prophetic writer, R. A. Watson, in an article in the Dublin University Magazine, made the comment that it would take some hundreds of years before these ore deposits would become exhausted, but sadly prophesy and actuality are seldom one and the same. All mining enterprises have to be abandoned sooner or later either because the deposits are exhausted or their extraction no longer pays. Mining, therefore, must eventually disappear from any area since it is only a temporary form of occupation. It is a natural progression. It took Nature millions of years to produce these minerals and what the miners removed in a few short decades cannot be replaced.The mines eventually closed and no one is really to blame. Various factors contributed to the decline, one of the main ones being the unfavourable dip of the ore seam which often caused flooding.Fisher’s mines, the original Glenravel Mines closed on --  because the best quality ore had been worked out and the second quality was considered uneconomical to work. Adits  and  of the Evisnacrow Mines were last worked on -- and closed because of the company’s inability to work them at a profit.The British Portland Cement Manufacturing Co. took over the bauxite mine here in  but the bauxite proved unsuitable for their purpose and the mine was abandoned on --. The Dungonnell Mines were subject to flooding but they were abandoned in  because of disagreements between the mining company and the leaseholders. The Crommelin Co. too was plagued by flooding problems as well as the ore failing but still managed to excavate an exten-sive series of workings at Skerry East, many of which are still accessible.Quite apart from these reasons there are three other factors which contributed to the closure of the mines.Firstly, there were no smelters in Co. Antrim and the ore had to be shipped to mainland Britain.Secondly, the quality of the iron ore was not good enough for smelting on its own — it had to be mixed in the furnaces with other richer, imported ores. The bauxite, too, was not entirely suitable for the manufacture of aluminium and only a small proportion was used for this purpose. Imported bauxite was cheaper and more suitable and so the demand for Antrim bauxite declined.Thirdly, the high cost of transport from the mines to the smelters and processing plants left little profit for the mining companies.Although the mining industry in Glenravel appeared to have died prematurely it was not forgotten. With the outbreak of World War Two a new crisis loomed in the shape of U-boats and it became increasingly dficult to obtain foreign bauxite.In  Lord Beaverbrook announced to the nation that there was a scarcity of aluminium, and aluminium was a vital ingredient in the manufacture of war planes.By this time Germany was producing about % more aluminium than the USA because of her control of Aluminium-producing countries. So it was that interest in the Antrim bauxites was rekindled and this led to re-investigation of local reserves. In  new bauxite mines were opened at Newtowncrommelin known as the Skerry Mines.Other abandoned workings were reopened for their bauxite content and many Glenravel miners and sons of miners were recruited to work in the new mines. Many travelled daily to work in the vast labyrinth at Lyle’s Hill, Templepatrick.The Skerry Mines closed early in  and mining as an industry finally ceased on --.

The marriage took place in  at Full Sutton Prison while they were serving terms in separate prisons in England, both convicted of being involved in IRA bombing campaigns on the UK mainland.Mr Kavanagh had also previously served as special adviser to former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.In  he won compensation after losing his role as a special adviser after a bill drafted by TUV leader Jim Allister prevented anyone with a criminal record from holding the position.At the time Mr Kavanagh said the Bill victimised former prisoners, especially members of Sinn Fein.“Twenty years into a peace process and the victimisation goes on and we’re still going to exclude people ” he said.“Exclusion was part of the problem that we had and why we ended up in conflict. Is the message out there, that’s what we’re going back to, exclusion.“I worked in the community and voluntary sector for seven years before coming to the Assembly, working with some of the most deprived communities, trying to help build a better society.“Ex-prisoners are saying to me `why are we being victimised’ ”In making the announcement of new EA membership, the Department of Education said: “Mr Kavanagh brings to the board of the EA experience of communication and influencing skills, developing and maintaining co-operative working relationships within a corporate governance framework and analytical ability and decision making as a school Governor.“He has experience of budgetary management in an organisational environment.“Mr Kavanagh has declared that during the last five years he has undertaken political activity for Sinn Fein and canvassed on behalf of the party, or helped at elections.”TUV leader Jim Allister said the appointment sends a dreadful message to a new generation of children.DUP East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said there would be anger at Sinn Fein’s decision to nominate the convicted bomber.A Sinn Fein spokesperson said: “Paul Kavanagh has a wealth of experience in education, government and policy development.”A spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “Under the Education Act ,  board members are appointed directly by the Department of Education with the remaining  Board members appointed directly by political parties in accordance with the D’Hondt principles.“Under this legislation, political members are not ministerial appointments and as such the Minister and Department have no role in the nomination process.“The Minister is informed by the relevant political party that the member is in post, having confirmed to the Department that they wish to take up office following nomination in accordance with Schedule , Paragraph .”Some parents at Lumen Christi College were angered when Mr Kavanagh was proposed as a member of the Board of Governors at the Londonderry School in , a position he has held for the last nine years.At the time of his appointment to the Board of Governors at Lumen Christie College, Sinn Fein said Mr Kavanagh had made a signicant contribution to his community over many years.“This has included spending over four years as a governor of a local school in Derry,” the party said.“Republican ex-prisoners have played a signicant role in the development of the peace process and in community development work within the areas where they live.“Those involved in this work should be encouraged not demonised.”Two other people were killed by the IRA unit in which Mr Kavanagh was a member.Nora Field and John Breslin were civilians caught up in the explosion at the headquarters of the Irish Guards, in October .Also nominated for EA positions by Sinn Fein were Angela Mervyn, currently employed by the West Belfast Partnership Board in the role of Education Programmes Manager and Frank Maskey, recently retired as Principal of Corpus Christi College.Gillian McGrath, recently retired Director of Education in the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, was nominated by the NI Commission for Catholic Education to represent the interests of trustees of maintained schools.The Board is made up of  members, some nominated by political parties. The EA is responsible for the delivery of education services throughout Northern Ireland.Belfast Top VideosVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadConvicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority SF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub IRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest EducationNI students to get £ Covid- paymentNI student medics to miss out on £k Covid recognition bonus given to health service trainees Dodds to meet Irish education minister over NI students taking part in ErasmusMinister Weir accused of #hissy fit# over Welsh exam board decision affectiing Northern Ireland pupilsLatest from Belfast Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in EnglandMusician ‘thankful’ after £, flute lost on train turns up in pawn shopPound jumps on vaccine news but pushes FTSE downJamaica faces ‘worst ever’ marijuana shortage as farmers struggle with droughtRyan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s takeover of Wrexham gets FCA approval,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Northern Ireland#s decline compared with a % year on year fall across the UK which marked the worst January since .It is now six years since car sales here had signicantly increased - a trend which would hit the second-hand market. He added: The fall in new car sales over the last few years, and particularly last year, will reduce the supply of vehicles into the used car market.  was the last year that NI posted a meaningful increase in new car sales with registrations down % since then. It remains to be seen whether the new car sales market can reverse its recent decline in  and climb the priority spending list for consumers.Karen Johnson, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate Banking, said selling online had not been enough to halt the drop in new registrations.Lessons learned from the first lockdown have seen traders bolstering their e-commerce propositions to meet the changing purchasing habits of the consumer, selling cars via delivery and on a #click and collect# basis, but their valiant efforts fell short last month.As well as a desire to see forecourts reopening sooner rather than later as we move further into , sellers will also be looking to those consumers who have built up savings during the pandemic to start committing again to big ticket purchases like a new car.Although the industry is still producing high quality vehicles and is doing its best to stimulate demand with attractive financing deals, concerns still abound re the infrastructure needed to support dferent fuel types.Ms Johnson said more charge points were needed for a rise in sales of alternatively-fuelled cars.She added: Consumer demand for the next generation of vehicles with low or zero emissions is undoubtedly muted due to the underlying caution around the well-publicised roll out of charging points - particularly in rural areas. Northern Ireland has the lowest number of charging points per capita than any other region in the UK, so it is clear more must be donesales are to gather pace in the next few years.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said it was a bad start to the year for the industry, which lost £.bn in sales last year. He added: The necessary lockdown will challenge society, the economy and our industry#s ability to move quickly towards our ambitious environmental goals.

Now he has decided to tackle the man he considers the greatest to have ever played the game.The book, which has the backing of the Best family, features wide-ranging interviews with George#s loved ones, team-mates and friends.The foreword is provided by George#s brother Ian and brother-in-law Norman McNarry.Much has been written about Best#s rise from the Cregagh estate to the top of the footballing world. The controversial star was followed by the media throughout his le, his every move documented in column inches. Mr Barton said he wanted to get away from the stories of drinking and womanising and concentrate on George Best the footballer. Best died as a result of alcoholism in November . Before his death he asked that people remember me for my football.I#ve talked to so many people while writing my other books, many of them tell stories about George Best, it#s just mesmeric from my point of view, said the author. I#m a United fan, I#ve seen all the tapes and everything of George, and I always felt that George was the best player we#ve ever had.I feltI was going to do something about him I#d have to come up with something dferent than everything that#s been written.I thought the one thing that was missing, as stupid as it sounds, was a book about George the footballer. He said he doesn#t shy away from the negative aspects of George#s le when it pertains to football.They are such prominent things in his le you can#t completely pretend that it doesn#t exist, that wouldn#t do his story justice, he explained.Mr Barton referred to the story of the hotel bellboy who delivered champagne to Best#s room and found him with a scantily-clad Miss World on a bed covered with his winnings from the casino. The bellboy asked Best: #Where did it all go wrong # Mr Barton said it has become a bit of a punch line, but he hopes to understand Best#s mindset.The writer said that during his research he discovered the true story behind the star#s exit from Old Trafford.He left the club in January  amid a turbulent season that saw United relegated just a few years after their  European Cup triumph. Mr Barton used information published in this newspaper at the time to uncover the story. It#s never been documented before, it#s been said he came into the stadium drunk, but I have found a lot of stuff that rubbishes that story and clears George#s name, he said.It#s dficult to say when it#s your own work, but I think it#s the biggest untold story in United history.My motivation was not only to tell the story about George, but make sure that I was being true to him. Rather than just telling a story about a famous player, I wanted to make sure I was being loyal to the way he would have wanted it to be told.With his birthday coming up I imagined the book would be a positive celebration of George#s le, and I think I#ve achieved that.Belfast Top VideosVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority IRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim , doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#Latest Northern IrelandSome port workersto Brexit inspection duties in NIFines for non-essential travel across the border to come into effect next weekSean Graham Bookmaker Massacre survivor Mark Sykes arrested by PSNI during anniversary eventMore than , vaccinated in Northern IrelandGarda set to issue € fines to NI motorists crossing border without #reasonable excuse# Latest from Belfast Republican Greene accuses ‘morons’ who voted to kick her off House committeesSome port workersto Brexit inspection duties in NINew documentary to explore historical abuse allegations against Woody AllenFines for non-essential travel across the border to come into effect next weekRaab criticises Russian expulsion of diplomats after attending Navalny rallies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The information was obtained through a Freedom of Informationrequest by investigative website The Detail.In a statement to the website, the PSNI admitted thatpeople knew the police were treating their social media activity in this way, it could negatively affect their mental and physical health.The PSNI’s Strategic Communication and Engagement Department was asked to produce all social media monitoring reports they had compiled in a one-year period.Hundreds of pages with heavily redacted material was provided - but many were entirely blacked out. Police redacted all posts made by members of the public on social media. The only posts shown were either made by official PSNI social media accounts and occasionally by media outlets or public bodies. The PSNI said it engages in the practice of monitoring and reporting on the public’s social media activity to “measure sentiment in the community”.However, the service also acknowledged that when people “made social media posts which are either critical or supportive of policing they would not expect their social media posts to be gathered as discussion points on PSNI social media reports”.Some examples of the police’s commentary on social media posts included a photojournalist complaining about the number of times he was stopped by police each day for questions, graffiti about Prime Minister Boris Johnson and a tweet from a youth claiming he was attending to attend a bonfire.There were also reports on tweets regarding an incident in the Markets area of Belfast which claimed that police were ignoring certain areas during the pandemic and reaction to a republican activist being stopped and searched by an officer.However, none of the documents included any social media reaction to high profile cases involving the PSNI, such as the death of Noah Donohoe, the funeral of Bobby Storey and the arrests of journalists Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey over their No Stone Unturned Loughinisland documentary.Very few references were made to the PSNI’s handling of the Black Lives Matters protests.The PSNI said in its FoI response that the reason for redacting a large amount of material was that the service has a duty of care to “ensure that the physical and mental health of those iniduals are safeguarded by not releasing any material that could point to the originator of the post”.They added that some of the information could endanger iniduals.The PSNI said it has been monitoring and internally reporting on social media posts since .A PSNI spokesperson stated the purpose of the service’s social media monitoring and internal reporting “is to gain better understanding of community feeling in relation to policing and police activity so that the service can identy issues, concerns and successes to inform, enhance and improve their service”.Belfast Top VideosVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadConvicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority SF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub IRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#, doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated Latest Northern IrelandSean Graham Bookmaker Massacre survivor Mark Sykes arrested by PSNI during anniversary eventMore than , vaccinated in Northern IrelandGarda set to issue € fines to NI motorists crossing border without #reasonable excuse# European Commission exploring ‘flexibilities’ in NI ProtocolFoster thanks #people from all backgrounds across UK# for signing Article  petition as parliamentary debate secured with k signaturesLatest from Belfast Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in EnglandMusician ‘thankful’ after £, flute lost on train turns up in pawn shopPound jumps on vaccine news but pushes FTSE downJamaica faces ‘worst ever’ marijuana shortage as farmers struggle with droughtRyan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s takeover of Wrexham gets FCA approval,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He became the epitome of all that is good and noble about how we have come together in a common cause of defeating Covid and supporting our health service and our health workers, he said.However, a row broke out after Sinn Fein did not pay tribute during a meeting of Fermanagh and Omagh council.The Belfastcontacted Barry McElduff, the party#s group leader on the council, but he refused to comment.It drew criticism from DUP councillor Errol Thompson, who said: Captain Tom was someone who fundraised for our country as a whole and a lot of that funding came towards our own Trusts here. The Western Trust received £, from his efforts and the Southern Trust received £,. What a treasure he was. It is disappointing and I know other people who would call themselves nationalists or republicans actually did pay tribute.He added: They [SF] probably had their own reasons for doing it.During the meeting, Ulster Unionist councillor Victor Warrington said: The man was a great inspiration at the start of this pandemic, with his efforts of doing the walk to raise millions for the NHS. He had a great le of  years and would have had some great stories to tell. On behalf of my party, I want to express our sincere sympathies.This was followed by a tribute from Mr Thompson of the DUP.Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: The money that Captain Sir Tom raised during his activities was absolutely inspiring.Independent councillor Josephine Deehan told members she was greatly saddened.Another independent, Donal O#Cofaigh, referred to Sir Tom#s inspirational efforts.SDLP councillor Paul Blake said he was a real inspiration, adding: We owe a great debt of gratitude.Yesterday, hours before a national clap in his memory took place, the House of Commons fell silent in tribute to Sir Tom.Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the centenarian had dedicated his le to serving the needs of so many others. He said: We all now have the opportunity to show our appreciation for him and all that he stood for and believed in. That is why I encourage everyone to join in a national clap for Captain Tom and all those health workers for whom he raised money at pm this evening. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Captain Tom#s contribution - having raised more than £m for the NHS during the first coronavirus lockdown - will be formally marked, possibly with a statue.Belfast Top VideosVideoWatch: The moment a tractor crashes into Co Fermanagh homeVideoExclusive Belfastpoll: DUP support takes a e in wake of Irish Sea border rowVideoPolice name Cltonville Road murder victim as Danny McCleanMost ReadSF man#s #no comment# on Captain Tom Moore tribute snub Convicted IRA bomber Paul Kavanagh appointed to Education Authority IRA bomber Kavanagh#s Education Authority role beggars belief, says victim , doses of Covid- vaccines lost to wastage ... but almost , inoculated East Belfast show of strength #an attack on the Ogle family#Latest Northern IrelandSome port workersto Brexit inspection duties in NIFines for non-essential travel across the border to come into effect next weekSean Graham Bookmaker Massacre survivor Mark Sykes arrested by PSNI during anniversary eventMore than , vaccinated in Northern IrelandGarda set to issue € fines to NI motorists crossing border without #reasonable excuse# Latest from Belfast Republican Greene accuses ‘morons’ who voted to kick her off House committeesSome port workersto Brexit inspection duties in NINew documentary to explore historical abuse allegations against Woody AllenFines for non-essential travel across the border to come into effect next weekRaab criticises Russian expulsion of diplomats after attending Navalny rallies,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A planning application was previously lodged for the construction of  residential apartments which will comprise of  one bed and  two bed apartments.

If approved, people will be able to gain access to the apartments from Foyle Roadand John Street.  There will also be a ground floor parking area that can accommodate  cars. The accommodation is viewed as a good location for non-car use and car ownership will be being actively discouraged at the site. A Travel Plan will be promoted by a ‘Travel Coordinator’ who will promote other forms of transport. A document accompanying the application, states: “The measures will encourage the use of sustainable modes, reduce dependence on the car and therefore contribute to reduced car growth in car journeys, increase the use of healthier alternatives such as walking and cycling, and contributing towards making a safer, healthier environment around the development.” googletag.cmd.push A report also highlights the servicing arrangements for the building which sits close to the bottom deck of the Craigavon Bridge. It identies the challenges posed by vehicles collecting or delivering goods to the apartments but deems these activities to be ‘low-impact’, aside from removal vehicles, which was categorised as ‘medium impact’ – but something that will happen ‘once a year’. The site was formerly occupied by Hamilton  Sons factory which was demolished in . At the time there were concerns about the stability of the building, which had been derelict for years. Foyle Civic Trust was disappointed by the decision, saying that everything should be done to save the industrial heritage of the city.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Extremely quiet. The other places Ive visited have been quiet, but not to this extent. Just like it takes your eyes a while to adjust to new light,you wait long enough, things come into focus. A Claudy Fuels lorry roars past and when it clears, there is movement. A young boy in Banagher gear emerges from the Spar shop clutching a plastic bag. He hasnt far to go, and with a quick look either way, darts across the road and disappears into a house on Feeny Road. At its heart, Feenys main thoroughfare is a residential street, and the people who live there are staying at home. googletag.cmd.push Walking up the hill towards the GAA pitch, the sun briefly illuminates figures at windows. An elderly man squints against the sun as he peers out his window. I catch glimpses of home-schooled children appearing at the windows as I make my way past. The distinctive air brake of the bin lorry comes at regular intervals. One woman rushes from her house with a bin in tow, spinning it on the kerb before retreating back into her home. Covid- messaging on the gates of Fr McNally Park. Smoke from internal fires wafts through the air as I reach Fr McNally Park, where the sun is breaking through the haze to create a spectacular backdrop. googletag.cmd.push The pitch is the first place of note you reach when you enter Feeny. It acts almost as a gatekeeper for the village, but its own gates are open. There dont appear to be any walkers on the grounds though, and I head back towards the centre of the village, where cars are parked around its hub the pharmacy, supermarket and chippy. A man stops me in the pharmacy car park, askingI know where he can find the boy that does the tarmac – McCloskey. Its as near to the needle in a haystack conundrum as you will find. I wish him luck.     Outside Feeny pharmacy, a makesht shelter has been erected to facilitate a socially distanced queue, but there is none today. Local pharmacist Declan Bateson believes people are taking things seriously. Owner Declan Bateson tells me this lockdown has been much quieter than its predecessors. “After Christmas, its been quieter. People are taking it seriously and have seen the surge in the hospitals,” says the  All-Ireland winner. “In the run-up to Christmas it was very busy. Retail shops were closed for a while and with the pharmacy being allowed to stay open, it meant we were busier. “GPs have tightened up who can come and theyve had a lot less people going through their doors, which means a lot more people coming through ours.” The pharmacy is at the centre of the village, both physically and metaphorically. Although he brushes off the notion of a pastoral role with modesty, its clear this is the case. “With the elderly living alone and feeling a lot more isolated, we are one of their few points of contact,” he says. “We know everybody who comes into the shop, we know their families and we can ask after them. Were part of the community. “We do try and reach out and have those chats, seethey are doing okay, orwere delivering to them we can have a chat on the doorstep and see how theyre keeping. “Its always felt that way though. Its a small village, there are a couple of pubs, a local shop with the post office, ourselves and the doctors. “The pubs have been closed and the doctors have been less available, so ourselves and the shop next door have probably been pivotal in keeping people going.” All over, this lockdown has been very dferent to its initial version last Spring. Covid has come creeping in to the Feeny community like many across Ireland. “We got lucky the first time round, there were no surges here, but in September and October you began to see local people testing positive. Reality dawned on people that this was serious,” he says. “The lockdown before Christmas frustrated a lot of people, but in hindsight it was a mistake to let things open up again in the run-up to Christmas. Its cost lives. “We would have had the odd doubter of Covid coming in during the summer months, but we dont seem to have them coming in any more.” Wise words greet customers at Sizzles in Feeny. Next door, in Sizzles chippy, they are cleaning in preparation for the evenings business. The door is open for ventilation when I askanyone is around to speak. Grainne plays the role of gatekeeper, listening to my reasons for disrupting their Thursday afternoon, before owner Marlene appears from the kitchen, satisfied with my explanation. “There is no fortune being made, but at least were surviving and looking forward to getting back to normal,” she tells me. “You always worry, because you think will this week be okay  Its stressful for anybody, but I feel sorry for people in the restaurant game. “I always want to work, but sometimesthe government says you cant, then you cant. Youre always concerned about your staff and customers.” Marlene echoes Declans analysis of how the virus has crept up on the people of the village. “At the start it didnt really sink in, until people started to get unwell. You just didnt want to see loved ones get taken to hospital and you were watching horror stories on the news of it being fatal,” she says. “The summer was great because you were home early in the evenings and there was nice weather. Its tough now on peoples mental health, trying to stay positive. “Since the schools closed, its hard for childcare as well. It affects the whole community, but keeping going is important.” There is a big push to improve broadband in the area at present. It is clear the business owners in the centre of Feeny feel a wider responsibility than simply providing a service. Marlene says its hard to lt peoples spirits in such emotionally sanitised circumstances. “Everybody expresses theyre fed up, and were all in the one boat, but you cant spend a lot of time because we can only allow one person in at a time,” she said. “It removes that bit of banter between people, but thats the times were in. You still have people who want to come in and stand and you feel bad askingyou can bring it out to them.” “If one of us went down though, thats the whole team down and it has a knock-on effect.” Birds are dancing back and forth across the Feeny Road as I make my way back towards the car. I note the name of the pub – Sperrin View. I take a moment to savour it, looking down Glenedra Road as the sun breaks over the Sperrins. Its a pity no one will be able to experience it for a while. On the way back out the road, I stop off at Banagher Glen, on the off chance any walkers want to share their lockdown experience. Im halfway down the narrow road when Im waved down by two perplexed looking men standing outside a van. “Do you knowThomas Murphys gravel pit is anywhere round here ” asks one of them. I shake my head. Its probably time I went home.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary. The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. googletag.cmd.push “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again.     Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Feacuteile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management,as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over pound, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.  - Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again. Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Féile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management, as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members. We had to try and find as many Irish players as we could and then supplement that by training up non-Irish guys who were interested in playing and try to get them up to speed before the first games of the season which were usually in the first weeks of October. This didn’t give us much time and wasn’t helped by the lack of floodlights on the grass pitches which meant that from October until February most of our training sessions were held on a G pitch with only soccer goals to use for shooting drills. Throughout my time at Stirling, we were lucky to have a good core of Irish players and managed to successfully train up a few from scratch into fairly decent players. Most of the players during my time were from the UK and Ireland but we also had players from Sweden, Spain and even Australia. The league was always dficult to compete in as we were coming up against teams from Glasgow, Edinburgh Aberdeen and Dundee most of whom were able to field teams with at least  or  Irish players. We might have only had six or seven, with the rest made up of players who may have only had a handful of training sessions before being flung in at the deep end so to speak. This meant some one-sided matches at times but the key thing here was to try and make sure the new lads didn’t get too disheartened. The British Championships would have been our main focus each year as we would be playing teams from all over Britain with similar ability to ourselves. In , which was my first time going to the British Championship, we reached the quarter finals where we were beaten by a strong Heriot-Watt team that reached the final that year. The following year in , when I was now President of the club, we were confident of doing well as we had a good squad and had trained hard however fortunes weren’t to be in our favour as due to waterlogged pitches. All  teams in our ision had to play their matches on one already drenched pitch in Leeds. By the time of the fourth game of the day the surface resembled a bog more than a football pitch, games were changed to  minutes straight to try and get the competition finished. Our last game of the competition finished - to -, giving you a taste of the conditions which also meant we would finish second in the group and miss out on the semi-finals. In  in my final year on the team and still president we were determined to go one step further, but a last-minute change of dates meant we wouldn’t be able to send a team that year as everyone had already changed their commitments for the original date which was disappointing personally. Outside of football the British Championship weekends in Manchester were always a great weekends craic and was good for team bonding. The St Patricks Day Festival Cup was a challenge match we played every year against Sands McSwineys Coatbridge who are a club team from just outside Glasgow. Despite the name the cup match has been played anywhere from December to April but was usually played a week or two after St Patricks Day. This was good for us in the committee as it gave us something to keep training for after British championships. The games against Coatbridge were always competitive and occasionally controversial. After two attempts – a defeat and a controversial late abandonment when we were seven or eight points clear - we eventually got our hands on the trophy which was a good experience for some of the lads who were new to the sport. We were able to defend our trophy the following year as well. The social aspect of the club was also very important, having a strong social element allowed the guys who maybe weren’t the best players or couldn’t make training sessions or matches due to other commitments were still very much included in the club. Throughout the year we would hold multiple socials and nights out alongside the ladies team. The All Ireland Final and the Sky GAA TV deal was a major boost for us at the time, because it meant that we would be able to hold the social in Molly Malones Bar in Stirling instead of having to travel to Glasgow or Edinburgh. It quickly became a tradition that every year ourselves and the ladies would watch the game and it was an important social event. It was usually on the weekend after the sports bazaar so it was good for anyone who was joining the team to come along and meet the current team. Through sponsorship agreements with Dusk nightclub in Stirling we were able to help subsidise our travel to matches, referees, equipment and our accommodation for British Championships. One year we managed to raise over £, between ourselves and the ladies team through the sponsorship agreement which was huge for both teams financially. In October , the club’s th Anniversary, we reached out to as many former players as we could contact and invited them to Stirling for a meal in aroom at the event centre of the University. The event was well attended and a number of the former players turned up to support us earlier in the day as we had a home game against Heriot-Watt. It was great to meet former players and hear stories of their time as part of the club. We had been planning to do something along the same lines last October for the th Anniversary, until Covid- scuppered our plans. From humble beginnings and  years later, the GAA roots in Stirling remain. Central to all of that was the Derry influence, as the baton was passed along the line.- Part one of the story of Stirlings Derry roots - Build it and they will come CLICK HERE...\",\"keywords\":\"GAA,Oisin Moran,Derry,StirlingGAA,Scotland,Aaron Conway\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"In part two of our look at the Derry influence on Stirling University, Michael McMullan looked into the experiences of Magherafelt man Oisin Moran and Craigbanes Aaron Conway as they kept the club on track.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

Every four years, the le-cycle of the average course, the committee members will move on. The early years in Stirling, with Magherafelt man Declan Loane founding the club in , were fruitful with the establishment of the clubs sevens tournament. But it needed to have a spine to carry it all the way to the current day. Lisburn man Peter ONeill and Ben McCloskey of Ballinascreen are at the forefront of the club, but passing the baton was the important piece of the puzzle. In Loanes final final year, a new committee was elected to take the club forward and keep the transition smooth, with members having experience in running all aspects of the club. googletag.cmd.push Down man Stephen Gallagher, the team captain, became Chairperson and Gabrielle Dunne , hailing from Strabane, took up the position of Club Secretary. The had time left on their degree courses and their leadership and commitment aided a developing club into a growing entity. The club continued to grow in numbers and grow stronger both on and off the field year on year. Several players, including Stephen, went on to play for Scotland at the British Universities Tournament. And members of the club gained colours for their contribution to sporting le while at University. “Stephen was captain on the field and went on to show these same leadership skills, whilst in the chair,” Declan commented. googletag.cmd.push “Gaby contributed immensely throughout the formative years as well in ious roles within the committee. “Having worked closely with both, I knew the club and the future were in safe dedicated hands,” Loane added. “All university clubs need and rely on a continuation of committed iniduals beyond one degree term, to keep the momentum of any club. With each new academic year, all clubs hope that a committed fresher will come on-board – both on and off the field. In my time, that fresher was Stephen.” It was only the beginning and it wasnt too long before there were Derry fingerprints on the clubs baton again.     Oisin Moran and Aaron Conwaypictured at Freshers Day  in Stirling Magherafelt man Oisin Moran, son of former Derry physio Sean, arrived in Stirling to study Sports and Exercise Science. He was part of a very successful underage team at home, which culminated in winning the  All-Ireland U Feacuteile. On new soil he didnt know anyone and had to build a new friendship network that remains strong to this day. Oisin takes up the story. When I joined the team, there was a mix of Irish and non-Irish players with a  of . As most of the players were in their final year, it created problems when I took over the club the following year. During my first year I learned a lot about the club traditions and values which Declan had cited. The Stirling team did not have a large  of  plus Irish players to choose from like some universities so we had to branch out and attract players from a non GAA background and from dferent parts of the world. A sense of family was soon established, much like clubs at home. We had the opportunity to go down and play in the British Championships in Birmingham, which helped give me an insight to the championship and made me determined to bring the club down every year and to compete against other Universities from Scotland and England. Towards the end of my first year we held our AGM and I put my name forward to be nominated for captain of the team the following year and I was successfully appointed. Odhran Hassan from Banagher was elected president of the club at the same time and we came together at the end of our first year to develop a plan to build and grow the club both on and off the field. I think this is a challenge for most University Clubs as teams have to be rebuilt regularly and it’s an even bigger challenge for teams like ourselves as we don’t get an influx of Irish students every year. At the start of second year, myself and Odhran began the process of rebuilding and quickly started the recruitment process. This included social media posts, putting posters up around the university, handing out flyers. We also had a stall booked for the sports bazaar which is held during Freshers week. Overall our recruitment drive was very successful and we got around  people to join the club. Myself and Odhran ran the club, we trained the team as well as honouring and managing our sponsorship agreements. We arranged referees for games andplaying away would secure transport to and from the venue. We needed good time management,as we were doing this alongside studying for a degree. However I wouldn’t have changed it for the world. Id happily do it again as I was doing the role because I love the sport and wanted to grow and develop the club. At the AGM I stood for the position of President and I was successfully appointed for the - season. As President, I continued to build on the good work myself and Odhran started and continued to expand the clubs numbers and also had the opportunity and resources to attend British Championships again that year. We also combined the women’s Gaelic team onto our sponsorship agreement which helped bring the two clubs closer together. Throughout the year we held joint social events which were great craic and also every week we held a joint training session on a Sundayno league games were being played that weekend just to get everyone together and have a bit of fun playing the sport we all love. Towards the second half of the year I made the decision that I should pass the responsibilities of running the club over to someone  as I was going into my final year and needed to focus on my studies and I knew I couldn’t commit the proper time that was needed to successfully run the team. At this point I could see Aaronwas very committed to the team and could see he shared the same love and enthusiasm for the sport. Maybe it was because we are both from Derry, but I knew the club would be in safe hands so I encouraged him to run for President at the end of year and I would be there in my final year to give him any advice he would need. Overall I’m very proud I had the opportunity to be a part of the club and learn its history and then be able to contribute to maintaining the traditions and club values whilst helping build the club over the years I was attending University in Stirling. If you asked me what was a more important achievement to me gaining a degree or running a Gaelic team it would be the Gaelic team and it wouldn’t even be close. *** Aaron Conways first experience of the Stirling University Gaelic football team was on a Wednesday afternoon, in September , at the sports bazaar. Having moved over from Derry, without knowing anyone beforehand, he figured it would be a good way to settle in and make friends. He takes up the story. I had just put my name down for trials for the soccer team when I overheard a thick Irish accent say ah lads Mayo have no chance against Dublin on Sunday, I looked over to see a guy in a Roscommon jersey sat at a table with a tricolour hung in the background. As I walked over, I saw a sign which read Men’s Gaelic Football and a laptop on the table which was showing the  All Ireland Football Final. As I approached the table, a guy in a Derry jersey introduced himself as Odhran and askedI was interested in joining the team. We chatted for a few minutes and I gave him my contact details and that was it. For me this was better than expected, as I was able to make friends with people from home and to have the chance to start playing Gaelic football again as I had stopped playing for Craigbane at U level. At the end of my first year, I was voted onto the committee as the social secretary and it was only here where I started to see the work that went on behind the scenes to keep the club running. One of the major challenges which most university sports teams face is the constant turnover of players and members.

This column also feels there would be some mileage in Prentys thoughts, which he said would stop what he called the runaway train that is the inter-county game. While he cites costs as one of his reasons, and it is an issue, I think a more streamlined county scene would allow club and county to dovetail nicely together. googletag.cmd.push Albeit forced on us by Covid-, the split season has already been a great move by fixture chiefs in the association. It enables club and county to have their dedicated piece of the pie, something Shane McGuigan outlined in a recent interview. It allowed players, in his experience, to be fully in the room when the county or club is taking preference. No more would it be a case of just having one eye on the prize at stake. And the club game delivered by the lorry load. It offered a product that the national print and broadcast media embraced. Club players were now front and centre. Just as they should be. googletag.cmd.push On the county scene, we will park the overusedDublin are miles ahead narrative for now. The  season gave us Cavan, a story that so many of us can be inspired by. But with a shortened championship, it allowed us to escape the kerfuffle of the Super s. However, we paid the price with two landslide semi-finals. Tyrone, Donegal, Galway, Cork or Kerry would have added more substance to the last four hands grasping for Sam Maguire. Its up to them to get themselves back out of their province. Until Leinster can get back to the level Dublin are at, we are always going to have a lopsided championship.     Thats why I feel John Prentys thoughts need proper consideration. Its time the GAA took a truthful look in the mirror. And reflect where it will be in five years time. Almost five years ago now, I had a conversation with a club manager. One of those off the record what do you think of the game type of chats. As we tried to put the world to right, he said one thing that summed up our conversation. We agreed that an All-Ireland winning manager lting the lid on his teams path to success, revealing just two collective training sessions per week as the core to their championship fine-tuning would be a game-changer. It wouldnt be long until every manager would follow suit. The sheep mentality in us latches onto winning trends. Kieran Donaghy was in the inter-county wilderness, a midfielder on the fringes of Kerrys starting , until Jack OConnor threw him in at full-forward during a qualier game against Longford. It worked a treat, in that Jack had the players to leave the ball hanging over his head and make him the ideal target-man. Donaghy became highly effective in Kerrys system. Soon club managers were throwing every big man they would find, not making the cut at midfield, onto the fringe of the square. Players were put in goals for their kicking accuracy to be the next Cluxton. After Alex Fergusons use of super subs Sheringham and Solskjaer to land the  Champions League, certain players were soon called impact men, left on the bench so a manager could finish with a stronger team when he started when the defenders legs began to tire. People are easily influenced. Mick ODwyer and Kevin Heffernan always ramped their training upthey lost out to each other in the s tussles between the teams. ODwyer was reported to have trained the Kerry team  days in a row, to find an edge. Thats why it would be a breath of fresh airDublin and Limerick, the GAAs current benchmark, were to strip back their management teams and train collectively for two pitch sessions a week. With an increase in the number of gyms in clubs across Ireland on the up, would it not make better sense for county players to conduct their strength and conditioning work among their grass-roots. Counties who have invested a small fortune developing state of the art facilities will be pulling their hair out, but there are benefits to be had from a change in tact. Firstly, it would save the county board an extra couple of nights of travelling and feeding expenses. The players would have a greater bond with their club, who have spent money to kit out their facilities. Every county player would be given a programme to follow and be tested at ious key intervals. Lets face it, the players who really want to succeed will follow the plan. They could even educate their club friendship group on the basics, so there is a trickle down effect. And they can revolve the gym session around their work, family and getting home to watch Liverpool or Man United slug it out on the telly. The multiple lock-downs have shown us that video analysis meetings could all be done remotely via zoom. Counties could streamline feedback to last shorter and done from the players sofa. All of a sudden, the inter-county scene – while still offering a high level of preparation – is no longer equivalent to a second job, with the amount of travel and collective time a player has to commit to. Imagine this was of Peter Keanes tale after Kerry could manage to win Sam later this year and everyone followed. It would leave team expenses more manageable to county treasurers. Players would be able to fit in study, a family le and overtime at work. If this was the case, would the sixMayo players have retired  I think it would allow players to have a longer playing career, it would mean that less players would be fast-tracked in from minors. It would allow students to get a proper crack at playing for their Fresher and Sigerson teams. The club and county U competitions would find a proper home. As a result, the inter-county game would be closer to the amateur side of the scale than elite. The knock-on is having a better balance all round – both in the countys bank account and the players lestyle. And they will still get the buzz when they run out to test themselves against the best every other county has to offer. I have never met John Prenty, but I like his idea. It makes so much sense.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The mural at Great James Street was created by local company UV Arts. Ahead of the broadcast of the new ITV programme Home Sweet Home, which will feature Derry in an episode airing on Tuesday, February , it has been revealed that the mural was suggested by Joanna Lumley, the show’s presenter. Ms Lumley visited Derry in  to take part in a conference marking the th anniversary of Children in Crossfire, the charity set up by Mr Moore. She ed last autumn to film for the series in which she visits places special to her. googletag.cmd.push Ms Lumley said: “In Derry we wanted to film the historic murals, The Derry Girls and my friend Richard Moore, the ‘Derry Lama’, as the Dalai Lama calls him. “It suddenly seemed that we could link these three stories together by art: the ravishing mural Saoirse-Monica showed me of the Derry Girls led us easily to Karl, whose team is creating such important new art work in this fabulous city. “Would it be possible to celebrate the le-affirming achievements of the man the Dalai Lama calls ‘My hero’ in a mural  “The finished work is utterly magnicent, and I am proud that I was allowed to spray a tiny bit of it under Karl’s watchful eye. Part of me will always remain in Derry, a city I love with all my heart.” googletag.cmd.push  Mr Moore said: “When Joanna told me towards the end of our recording that we had one more stop to make, I could not have ever imagined what I was about to be shown. “I am so honoured and humbled at this wonderfully generous gesture. Joanna has been a good friend to me and a great supporter of Children in Crossfire, both of which mean a great deal to me. “She has also built a great rapport with Derry and many of its people, and I look forward to tuning in to Home Sweet Home to see our city at its best.     “I am also grateful to Karl Porter from UV Arts for his vision and genuine passion for this project”. Karl Porter from UV Arts, the creative arts team behind a whole host of public artworks in the city and the artist who painted the mural, said: “Its not everyday you get to paint a mural with Joanna Lumley, who is apparently very afraid of heights and I was told she will not get on the lt, but she did! “ “Joanna helped me direct the cherry picker and also painted one of the most important parts of the mural - the connection, the area where The Dalai Lama and Richard Moore touched. “I think the symbolism of this helps strengthen the relationship and the meaning behind the mural. “The mural depicts a Buddhist blessing, a signicant moment between His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Richard Moore. “The Unalome symbol rising from that connection is the Buddhist symbol representing the path to enlightenment. “Our journey in le is never perfect, never straight or even in the right direction but a journey nonetheless, full of lessons and experiences. Something that Richard has lived experience of, having overcome such a powerful injury to lead a wholesome and selfless le dedicated to others.” Karl said that when first approached about the project he was delighted to have the chance to celebrate one of Derrys greatest living heroes. “The chance to create our own connections led us to collaborate with Belfast based artist and illustrator Conor McClure and together create this powerful piece of art. “If you look closely, the shape of the heads and the Dalai Lamas embrace - forms the shape of a heart, a simple yet subtle way to celebrate the connections between these two iniduals. “It was a great privilege for me to be asked to produce this new mural. The image we have used is iconic, showing the Dalai Lama’s deep spirituality as well as his admiration for Richard Moore. I hope it will attract locals and visitors alike for many years to come and a poignant new addition to our street art movement in the city.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans involved the construction of  houses at a riverside site at Rossbay off the Limavady Road. Residents in the area had raised a large number of concerns in relation to the plans, including road safety and congestion issues. The plans were first submitted to Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning department in . They involved the proposed construction of  houses and eight bungalows on the land overlooking the River Foyle. After detailed examinations, the councils planning department recommended that the plans be approved. googletag.cmd.push However, the final say on planning applications rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and there was a y discussion on the plans for the Rossbay site. Representatives for local residents opposed to the development and the company behind the housing plans were given the opportunity to address the meeting. The meeting was told that although  objections had been received in relation to the plans, they involved multiple submissions from  properties in the surrounding area. This was the largest number of objections that the council has ever received in relation to a planning application. googletag.cmd.push After the ious arguments were put forward at todays meeting, DUP councillor Hilary McClintock proposed that the committee go against the recommendation of the councils planning department and refuse permission for the Waterside development. Her proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and supported unanimously by all the councillors who were eligible to vote at the meeting. If so wished, the developer can now appeal the councils decision through the Planning Appeals Commission.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The decision was taken after the Department conceded Mr Atherton had an arguable case. Signicant progress was made today in our challenge against the continued prohibition on children’s outdoor sport, said Mr Atherton. At the th hour, lawyers acting on behalf of the Department of Health conceded that we have presented an arguable case before the Court and the challenge will now move to a full expedited hearing on March . googletag.cmd.push While pursuing the review, Mr Atherton has again called on the Executive to lt the restrictions on youth sport immediately.

Accordingly we call on the NI Executive to allow all children toimmediately to the sporting arena, where they will find comfort, challenge and respite in physical exertion and the company of their friends. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr Fitzsimons is well-known for his walking tours in this area.ldquoI came up with the idea of doing the coastal path and following the pilgrim path to the holy well, he said.ldquoThe reason we did that was because of the outstanding natural beauty that is there. It is a really undiscovered kind of gem in the whole of the island in terms of the natural beauty.As part of the filming, Duane met the former president and Ciara for a picnic and a chat. ldquoWe staged the picnic at Ballyhornan with an upturned boat and our lunch on top of it, he explained.He added that it was a delight to meet the former president.ldquoMary McAleese was really quite personable and willing to get to know a bit about me and also about the whole area.The programmes takes guests to dferent locations in Ireland to talk about their spiritual journey through le.It is the second film in the current series to showcase the beauty of the Co Down countryside.The first film aired last month and featured the former president with Dundrum-born comedian Patrick Kielty on a walk through St Patrickrsquos Way in the Mournes.Mr Kielty was asked about his faith in God and replied: ldquoIf you are not going to believe in God walking up the Mourne Mountains, when are you going to believe in Him Former Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has also taken part in the series this year. Dr Tim Campbell, director of the St Patrick Centre, said he was delighted the focus was on Saint Patrickrsquos Way.He is looking forward to the new season of Camino-style walks being offered from April post lockdown.ldquoWe are really excited about the new coastal route we are offering which will be led in turns by guides Martina Purdy and Elaine Kelly, he said.ldquoThe walk some of the most beautul coast line on the island and features views of the Isle of Man on a clear day.ldquoThe well itself is amazing and the walk also takes in the historic church ruin at Ardtole.

A number of residents were also forced to leave their homes.The mortar was discovered at the side of a busy road close to the entrance to Tievenadarragh Wood and after it was inspected by Army Technical Officers and declared safe, the device was taken away for detailed forensic examination.A number of politicians have expressed concern that this is the third device of its kind linked to dissident republicans which has been discovered in the area over the past two years.Previous devices linked to the terror group have been discovered just a few miles from Seaforde at the Priestrsquos Road and Drumcaw Road near Clough.PSNI District Commander, Superintendent Norman Haslett, has confirmed that the device discovered at the Newcastle Road was a suspected component part of a mortar, but did not contain any explosives.He said that while it was too early to attribute ownership to any particular grouping, he believed that dissident republican terrorists were responsible.Mr Haslett said the matter remained under investigation and appealed for anyone who can assist police with their enquiries to get in contact with them.Politicians have roundly condemned those responsible for leaving the device at the side of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.South Down SDLP MLA Colin McGrath, Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan and Slieve Croob Ulster Unionist councillor Alan Lewis, said there was no justication for the actions of those responsible.Mr McGrath described the discovery of the mortar component as ldquovery concerning and said the repercussions of the weekend incident could have been devastating.He declared: Such devices are a thing of our past and have no place in our modern country. The inconvenience and impact of this incident on the local community will be considerable and I condemn those that placed that device.ldquoThe fact that the Newcastle Road had to be closed for a number of hours last Saturday evening is both infuriating and depressing. Infuriating because some iniduals wish to bring violence upon us and depressing at the thought of what might have come to pass,the device had not been found and dealt with.Mr McGrath, who thanked the emergency services for their swt response to the security alert, said those responsible ldquohave nothing to offer our society and are utterly contemptible.Condemning those responsible for the ldquodisruptive security alert, Ms Rogan described what happened as ldquoreckless activity.She declared: ldquoThe arearsquos district police commander has confirmed that a component part of a mortar device was found which could have been more sinister. Whoever was responsible for leaving this device and causing this disruption has shown complete disregard for the local community. There can be no justication for this type of reckless activity and those responsible need to cease these futile acts.Cllr Lewis said leaving a device at the side of the road ldquodemonstrates the stupidity of those responsible.He declared: ldquoTerrorism always finds a cause to attach itself and those seeking to ignite chaos and mayhem should reflect on the long-term realities of their aims. Tit-for-tat violence reenergises age-old conflict and no one will benefit from rising tension and public disorder.ldquoThose responsible are Neanderthals, plastic soldiers with romantic fantasies of days gone by. Just what are they trying to achieve Cllr Lewis said residents were ldquorightly alarmed at what happened last weekend, confirming that he is angry that a third mortar-type device has now been found in this part of the district in the past two years.He added: ldquoIt is time for the police to act. I want to see searches, investigations and arrests. I fear that dissident republicans are armed and dangerous and weapons in the hands of those who lack intelligence could quite possibly result in the loss of le.ldquoThis is  not  and those behind this incident need to pack up and go home. If they canrsquot win elections it demonstrates that the community doesnrsquot want nor support them and I question what mindless criminals behind this behaviour have to offer society.Anyone who can assist police with their enquiries is asked to get in touch using the non-emergency  number, quoting reference    .Information can also be provided online at http:www.psni.police.uk makeareport  or by using the confidential Crimestoppers number  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Downpatrick’s Conor makes move to Glens  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS Conor McMenamin has made the cross-city switch from Irish Premiership side Cltonville to Belfast rivals Glentoran.The -year old midfielder is back at the Oval for a second spell after a move to Warrenpoint Town followed by over two years at Solitude.Glentoran striker Paul OrsquoNeill is moving to Cltionville as part of the deal.Glentoran manager Mick McDermott said was delighted to secure McMenaminrsquos capture.ldquoWe are excited to secure the signature of Conor, arguably the hottest property in the league at this time, he remarked.ldquoI have always said that we will be interested when quality players become available.

The location has been a vital area for sports for decades within district, but there has been underinvestment for some time, leaving our area behind other council areas.Cllr Sharvin, who tabled an original proposal for a dedicated working group to oversee the development of the park, said the intention is for council officials to carry out investigative work to identy what areas of Dunleath can be developed, given flood plain issues in the area.He explained that once this investigative work is completed, it would enable the working group to identy what facilities can be accommodated in the areas identied.Cllr Sharvin said the working group would be able to advance the project to the business case stage for capital spend to be committed, paving the way for work to start.ldquoThis is the process the council undertakes for any project but, disappointingly, the council did not seem to want to follow its own process used for other projects, he continued.ldquoAt the recent Active and Healthy Communities Committee the item was discussed for a second time in two months, with councillors rejecting a recommendation not to set up a working group.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that Downpatrick area councillors will meet shortly with senior council officers to identy recommendations for the future development of Dunleath Park which the Active and Healthy Communities Committee can consider.He added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council cannot under value the importance of Dunleath to Downpatrick.ldquoThe area provides a great opportunity to really develop the area through walking trails around the perimeter of the site, upgrade the existing facilities and identy new ones that can be delivered.ldquoCovid has taught us all the importance of getting out and being active and Downpatrick town centre does not have a town park that provides all of that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-Fishing.jpg","title":"Fishing communities urged to apply for European funding  ","story":"AN appeal has been issued to people in the Ardglass area to make funding bids under the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Groupprogramme.Applications for the latest funding round must be submitted by the end of next month with work on successful schemes completed by October next year.Funding is being made to fishing communities under the European Maritime Fisheries Fund to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth, job creation and supporting labour mobility in coastal and inland communities.Proposed projects must be in the Ardglass area with applicants able to demonstrate how schemes will impact on those who rely upon the fishing industry.Key themes of the funding programme include adding value to fishery and aquaculture products and supporting their ersication and promotion, creating opportunities for lelong learning, attracting young people into fisheries, aquaculture and maritime related careers and activities.The funding programme also aims to promote social well-being and cultural heritage and developing and enhancing environmental assets of fisheries areas.Cllr Dermot Curran mdash who lives in Ardglass mdash says the funding aims to help make a dference and deliver socio-economic benefits to the communities along the Co Down coastline that continue to rely heavily on the fishing industry.He says he is pleased that people and businesses in the Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie areas are being given an opportunity to benefit from the funding.ldquoThe programme provides an opportunity to strengthen and ersy the economy, making a real dference to their respective communities through developing and delivering innovative projects, he continued.There are currently plans to regenerate the port in Ardglass and thevillagersquos harbour development group has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start economic regeneration, one of which includes dredging the harbour.There are also plans to upgrade berthing facilities and relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour.Cllr Curran said he was keen to see investment provided to secure the future of the three Co Down ports which are responsible for sustaining signicant jobs on land and at sea.He added: ldquoThe needs of local fishermen and their dependent communities is vitally important.The needs of the fishing community and the challenges it faces must be front and centre.One-to-one virtual workshops are available for the SEAFLAG programme including help with procurement, application form guidance and registration.Projects seeking financial support should be based in the Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie or surrounding areas and demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities and a reminder issued that applications submitted after March  may not be accepted.Anyone requiring assistance is asked to contact SEAFLAG on   or email sea@flagnmandd.org to arrange a meeting.

It also warns it will not stand by and see peoplersquos lives put at risk by comments designed to advance particular political causes.KILLINCHY ndash Local politicians have expressed their concern about the future of the Carpets International factory in Killinchy.The plant which employs  people, many of them from Down District, faces an uncertain future after its American owners revealed its plans to downsize and restructure its operation across the United Kingdom.Fears are growing that both the Killinchy plant, and its sister factory in Donaghadee, could be forced to close their doors, with the loss of  jobs. Speculation that the plant could close is increasing because of the American firmrsquos continued refusal to say whether or not the local plants will be spared from the axe.DRUMAROAD ndash The ongoing saga surrounding the attempted demolition of Drumaroad parish hall will be in the High Court again on Friday.At the hearing Fr John Moley, PP, will attempt to have lted an injunction preventing the demolition of the hall but local residents have said they will fight the move.The case had been listed for hearing last Friday but on Wednesday Fr Moley submitted an affidavit outlining his reasons for proposing the demolition.

It was something in the back of my mind to do but lockdown made me do it a lot earlier.She started up her consultancy business just over a year ago and has had to ldquothink outside the box since last March when social distancing became a new norm in the pandemic.ldquoWhen I first started the business, I wanted to empower children and their parents who would get an extra boost of some specialised training from me, she said. ldquoSometimes itrsquos hard for children to get all of their educational needs fully met in school.ldquoWhen I work one to one with them, itrsquos amazing to see their progress, even in such a short space of time. You see them really start to fly once their sensory system calms down and they are ready to take in information.Challenged by how she could still run her business during lockdown, Judith decided to put the eight acres of woodland she and her husband owns around their Crawfordstown Road home to good use.ldquoWe took over one acre and created the woodland classroom which can be accessed by a lot of willow structures that I created myself. Therersquos a massive tree house, things to swing on and climb on for the children to enjoy before they go into the woodland classroom which has everything an indoor classroom would have, she said.ldquoItrsquos actually great for both parents and children as they can listen to the birds and enjoy the woodland while their children are involved in learning activities.Judith has  years of experience of education special needs children after graduating from Cambridge University.ldquoI was always passionate about working with children with special needs and when I came back home I was fortunate enough to start working in Knockevin rather than starting in primary schools which I fully expected to do, said Judith.ldquoAfter a while I went to work in Bahrain to set up a school for special needs children on a three-year contract. I came back home just as things began to kick off in the Arab Spring and ed to work at Knockevin.ldquoI decided to set up my own practice in  as it was time to give some empowerment to parents as well as children. It gave me a chance to work with all aspects of a childrsquos development rather than working with one class for the whole year.Judith specialises in working with children aged -. She is also a training consultant for parents to help them understand their childrenrsquos sensory needs and working with staff from health organisations.Judith explained that while working with children with special needs is more complex and involves eight senses mdash not the five senses that we are all more familiar with mdash it can be very rewarding.ldquoAny child whorsquos born does not come with a training book, said Judith. ldquoSpecial needs children have very specic needs and you need to be able to read them in order to cater for that need.ldquoWith the coaching style I use, itrsquos about empowering parents to understand which sensory need their child needs to be fulfilled. With special needs children, you have to fill up with their sensory cup with all eight senses before they can start to learn, When the three extra senses are stimulated, they can be super-calming for everyone but particularly for children who canrsquot communicate their needs.ldquoWhen I coach parents, I explain about the three other senses, and tell what Irsquom doing and why Irsquom doing it to calm their child so that they then can keep using the same strategies at home. As the child learns to self-regulate more, the strategies change and the child is helped along the way.Despite having the space to accommodate more children after lockdown and when group activities are allowed again, Judith is focussed in developing her consultancy with the child always in mind.ldquoThe whole essence of the business is that it does not become a massive enterprise, she stressed.ldquoItrsquos about providing a more quiet, intimate area for the children so that they can feel safe and secure and itrsquos not overly busy. While I can expand and offer more sessions as the days gets longer, the woodland classroom will never be too busy.For further information visit www.empoweringlittleminds..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3Feb2021-NewcastleSPORT.jpg","title":"Royal County Down comes out top  ","story":"ROYAL County Down has been recognised as the most picturesque golf course in the world.The famed Newcastle links came out on top of a study by the Surprise Shop website, which looked at  of the most stunning courses from around the world.The  found that Royal County Down was the subject of , Instagram posts.

Previously, Enda Kenny’s administration had been working with the UK to develop a light-touch surveillance system on the real boundary. Leo Varadkar and Mr Coveney jettisoned this work, adopting instead a high-risk tactic which they hoped would wreck Brexit. The responsibility is theirs.During the negotiations, the UK did not ask for any border controls but the EU insisted on scrupulous controls, ostensibly to protect the sanctity of its single market. The EU can be flexible when it wants, but chose to dig in on this issue.The UK should have left it to the EU to decide how to patrol its own frontier. If Dublin genuinely believed that a few CCTV cameras would provoke an upsurge in republican terrorism, it should have committed itself to working with the UK to maintain law and order.Alternatively, the EU could have decided to apply controls between the British Isles and mainland Europe. The British Isles have a long-established Common Travel Area . London and Dublin affirmed in May  that this would continue after Brexit Mr Coveney signed up for Ireland. This enables Irish people to enter and remain in the UKwithout restriction, unlike other EU citizens.Why could similarly exceptional arrangements not have been applied to goods  Would this not have reinforced the Belfast agreement by promoting cooperation north south and east west  It would certainly have avoided customs duties and regulatory barriers between Britain and Ireland removed other obstacles to east-west trade reflected the reality that the UK is Ireland’s principal trading partner in Europe and avoided the need to inspect goods twice which are travelling between Ireland and Europe via Great Britain.Looking ahead, Michael Gove co-chairs a joint committee with the EU, whose role is to resolve problems over the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. Mr Gove now acknowledges that there is a problem requiring serious and urgent attention. At the least, the wording of the protocol must be claried and the EU must work with the UK government in good faith to repair the damage.Credit is due to Jim Allister who beat the DUP to the chase last week. Their statement as printed in Wednesday’s News Letter is welcome. The electorate will judge them by their actions over the coming months.Bill Smith, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Now, these industries have been replaced by others. Perhaps neither as impressive nor as lucrative as the iron-wroughts of the past but still they are a source of daily bread. However, for people such as myself this source is now at risk. Whomever was tasked with representing Northern Ireland’s interests at the Brexit trade talks saw fit to acquiesce in Northern Ireland’s removal from the single market for services. In layman’s terms this means that contractors, freelancers, specialists and consultants who have their practices based in Northern Irelandare potentially barred from trading in the EU . If this comes to pass then I will have to take my practice out of Northern Ireland and base it in a country that can allow me to work with the EU . Though not immediately apparentit will certainly be felt by those whom manage my affairs in Northern Ireland and of course Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will no longer be entitled to its percentage of my company’s earnings. This act could be replicated a thousandfold as northern based consultants have to move their admin where. I would ask that those who claim to stand for NI’s best interests go back to the drawing board and see to it that NI can be re-inserted into the single market for services. Rather than being a place that consultants will have to relocate from NI could instead become a place that consultants relocate to, as such a development would not escape the attention of consultants and service providers in GB who find themselves similarly cut off from EU work. Surely it is in our interests to have thousands of companies set up shop in Northern Ireland, pay tax here and utilise local services  There needs to be more examination of the actual consequences of our Brexit arrangements and proposals rather than acting out of blind zeal, which, I fear, has been the guiding hand of too many of those involved. If people find themselves more easily moved by rhetoric and fervour rather than daily bread issues then perhaps they could honourably choose to stand aside in favour of those whose vision is less clouded  Neale Weir, Castledawson, Co Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I would categorise the album’s genre as a kind of mix between indie folk and dream pop. “The title ‘Destroyer’ came from a personal point of view. Depression and mental health is a big theme on the album and intends to allude to the idea of one’s own worst enemy who causes their own problems - your own destroyer.”Abraham’s Daughter was released in May  to much acclaim in the Belfast music scene and Conn also has some classical piano compositions and short film scores under his belt to date.“I take inspiration from a lot of dferent musical styles such as my background in classical and jazz piano, but my main influences now would include David Bowie, Sufjan Stevens, Phoebe Bridgers and Fiona Apple.”For the self-produced album, the versatile former Larne Grammar School pupil had to teach himself how to record, mix and master the audio for its release. “It was completed in just over a month, save for the two tracks recorded in March for the Abraham’s Daughter EP which reappear on this album, which was recorded by my university classmate Lewis Murray.”The experience of playing the piano for nearly two decades - including successes at Larne Music Festival - and performing at classical concerts across Northern Ireland should also stand Conn in good stead as he pursues his dream during the pandemic.---Click here to read: Larne musician’s new stage show for when the curtains go back up.--Thank you for reading this article.

Paul is not only a colleague but a trusted friend, who has served his constituents and party with distinction, and will continue to do so.ldquoThere is urgent work in front of all of us and our immediate focus will be continuing to hold the Labour administration in the Senedd to account on vital issues such as the vaccine rollout, and fighting Mays election alongside our excellent slate of candidates and dedicated volunteers.ldquoWe are in a moment like no other, and the COVID- pandemic has sadly only served to shine a spotlight on the challenges in peoplersquos everyday lives challenges that have been made all the harder by twenty of Welsh Labour Government failure.ldquoFrom our fragile economy to ever increasing NHS waiting lists, people in Wales have been badly let down by successive Labour administrations. Let me be clear devolution isnrsquot the issue, it is the socialists in the Labour Party, and Wales deserves better.ldquoIn just over  days, the Welsh public will head to the ballot box to decide on the future they want for our country and in the coming weeks and months the Welsh Conservatives will put forward a positive plan to get Wales moving again and build back our country better than ever.ldquoThis will be in tough election during a tough time for our country and whereas other parties want to use this period to ide and separate, wersquoll seek to unite our country and deliver a strong voice for Wales, in a strong United Kingdom.Chairman of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Senedd, Janet Finch-Saunders MS said Mr Davies had been confirmed in the post following a meeting of the Welsh Conservative Group in the Senedd this morning.ldquoAs Chairman of the Group, I want to say thank you to Paul Davies for his immense efforts in the post since . Paul played a key role in our record-breaking General Election in , whilst setting the groundwork ahead of Mays Senedd election.ldquoOur attention now turns to May and taking the fight to the Labour Party. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Penarth and District Lesotho Trust, who since  have organised several group visits for people from the Penarth area to Lesotho, South Africa, following several visits by members of local churches, and links were made specically with the town of Teyateyaneng.Over the years, the initial focus of contact between churches broadened out so that the relationship developed to involve schools, childrenrsquos homes, and the wider community.Every two years, a group of young people, mainly from Stanwell School, visited Teyateyaneng and spent time teaching in Rantuba High School and St Matthias Primary School, taking with them stationery and a iety of hats, gloves, and scarves, all of which had been donated by friends and family.Last year, two of the trustees arranged for twenty boxes of used Lego and Duplo, which had also been donated, to be shipped to Lesotho and then went out to distribute it around the schools and give training on its use to the teachers.A very special relationship developed with two organisations in particular ndash the TY Junior Academy, a residential school founded by Godfrey Kakande and run now by his daughter Irene Nagingo, and St Ceciliarsquos Orphanage and Centre for Teenage Mothers run by Father Augustine Mahlaku.Father Augustine Mahlaku at St Ceciliarsquos Church ndash during the welcome for the Youth Group in Much of the fundraising has been for these two places, although the charity has also financed drought relief and the training of a nurse, supported a clinic in the capital of Maseru, and helped Growing Nations which aims to teach sustainable agriculture to young people.MORE NEWS:At the school, the Trust has been able to fund the building of a kitchen, a library and refurbishment of classrooms and at St Ceciliarsquos money has been sent to build a meeting room and purchase agricultural equipment and supplies.This will be the last meeting as the decision to dissolve the charity was taken last year due to the trustees being unable to continue due to health and or family reasons, leaving only six trustees which is an insufficient number and would reduce even further within a year.Attempts to recruit more trustees have been unsuccessful and so, with regret, it was decided to close the charity, winding it down over the course of this year.PADLT would like to thank the people of Penarth and district for supporting the charity by giving donations and attending its annual plant sale and craft fair and other events over the years.The next annual general meeting of the Trust will be held on Tuesday, February ,  at .am via Zoom link.If anyone would like further information or would like to attend the AGM, please send an email to padlt.info@gmail. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Andso, what will now be permitted under each level as more people become vaccinated.Identy and understand the conditions that need to be met before rolling back certain restrictions, and ultimately the need for social distancing.Outline how the vaccine will be deployed once the most vulnerable groups are inoculated, to reach the governmentrsquos target of all UK adults being offered a vaccine by autumn.Think how regular mass rapid testing in the community and workplaces could allow a wider, speedier reopening of the economy.Create bespoke, detailed plans for the harder to open sectors of the economy, such as testing regimes for international travel, or the conditions for activities such as hospitality and live events to .Running alongside the roadmap there must be clear parameters for determining what, and for how long, economic support measures remain in place, the CBI say.:Mr Price said: ldquoThe prime minister has set out the initial parameters for reopening as a country, which was a big help for businesses.\"Clearly, the precise dates will be determined by data, so letrsquos use this time wisely to get the roadmap right together for when lockdown ends.ldquoThere is huge appetite among businesses to help the Welsh Government create and deliver a roadmap out of lockdown that lasts, has national consensus and kickstarts our economic recovery as  unfolds.ldquoA common framework with devolved administrations must also be possible and help to minimise dferences in approach, and we will work closely with the Welsh Government to help promote that consistency.ldquoBusinesses are currently completely in the dark when planning for the weeks and months ahead and this is hindering investment. We can provide more clarity and do the prep work now to enable them to plan for reopening and growth.ldquoItrsquos clear that we will be entering a new normal even post-vaccination. We will have new workplace, testing and economic realities to live with.ldquoWersquove all learnt a lot in  about what reopening looks like so letrsquos move now to a plan for  that is detailed, practical and instils confidence. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

Business support was a key topic, and it was devastating to hear Tina McKenzie, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, discuss the hardships being faced and demonstrating the very bleak outlook for many businesseswe do not find a way forward both in terms of the handling of the pandemic,but also enhancing the support available to these businesses. The impact on business is substantial and that on each of their employees is devastating. Furlough has been a hottopic during this lockdown and as we have seen business vilied for not looking atrestructures, she reminded us of the fact that whilst the support available is welcomed, itremains far from enough to enable survival. I recently received an email from a local politician who stated, “I’m in awe you are still in business”. While this could be accepted as a compliment, this is far from the support andvoice a small business like mine requires or is looking for, and this was conveyed to them. The business community needs a clear voice with a key message and desire, rather than noise. These voices, like Tina, work tirelessly to press the government to step in with moresupport, minimising their costs and contribution while revenues are non-existent, and Iapplaud them for doing so. With news breaking this week that there is still pound million remaining in the Stormont COVID “pot” to be allocated towards businesses before March, I would urge Diane Doddsand Conor Murphy to listen to businesses and their representatives to ensure businessessurvive. It would be truly shamefulthis money had to be ed to Westminster as a result of poor planning and slow reactions, while local businesses are making very dficultdecisions due to lack of financial support which clearly is available, but not utilised. With financial survival for businesses and more importantly each of us as iniduals and our families the sole aim, Tina succinctly reminded us that our elected representatives should beheld to account, not the businesses themselves. The Sunday Times recently reported that the public feels more frightened now than at any time before with % of voters feeling ‘personally threatened’ by COVID. It also reportedthat Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have agreed on a ‘recovery plan’ to save jobs. The realityis however, thatthey and our own Executive do not deliver this strategy correctly, without delay or U-turn, the job market will constrict further. Many professional trade bodies arereporting that their members don’t have enough in the bank until April and judging bynumerous reports this past week, lockdown and on-going restrictions are likely to extend beyond April. How can businesses be expected to survive without this  We all have a voice, but not all of us use it. As a business community we need vocal and active business leaders to speak out to help fight our case. A great demonstrative exampleof this is the great work of my good friend Brian Donaldson from Excluded NI. Throughout,Brian has spoken out and acted to help thousands who have been financially excluded with no support being provided to them. Brian had established himself as newly self-employedchef just before lockdown, only to find that as support packages were announced, he quickly found himself excluded from all government support offered. With a family, and amortgage to pay, Brian created a  for his case to constructively find a resolution forall those who found themselves in the same situation. By working closely with local politicians, Brian, has researched and submitted proposals to the Department for the Economy with numerous resolutions and proposals to deliver financialassistance to these groups, which has resulted in thousands, including Ltd Company directors,eventually being awarded some financial support. Brian continues daily to ensure the excluded have a voice and shows how being a voice can bring about change! As a business owner, I send a huge thank you to all the hard-working professional trade bodies and voices for our communities, who throughout this time have worked tirelessly toensure we all have all have a business toto in the future. If you, like so many, are in adficult situation, be sure to reach out to your local business trade body today to highlight your plight and use their voices as much as you can. We all need as much support andsurvival mechanism as possible. It’s evident that the more voices there are and the louderthey become successful outcomes can be delivered. I will wrap up by leaving you with a well-known quote by Napoleon Bonaparte: ‘Ten people who speak make more noise than ten thousand who are silent’. Until next week, stay safe!

Heres how you can make it and what you need to serve it up!  Pancake mix - serves   egg  cup of self raising flour  potato peeled and grated   bunch of spring onions Salt and pepper  cup of milk  For the salad  bag of mixed leaf salad salad  cherry tomatoes    red onion sliced  packet of smoked salmon   Cream cheese mix  tablespoons of cream cheese  tablespoons of wholegrain mustard  To make the pancakes Transfer the grated potatoes to a dry tea towel and squeeze any excess water out. Transfer to a large bowl. Break in the egg and mix well, add the flour and mix again. Slowly add spring onion and gradually add milk . Heat a large non stick pan to the stove bring up to a medium heat. Drizzle in a little oil . Add approximately one tablespoon of the mix and cook for approximately three minutes each side until golden brown. Repeat For the poached egg bring a small saucepan with   pint of water to the boil, add one tablespoon of white vinegar or the juice of one lemon and a pinch of salt. Whisk it together - this will create a whirlpool effect. Add in your egg and take off the heat. To make the salad Place the mixed leaf in a large mixing bowl along with tomato and red onions and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle a little olive oil through the salad. For the cream cheese mix, quite simply mix together! Add a little salt pepper to taste of your liking. The presentation In a large bowl or plate place the pancake at the bottom of the dish. Arrange your salad . Neatly place on the smoked salmon and while this is being done the egg will be cooked. Lt it out with a slotted spoon and dab onto a sheet of kitchen paper - this drains off any access water. Place it on top of the salad, add the bit of baby spinach and some black pepper... and enjoy!
