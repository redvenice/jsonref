I was living his life for him. It was becoming beneficial for both of us. It was a coping mechanism advantageous to me, too.\u0027Marcus was so dedicated to his task that he managed to sustain this happy family myth for 13 years after Alex\u0027s accident in 1982 — but the fantasy he meticulously constructed was to utterly collapse after their mother\u0027s death in 1995.         Alex (left) and Marcus (right) have since released a book about their story which has been made into a Netflix documentaryWhile clearing their home of her possessions, Alex discovered an indecent photograph of them as children, with shattering ramifications for them both.Alex\u0027s search for the truth, and Marcus\u0027s painful reluctance to share it with him, is now the subject of a moving Netflix documentary, Tell Me Who I Am, which was also released in cinemas last month.\u0027Imagine a black, empty space. You\u0027ve lost everything in your life and you start from a blank canvas. Imagine how scary that would be,\u0027 Marcus says in the film.But, while Alex\u0027s quest for knowledge was driven by desperation to fill his mental void, both brothers admit they had a profound need to re-establish their twin bond.\u0027We have a thing,\u0027 says Alex, now 55. \u0027This is how we explain it. Most siblings operate on 100 per cent. Twins, identical twins, operate on 110 per cent. Some of that was missing and that\u0027s what I wanted back. I felt incomplete.\u0027Any secrets, then, would come between that bond.And there was much Marcus was concealing from Alex... The twins were born seemingly blessed, their arrival announced in The Times newspaper, published on February 3, 1964, telling of the birth on January 31 of twin sons to Jill and husband John Langford-Lewis. Three weeks later, however, a second posting was published in The Times. This announced the death of John Langford-Lewis, \u0027darling father of three-week-old twins, Alexander and Marcus\u0027.John was killed in a car crash. What the notice did not say was that baby Alexander was also in the car when it was hit by another vehicle in Wandsworth, South London, on the way home from hospital after his birth (fortuitously, Marcus had been kept in with a chest infection). When they were hit side-on, Alex, who was cradled on his mother\u0027s lap in the front seat, shot through the windscreen with his father. His mother, unlike his father, was wearing a seatbelt and escaped unscathed.Alex and his father were both put on life support. Alex made it — but his father succumbed.If the kindly John Langford-Lewis had been wearing a seatbelt, it\u0027s possible the twins\u0027 story might have turned out differently. But he wasn\u0027t. Instead, the boys were left in the care of their mother, a twist of fate with horrific consequences.Seven years after John\u0027s death, their mother married Jack Dudley, a cold, forbidding man. The twins had little to do with him, apart from entering his study each evening, shaking his hand and saying: \u0027Good night, Sir.\u0027However, as Alex recovered after his motorbike accident many years later, Marcus painted a rosier picture of family life. Their mother and stepfather, for example, never took the twins on holiday. But Marcus found a photo of them on a beach, holidaying with friends, and told Alex it was a family holiday.It\u0027s not difficult to understand why Marcus was so eager to forget their childhood and spare his brother. \u0027The abuse started when I was about eight, possibly earlier. I don\u0027t have many memories before I was eight because I was so traumatised,\u0027 says Marcus.\u0027Over many years, it happened sporadically.\u0027His mother hid behind her background, which gave her carte blanche to do what she wanted. \u0027Sexual abuse has no boundaries,\u0027 he says.The last time it happened, adds Marcus, was when he was about 14. His mother drove him to the house of a well-known artist in London whom Marcus had never met. They all had dinner and some wine. Then, as she always did, his mother left him and went home.The evening proceeded as it usually did when Marcus and Alex were left with strange men by their mother: the man took him to bed.But, on this occasion, Marcus told the man he did not want this, and left. He took the train back to Sussex and got Alex to open the window when he arrived home.\u0027Mum was very surprised to see me at breakfast the next morning,\u0027 says Marcus. \u0027But she didn\u0027t say a word. That was the last time it happened.\u0027What happened was simply not discussed, either between the twins or with other members of their family. \u0027If our stepfather had not been a tyrant, we\u0027d have gone to him and he\u0027d probably have done something about it,\u0027 says Marcus.\u0027He wasn\u0027t a very nice man, but I have no evidence to say he was involved.\u0027Following that final night in London says Marcus, he and his brother moved into an unheated shed outside the house, where they remained.\u0027It became a safe space for us. They called it a studio, but it was a shed. Better out of the house than in.\u0027On the night of Alex\u0027s accident in 1982, Marcus woke with a jolt, feeling anxious. Such was their intuitive bond, he told his mother he knew his twin was in hospital. Yet it was some hours later that she took the call from doctors.As for the scale of his catastrophic injuries, Alex says: \u0027From the brain surgeons I\u0027ve spoken to, they think the first car accident compounded the second accident.\u0027Alex could remember how to speak, but nothing else.\u0027You\u0027re taught how to walk, go to the bathroom. You don\u0027t know how to do your shoelaces up, you\u0027ve never watched a TV. All you have is speech. I don\u0027t think even Marcus realised how hard living in a blank world was,\u0027 he says today.Once home, Marcus played out a complex charade that their family life — sleeping in the unheated outhouse their cruel stepfather who called them \u0027the dim twins\u0027 their erratic mother — was all normal.Marcus never confronted his mother about the abuse, and she never acknowledged it — though, they presume, was aware that Alex remembered nothing of it.Unaware of his mother\u0027s real nature, Alex even grew to love her. For, vile though her actions had been, she could also be warm and maternal.Little wonder, then, that Alex was distraught to find his mother at the bottom of the stairs, unconscious, in March 1995, some 13 years after his car accident.She was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was to prove fatal, and she died aged 64 (her second husband had died five years earlier).Alex was surprised by his brother\u0027s reaction: \u0027He didn\u0027t even cry.\u0027 Marcus, meanwhile, admits he felt nothing after his mother\u0027s death. Rather, he was determined to keep the past buried.After the funeral, the twins started clearing out the family home. In the attic were boxes of old Christmas cards for the twins sent by friends and family, some with money inside, none of which their mother had given them. And they found a large stash of love letters from men with whom their mother had clearly had affairs.While Alex now says he began to experience a disconcerting sense that his mother was not the woman he thought she was, it wasn\u0027t until they cleared her bedside table that the horrific truth became apparent.In it, they found a picture of themselves aged around ten, naked, with their heads cropped off.\u0027For me, everything just disintegrated at that point,\u0027 says Alex. \u0027My mind was going all over the place. I asked Marcus what it was all about it, this photo, but he wasn\u0027t giving me anything.\u0027A few weeks later, I hit him with the question. Did Mummy abuse us?\u0027He said: Yes. I just went into meltdown.\u0027Alex begged Marcus to tell him the truth, but Marcus wanted to protect Alex — and, he now admits, himself.Eventually, however, he told Alex in broad terms what happened, both with her and her \u0027male associates\u0027.Yet so traumatic were the memories and so strong his desire to protect his twin that Marcus was still unable to share the full truth. Outwardly, the twins somehow went on as normal. They travelled and, thanks to a substantial inheritance, invested in property and opened a hotel in Zanzibar.Alex settled in North London Marcus bought a property in Hampshire. Both married and both had two children. Alex says his wife helped him through much of the aftermath of his horrific discovery.The brothers\u0027 relationship was good, but, says Marcus, \u0027operating at 100 per cent, not at twin level\u0027.While they wrote a bestselling book about their experiences, Tell Me Who I Am, which was published in 2013, it was only during filming for the documentary (it took five years before they agreed to tell their story on camera) that Marcus finally opened up about the abuse.Alex says that hearing his brother revealing the whole truth has miraculously shrunk the monster he had created in his head. His trauma has begun to come to a close, although he wishes his brother had told him earlier.Marcus, too, concedes that he should have revealed all sooner — but was motivated only by a wish to protect his beloved twin.As if all this wasn\u0027t enough to cope with, there had been further shock for the twins, when, researching their book, they learned their mother had put them up for adoption at a year old.\u0027We didn\u0027t know that,\u0027 says Marcus. \u0027Our ghostwriter, Joanna Hodgkin, who did the book with us, found letters from friends of hers urging her to come and get us from a foster home. She was shamed into getting her kids back.\u0027When asked if they loved their mother, the twins have, in the past, given remarkably similar answers. \u0027That\u0027s a hard question,\u0027 said Marcus in one interview. \u0027It would be too easy for me to say no. The answer is, I probably did.\u0027As for Alex, he says: \u0027That\u0027s a hard one. I was very angry with her over the years. If I could understand why she did it, I probably could. In that period I was a child, I didn\u0027t know anything different and she was my mother.\u0027After they finished the documentary, the whole truth in the open at last, the brothers went to the pub. \u0027We sat in the pub and bought a beer,\u0027 says Alex. \u0027Marcus said: Are we good? And I said: Yeah, we\u0027re good. \u0027Tell Me Who I Am is in cinemas and on Netflix now. "},{"url":null,"title":"ROSE PRINCE Britain went dippy hummus","story":"Share this article Hummus’s heritage is hotly contested. Countries including Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Israel all claim to be the place where it was born. Most food historians agree the first hummus was eaten in Egypt, but nowadays it is diplomatic to describe it as being originally from the Levant: a region covering much of the Middle East as well as the Eastern Mediterranean as far north as Greece.Which is why I, seated in Costa’s in my party puffball skirt, believed hummus to be Greek. In Britain, we have embraced it in countless forms: Zorba turns out varieties including beetroot (ugh), peppers, lemon and coriander, caramelised onion, peri-peri, pesto and Parmesan, jalapeno, avocado, feta and, seemingly, the entire contents of the kitchen cupboard.Such fancy versions would not impress the inhabitants of countries such as India, Pakistan and Ethiopia, where 20 per cent of folk depend on the chickpea as their primary source of protein.         Smooth, beige and smeared inelegantly on a plate: if we ate only with our eyes, we’d never touch hummus, let alone pick up a dollop with pitta bread or a carrot stick. But, goodness, Britons seem to love itAnd, like many foodstuffs in poorer countries, the lack of genetic ersity in chickpea plants is a very serious problem.Scientists expect more droughts, heat stress and insect pests, creating the need for new varieties of food-producing plants with qualities that will let them adapt to changing conditions.But geneticists have discovered that chickpea plants do not adapt so easily.During human history, about 6,000 different plants have been cultivated for food, but now about half our energy-intake comes from just three: maize, rice and wheat — with chickpeas at No 13 in the Top Of The Crops chart.This week’s major recall concentrates the mind on the fact that hummus — as long as you have an electric blender to hand — is one of the easiest, most economical dishes to make.It also, like so much that is home-made, tastes freshly different when compared to a shop-bought tub, and can easily be tailored to suit your own taste.As they say, out of disaster comes opportunity. Make it once and it may never appear on your shopping list again."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/10/16/4EF5629000000578-5622363-image-a-8_1533914393940.jpg","title":"Glasgow named European Commission cultural creative capital UK","story":"Share this article Glasgow was also hailed for its \u0027openness, tolerance and trust\u0027.London, Bristol, Brighton and Manchester round out the rest of the top five UK cultural cities. Glasgow is home to more than 100 cultural organisations. The council claims more people visit Glasgow\u0027s museums each year than in any other UK city outside of London.          The council claims more people visit Glasgow\u0027s museums each year than in any other UK city outside of London.

You have seen lots of people standing down.\u0027He just in good conscience couldn\u0027t go out on the doorstep and say vote for me and get Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street.\u0027  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said: \u0027This is a truly devastating indictment of Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s leadership.\u0027Ian Austin has been a Labour MP for 14 years so he knows Corbyn better than most. He says that a vote for Corbyn\u0027s Labour would put businesses and jobs at risk, that Corbyn\u0027s economic policies would make our country worse and that his ideas on Brexit are a complete fantasy.\u0027This comes straight after the party\u0027s second most powerful person quit because he could no longer support Corbyn, in another hammer blow to his authority.\u0027Corbyn\u0027s MPs are saying what we all know – he is unfit to be Prime Minister.\u0027    Some Labour moderates have vowed to continue to fight for their values in the party following the shock resignation.But his departure will be seen as a further strengthening of the grip of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour left on the party.         Mr Johnson was boosted by the intervention from Mr Austin today after officially launching the Tory campaign last night          Tom Watson - who will not be standing at the election - delivered his bombshell news last night after years of bitter infighting with Jeremy Corbyn and his hard-Left acolytesLiz Kendall, who ran against Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2015, said she was \u0027very sad\u0027 to see Mr Watson go.\u0027I will continue to fight for our progressive, social-democratic, pro-European Labour values and know that many other MPs and members will do the same,\u0027 she said.Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said Mr Watson\u0027s resignation was a great loss to the party.\u0027He is a loss, no doubt about it. Tom knows a lot about elections, he is a formidable campaigning force,\u0027 he told ITV\u0027s Peston programme.Some critics of Mr Watson - a committed pro-Remainer - suggested he was quitting because he feared he could be in trouble in his West Bromwich East constituency which voted heavily for Brexit.Mr Watson - who said he intended to focus on public health issues outside Parliament - said he would remain as deputy leader until polling day on December 12 and would be playing an \u0027active part\u0027 in Labour\u0027s election campaign.He was elected to the position in 2015, at the same time as Mr Corbyn was elected leader.During their time together at the top of the party the two men clashed repeatedly, with Mr Watson, a former ally of Gordon Brown, becoming a focus for the \u0027moderate\u0027 opposition in the party to Mr Corbyn.He was publicly critical of the leadership\u0027s attempts to tackle anti-Semitism in the party and led moves to push it into supporting a second referendum on the EU, despite the entrenched resistance of the leader.Most recently, he defied Mr Corbyn by calling for the party to back a new public vote before the country went to the polls in a general election.His opposition to Mr Corbyn angered allies of the Labour leader and on the eve of the Labour Party conference in September, they made an unsuccessful attempt to oust him by abolishing the post of deputy leader.Despite their differences, Mr Corbyn said he was \u0027proud and glad\u0027 to have worked with him over the past four years.In recent months Mr Watson has faced intense criticism over his role in promoting the false claims of a Westminster paedophile ring made by the fantasist Carl Beech.Beech\u0027s allegations led to a number of public figures coming under police investigation, including the former home secretary, the late Lord Brittan of Spennithorne, the former head of the armed forces, Lord Bramall, and ex-Tory MP Harvey Proctor.         Although Mr Watson (pictured with Mr Corbyn in 2016) insisted the decision was \u0027personal not political\u0027, allies made clear that the leadership was a major factorAfter facing calls to resign by some of those involved, he said that he was \u0027very, very sorry\u0027 for the way events had turned out, but stopped short of apologising.Mr Proctor said on Wednesday that he had done his constituents a \u0027great favour\u0027 by standing down.\u0027The next parliament will be a healthier place without him,\u0027 he told the PA news agency.Daniel Janner, the son of the late Labour MP Lord Janner who was one of Beech\u0027s victims, said Mr Watson\u0027s position had become \u0027untenable\u0027.Mr Janner has been a fierce critic of Mr Watson who he has previously accused of applying \u0027pressure on the police\u0027.He said: \u0027Tom Watson whipped up the post-Savile hysteria which damaged falsely accused innocent prominent figures like my late father Lord Janner. His position had become untenable. He has stood down because he would have been defeated. \u0027Mr Watson, who first entered Parliament in 2001, has also spoken openly about his struggles with his health.Last year he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with type-2 diabetes, but had managed to \u0027reverse\u0027 the condition, losing seven stone in weight. "},{"url":null,"title":"Baby Archie beginning CRAWL reveal Harry Meghan","story":"Share this articleKeep it chic like the Duchess in a classic pussy-bow blouseGet the look belowThe Duchess of Sussex looked business-chic   today thanks to her classic ensemble.Meghan teamed a pencil skirt with a white pussy-bow blouse, before finishing off with a pair of stilettos and a khaki cover-up.Classic, smart and timeless, this is a lesson in sophisticated dressing from the royal.

One of these is crowned the word of the year. Climate strike’s definition is “a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change.”The first use of the expression was registered in 2015, when a mass demonstration took place during the UN climate change conference in Paris. However, the phrase only took off in late 2018, when the young Swedish activist Thunberg’s decision to skip school on Fridays in order to protest in front of the national parliament made headlines around the world. In September 2019, an estimated six million people joined the worldwide climate strike, also known as the Global Week for Future.climate strike\u0026nbsp(noun): a form of protest\u0026nbspin which people absent themselves from education or work in order to\u0026nbspjoin\u0026nbspdemonstrations\u0026nbspdemanding action to\u0026nbspcounter\u0026nbspclimate\u0026nbspchange.bopo (noun): a movement\u0026nbspadvocating\u0026nbspthe view that people should be proud\u0026nbspof the appearance of their bodies, or any\u0026nbspaspect\u0026nbspof this, especially size also spelt\u0026nbspBoPo.cancel\u0026nbsp(verb):\u0026nbspto publicly cease to acknowledge a person, organisation, etc, especially on social media, in order to express disapproval of their activities or opinions.deepfake (noun, verb):\u0026nbsp(noun)\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptechnique\u0026nbspby which a\u0026nbspdigital\u0026nbspimage or\u0026nbspvideo\u0026nbspcan be\u0026nbspsuperimposed\u0026nbspon to another, which maintains\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspappearance\u0026nbspof an unedited image or video\u0026nbsp(verb)\u0026nbspto superimpose one digital image or video on to another so that it maintains the appearance of an unedited image or video.double down\u0026nbsp(phrasal verb): to reinforce one’s commitment to a venture or idea in spite of opposition or risk.entryist (noun, adjective):\u0026nbsp(noun)\u0026nbspa person who\u0026nbspjoins\u0026nbspan existing political party with the\u0026nbspintention\u0026nbspof changing its principles and policies (adjective) relating to the practice of\u0026nbspjoining\u0026nbspan existing political party with the\u0026nbspintention\u0026nbspof changing its principles and policieshopepunk\u0026nbsp(noun):\u0026nbspa literary and artistic movement that celebrates the pursuit of positive aims in the face of adversity.influencer (noun):\u0026nbsp a person who uses social media to promote lifestyle choices, commercial products, etc to his or her followers.nonbinary\u0026nbsp(adjective):\u0026nbsprelating to a gender or sexual identity that does not conform to the binary categories of male or female, heterosexual or homosexual also spelt\u0026nbspnon-binary.rewilding\u0026nbsp(noun): the practice of returning areas of land to a wild state, including the reintroduction of animal species that are no longer naturally found there.Collins lexicographers noticed a hundredfold increase in the use of climate strike in 2019, the largest of any word on their list.Helen Newstead, Collins’ language content consultant, said: “Climate strikes can often ide opinion, but they have been inescapable this last year and have even driven a former word of the year – Brexit – from the top of the news agenda, if only for a short time.”The choice shows a trend of new environment-related terms, after 2018’s word of the year, “single-use”, which refers to plastic products made to be used once only.There were other climate-related contenders this year, including “rewilding”, meaning “the practice of returning areas of land to a wild state”, and “hopepunk”, a noun that has been used to describe “a literary and artistic movement that celebrates the pursuit of positive aims in the face of adversity”.Words selected over the last six years have been increasingly political. Where words such as “geek”, “photobomb” and “binge-watching” were once defining new vocabulary, more recent selections include “Brexit” and “fake news”. This year, Collins has launched a “Brexicon”: defining words relating to the Brexit process, including “Brexiteer”, “cakeism”, “flextension” and “prorogue”.“The dictionary has no opinion on Brexit, other than to say it has been quite generous in its gifts to the English language, as well as inspiring the use of many old-fashioned expletives,” said Newstead.“It seems an age since we had more light-hearted words of the year … the politically charged atmosphere of recent years is clearly driving our language, bringing new words to the fore and giving new meanings and nuance to older ones,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0bfccbdd67dd0e5291fa6235bc6575a335350c/0_138_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811581eb7382dc6099ac2dc64851adc5","title":"may at 10 anthony seldon review","story":"Whatever happens in next month’s general election, it is hard to see how Theresa May can win. If Boris Johnson gets a parliamentary majority and is able to force his version of Brexit through, he will be the one who did what she couldn’t, who got the backing of the voters where she failed, who reopened a deal she said was closed, and who seized his moment when she didn’t dare. It will be his victory. On the other hand, if Johnson comes a cropper at the polls and Brexit ends up stymied again, May will go down in the annals of her party as the PM who squandered their best chance to save Brexit and to save themselves. He will be the fall guy. But she will get the ultimate blame.Anthony Seldon’s exhaustive inside account of May’s tenure in Downing Street offers little ammunition for anyone hoping to mount a defence of her premiership. Based on extensive interviews with all the key players (except the PM herself), his book portrays May as a brittle and shallow politician, incurious, inflexible and ultimately out of her depth. She has her moments – he commends her handling of the Salisbury poisonings, for example – but on the whole she comes across as fixed in her views when she needed to be open, yet indecisive when she needed to act: a fatal combination.Some of Seldon’s judgments are withering. He says May should have appreciated the enormous challenges that the referendum result posed for the whole of the UK and the deep difficulty of the choices she faced. “Any knowledge of history would have told her these were not ordinary decisions. But she knew no history.” Seldon calls it “one of the worst failures of imagination and opportunity” by any PM since 1945.She didn’t understand the present either. One of the mysteries of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations was how long it took the UK government to appreciate the intractable problem posed by the Irish border. On Seldon’s account, this was partly down to sheer ignorance on May’s part. “She showed no understanding, because she simply didn’t understand, that it was the EU’s customs union and the single market which made possible the dismantling of the hard border.” You would think someone might have told her. The problem was that she didn’t know how to listen to what she didn’t want to hear.Yet this book is not quite as devastating as it appears, because Seldon’s approach is flawed. By relying so heavily on personal testimony from the people involved, he is essentially trading in post-hoc rationalisations. May at 10 is not so different from Tim Shipman’s All Out War and Fall Out, which cover much of the same ground in even more breathless detail (Seldon occasionally relies on Shipman’s account to fill in gaps in his own). But while Shipman – a journalist – never pretends to be offering anything more than a gossipy tale of back-stabbing and score-settling, Seldon – a historian – wants to be doing something more. So he interposes his own magisterial verdicts on the events he describes. The problem is that it’s not clear where these verdicts come from.For instance, he says that May was right to call an election in 2017 and only has herself to blame for the crushing outcome. He lists six things that went wrong (from the botched manifesto to her timid and robotic behaviour on the campaign trail), and he places ultimate responsibility for each at her door. What’s missing, though, is any sense of the wider political context. Yes, May was a terrible campaigner. But how does Seldon know that the campaign was the root cause of her failure?The truth is that the Tories did not underperform in 2017 – May got roughly the vote share that was predicted by the polls when she called the election and more than any Conservative leader since John Major. What caused all her difficulties was that the opposition vote unexpectedly coalesced around Labour – it was the falling away of Lib Dem, Green and Ukip support that did for her. Could she have prevented that? Maybe she could have been more alive to the risks, but much of what happened – including Labour’s highly effective under-the-radar social media campaign – was out of her hands. Some of her stress during the election came from her sense of her own powerlessness. But Seldon wants to make it all about her.This highly personalised approach means most of the book’s verdicts relate to iniduals and their characters, for better and for worse. Some come out very well. Seldon seems particularly enamoured of Philip May, the PM’s husband, whom he describes as a consort of “consummate skill” and one of the key figures of her entire administration. But he provides very little evidence for what Philip May actually contributed, beyond being loyal and supportive throughout all his wife’s travails. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is some soft sexism at work here – what made it remarkable was that a husband was performing a role we normally associate with prime ministers’ wives.The person who emerges best is Jeremy Heywood, the head of the civil service, whose untimely death in late 2018 robbed the government of its wisest counsellor and safest pair of hands. This judgment is hard to argue with. He was not just consistently helpful, he was also solicitous, notwithstanding some bruising battles with May and her entourage. When the PR disaster of her tin-eared response to the Grenfell fire left her deeply exposed, Heywood texted a fellow official in No 10 to say: “We failed her. We deserve the blame for this, not her.” That others should have been so forgiving.Heywood stabilised May’s administration after the disastrous election result forced her to ditch long-standing special advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. With Heywood’s loss, things began to unravel again and her Brexit strategy lost its way. But May was far from being alone in the misjudgments she made. It’s clear that almost everyone on the UK side miscalculated the likelihood that the EU would buckle under pressure. Equally, the EU’s leading players fundamentally misunderstood how British politics works. Martin Selmayr, chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker and an EU powerbroker in his own right, was astonished to discover that Corbyn did not have May’s mobile number. “I would have expected that the leader of Her Majesty’s opposition and the Prime Minister might speak at least two or three times a week on the phone personally and have a standing communication line to solve this matter.” Really? The British thought the Europeans would behave like them and ditch their guiding principles when the going got tough. The Europeans thought the British would behave like them and stitch up a compromise when they needed one. May might have been tin-eared, but it was a dialogue of the deaf all round.Seldon is interested in the what-ifs of Brexit and he identifies some key moments when it could all have been different, if only one or two people had changed their tune. He says that just before the third and final meaningful vote on May’s deal, Steve Baker of the ERG finally decided to side with the government, potentially bringing enough Brexit diehards with him to get the deal over the line. He went to the office of the DUP’s Nigel Dodds to tell him of his decision, but because Dodds wasn’t there Baker had time to reconsider, and he ended up changing his mind again a few hours later. Seldon remarks: “On such flutters of a butterfly’s wings do great events hinge.” Yet what persuaded Baker to back down was bumping into a couple of his fellow Brexit hardliners who told him he was crazy to back May. So perhaps this butterfly didn’t have quite the influence Seldon thinks.In the end, there probably is no defence of May’s premiership: she was dogged, she was determined, but Seldon is right that she lacked the skills and the knowledge to navigate the Brexit minefield. However, by making it so much about the iniduals concerned – their feuds, their foibles, their resentments and regrets – he does her time in office a disservice. The wider story included many factors beyond any of their power to control. This highly personalised picture of the May years purports to account for the dysfunctional and factional state of current British politics. But it is also a symptom of what it seeks to explain.• Where Power Stops by David Runciman is published by Profile. May at 10 by Anthony Seldon, with Raymond Newell, is published by Biteback (£20).

The shares have since slumped, ing below £4 in August, as sales have fallen.The company has pinned its hopes on a “second century plan” unveiled in 2016, under which it will launch seven new cars in seven years. The Vantage, which costs from £120,900, is the second model in the plan, but sales have been weaker than expected.“We remain pleased with the performance of DB11 and DBS Superleggera, however, the segment of the market in which Vantage competes is declining, and notwithstanding a growing market share, Vantage demand remains weaker than our original plans.“As a consequence, total wholesale volumes are down year on year as we balance growth, brand positioning and dealer inventories. Additionally, we are taking actions to control our costs through an efficiency programme.”The company is preparing for the launch and delivery of DBX, its first SUV, which will be manufactured at its new St Athan factory in south Wales. More than 300 people work at the plant, and the workforce is set to double ahead of the start of production next spring.Aston Martin plans to make up to 5,000 DBXs a year, priced at £158,000 including three years’ servicing. It hopes the model will appeal to multimillionaire women in countries such as China and the US, broadening its traditional male-dominated sports car clientele.Aston Martin said four of its cars will feature in the next James Bond film, out next April: the classic DB5 and V8 Saloon, along with the new DBS Superleggera and Valhalla.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets, said: “It will be hoping a little bit of Bond stardust will rub off on the brand with four Astons going to feature in the next 007 flick. It’s a good chance to showcase the new DBS Superleggera and Valhalla. It needs all the help it can get.”Aston Martin said demand for special vehicles continued to be strong, although fewer had been made. It has delivered six of its most expensive new model, the DB4 GT Zagato Continuation, and a further 13 are to follow by the end of the year. It is sold together with the new 2019 DBS Zagato, for £6m the pair.The DBS GT Zagato, which forms part of the centenary collection, has been unveiled and will be delivered in the second half of next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/791b3c7f3b5480db12a6b5b0cca0e3bb280fe7b4/0_26_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dec6ec6496d1a8374deb26116a11ba8b","title":"london stock exchange considers shorter trading day","story":"Lobby groups have called for European exchanges to open an hour later to reduce the strain on mental and physical healthThe London Stock Exchange is to consider lopping 90 minutes of the trading day in a bid to improve mental health and attract more women and working parents to a high-pressure environment known for gruelling hours.The LSE made the announcement after City lobby groups sent a letter to nine exchanges, including Germany’s Deutsche Boerse and the Amsterdam-headquartered Euronext, urging them to adopt the proposal.The Investment Association, which represents City firms that have £7.7tn in assets under management, and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), said that the 812-hour European trading day was one of the longest in the world but did not deliver “material benefits to savers, investors or firms”. In Asia, the trading day is usually six hours, and in the US it is 6.5hrs.The lobby groups said shorter hours would improve market structure and have “a significant positive impact on inidual employees and … our industry’s ability to attract a more erse talent”. The London Stock Exchange is open between 8am and 4.30pm, while other equity markets across Europe follow the same opening and closing hours on local time. The IA estimates that the average trader works around 60 hours a week, as extra time is put in before and after the trading day to prepare and then finalise trades. “The addition of commuting time only exacerbates this problem. Anyone with family commitments is less likely to be willing or able to spend such long hours in the office,” the lobby groups said.AFME and the IA said the lengthy hours were also putting a strain on workers’ mental health. “The physical drag on inidual staff is also significant. Staff are habitually doing a 10-hour working session at their desk in an industry where lunch breaks are often still frowned upon. This is not conducive to good mental and physical health.”A compressed trading day would also make markets more efficient, as trading activity tends to be weak at the start of the session and jumps at the market close, the groups said. A London Stock Exchange Group spokesperson said: “We strongly support improving ersity and workplace culture across the City … We intend to consider the request in a formal consultation with London Stock Exchange’s global members and customers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42ad49bba184bac9a5160fb14abaf3802882ec54/0_6_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b7e61a36a66b56e11815c2740e7f9f","title":"divided cities inside the new documentary series from guardian cities","story":"Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more ided than ever. From today and for the next four weeks, our international film series will tell the stories of five cities that reflect these isions in surprising and troubling waysThirty years ago, a rapt world watched the unfolding of one of the great city stories of all time. Every hammer blow chipping away the imposing grey blocks of the Berlin Wall, which had come to embody global geopolitical isions, seemed to herald a more united future.Since then, however, our world has fractured anew and our cities feel more ided than ever. When the Berlin Wall fell, there were two border walls in Europe now there are 15. Nor is this fracture merely physical: many cities are havens of wealth and privilege for those who hold the access codes, hives of struggle and poverty for those who do not. Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.When we started  Cities in 2014, many of the stories we reported, on topics such as gentrification and car use, were ultimately about ision and inequality – and that was before the votes for Donald Trump and for Brexit upended the US and UK, the war in Syria sparked an unprecedented migration crisis, and climate change finally seized the imagination of those who realised that it was likely to be the poor who suffered most.Divided Cities is the result of that reckoning – a new global documentary series of five stories, from five cities around the world, that reflect these major faultlines in surprising and troubling ways.Over the last 12 months our team –  executive producer Jess Gormley, producer Anetta Jones, film-maker Max Duncan and myself – worked with our contacts around the world to identify what we believe to be some of the more vital and startling ways cities are ided today. All we knew at first was that we wanted to move beyond Trump and Brexit – both of which have sucked up so much oxygen that many equally important stories are going unreported – and to rethink ision from a fresh perspective.That meant avoiding some quite well-covered cities: the “peace walls” of Belfast, for example, or the famously ided city of Jerusalem, a place as thick with history as it is with journalists. It also meant moving on from certain well-trodden urban inequalities such as gentrification or the conflict between cyclists and drivers, which, though emotive flashpoints, are issues we have covered (and will continue to cover) in dozens of different ways.Instead, the stories that jumped out to us came from five continents and embodied five entirely different conceptions of what it means to be a “ided city”. We started in Nicosia with a classic of the genre, as it were: the UN-patrolled barricade that cleaves the island of Cyprus into a mostly Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. The story that seized us most strongly there, however, was new: a young generation who didn’t experience the war, and who reject the military conscription that requires them to point guns at their friends across what is now an shabby, overgrown buffer zone.In Africa, meanwhile, we were fortunate enough to be present on the ground for one the most dramatic, dangerous and daring events in the world’s ongoing migration crisis: a night-time climb of the border fence at Melilla. Along with Ceuta, Melilla is a truly unusual city – a Spanish outpost in north Africa, separated from Morocco by a fence. Hundreds of people, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, end their treacherous journeys across the desert by hiding out in forest camps near the fence, waiting for the right moment – sometimes as long as six months – to try to climb en masse in the dead of night. In May this year, one attempt saw almost 60 migrants make it over. They stepped on to EU soil, claiming asylum. But the far-right political party Vox wants them out, and is proposing two ideas that will sound troublingly familiar: to “make Spain great again” by building, you guessed it, a wall. It’s a closed-door attitude that makes no provision for another quirk of this fascinating city: 30,000 people cross through the fence daily for work, but who must return to Morocco each night. Many work as “porters”, exploiting a legal grey area that allows them to carry goods tax-free. The trade is tolerated by the authorities, and the economic benefits it brings are relied on by both Melillans and Moroccans.Other cities lack physical barriers entirely, but are no less split. The socialist capital of Havana boasts a truly bizarre system of two currencies: one for the socialist state sector, which pays the salaries of doctors and other civil servants and one for the newly booming private sector, which is pegged to the US dollar and is worth 24 times the state currency. This oddity leads to some obscene ironies, such as doctors earning so little that they can’t afford to feed their own families, leading some to abandon their training and communities and take up unrelated private sector roles, such as driving taxis for tourists.The very wealth of the United States to the north, meanwhile, generates equally perverse schisms. One of the worst of the country’s so-called “food deserts” is in Memphis, Tennessee, where many neighbourhoods lack what seems a basic right in richer neighbourhoods – a supermarket. For poorer residents, most of whom don’t own cars, that either means long journeys on multiple buses, or feeding your kids junk from fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, where much of what is sold as food doesn’t truly qualify for the name.Finally, if there is one unfolding phenomenon that unites us all in ision, so to speak, it is the environmental crisis, rapidly shaping up to be the greatest inequality issue we are likely to face as a species. As India’s capital, Delhi, grows dark under a cloud of smog that refuses to dissipate, following a summer where more than a hundred Delhi residents died as a direct result of overheating, we found a city riven by “climate apartheid”. Some can afford to protect themselves from the elements (via cars, air purifiers, and air conditioned spaces). Others must live, work, suffer and sometimes die in the heat and pollution.None of these isions is carved in stone. In each city, we found irrepressible people who don’t just passively accept their fate. The young Nicosians willing to face prison rather than take up arms against other teenagers on the opposite side of the ide. The migrants to Melilla who lift each other to better lives, and the Spanish citizens who help them to keep Spain a welcoming country.

As Maya Angelou put it: “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.” Here was a confession, an insight into a worldview steeped in a sense of class privilege and social superiority. We don’t need to read between the lines: the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has done it for us. When the BBC’s Evan Davis put it to him that Rees-Mogg was effectively saying: “I wouldn’t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade’s advice,” Bridgen did not demur, adding – after a sigh-filled pause – “But we want very clever people running the country, don’t we, Evan? … That’s a byproduct of what Jacob is, that’s why he is in a position of authority.”Leave aside that the Grenfell disaster itself was an indictment of a rotten social order that values money over people’s lives. Here, in the minds of Rees-Mogg and Bridgen, is a world in which the masses are feeble, ignorant, simple-minded, requiring leadership by their supposed social betters who are, quite literally, born to rule. If Rees-Mogg is indeed “very clever”, it needs more proof than pretentious smatterings of Latin phrases recalled from Eton, and there it is lacking. Accusations of “class warfare” have always been a staple Tory attack line, normally when confronted with calls to more equitably tax wealth and income. But to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war while the other vigorously fights it. While other Tories may choose their words more carefully, the attitude underpinning Rees-Mogg’s and Bridgen’s words are a feature, not a bug, of their party. Without a sense of social superiority, there would be no Toryism.Indeed, Tories have often been as candid as Rees-Mogg is himself. Labour’s birth as a mass political force had much to do with an infamous court ruling. The Taff Vale legal judgment of 1901 made trade unions liable for profits lost in strikes, effectively rendering industrial action impossible and underlining the need for unions to have parliamentary representation. The future Tory prime minister Stanley Baldwin later admitted: “The Conservatives can’t talk of class war. They started it.” When Britain’s last general strike, in 1926, ended in defeat for the trade union movement, the former Tory prime minister Arthur Balfour sneered: “The general strike has taught the working class more in four days than years of talking could have done.”Back in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s right-hand man Keith Joseph – a pioneer of market fundamentalism who was later dubbed “the Mad Monk” – ruined his Tory leadership chances by making the mistake of saying what he truly thought. He argued that more and more children “are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world and bring them up. They are born to mothers who were first pregnant in adolescence in social classes 4 and 5 … Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment.” His final line – “The balance of our population, our human stock is threatened” – outed his eugenicist bigotry in its all its ugliness: that the ill-educated poor would out-breed their social superiors.As the daughter of a shopkeeper, Margaret Thatcher herself is frequently portrayed as a challenge to the old Tory toffs, but her snobbery was no less great. As one shadow cabinet minister told the ’s Hugo Young on the eve of her 1979 electoral triumph: “She is still basically a Finchley lady. Her view of the world is distressingly narrow. She regards the working class as idle, deceitful, inferior and bloody-minded.” Even supposed liberal Tories such as Michael Heseltine believed in the rule of those with privilege over those who did not, even if they believed that rule should be benevolent. He believed in “good enlightened capitalism – paternalism if you like,” as he once put it. “Noblesse oblige. I believe strongly that those with power and privilege have responsibilities.”Fear of, and contempt towards, working-class people is an unbroken thread in Tory history. Take the revelation by Nick Clegg that the Tory leadership once told him: “I don’t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing – it just creates Labour voters.” Indeed, it reflected a traditional Tory aim: that a sense of solidarity – that the majority should use their collective power to force concessions from the powerful – was innately subversive, and needed to be replaced by an everyone-for-themselves inidualism. “It’s not the existence of classes that threatens the unity of the nation,” as one official Conservative party document put it in 1976, “but the existence of class feeling.” In other words, even to discuss social class meant asking searching questions about why some have wealth and power that go beyond believing that those at the top somehow deserved to be there.It is this worldview that underpins so many policy assumptions. Taxes should be slashed for the rich, because they amassed their wealth through their superior talents and hard efforts. The welfare state should be rolled back, because it merely incentivises the fecklessness and aversion to work that exists among the poor. It is even the rationale used to argue that buildings burn and kill dozens of predominantly working-class people not because flammable cladding was chosen because it was cheaper, or because fire sprinklers weren’t in place because that costs money, but because the victims lacked common sense or leadership skills.It is this sense of class chauvinism that led, in part, to Grenfell – because who truly thinks that if the tower was full of luxury apartments filled with City slickers and hedge-fund managers that this would have ever happened? So, let’s not dismiss Rees-Mogg’s utterances as gaffes. This is how they see the world: it is the very foundation of their politics. As the Tories pin their election hopes on working-class communities in the North and Midlands, this eternal truth needs to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b78efb1798c0b0e0ac1e14f691be568b8bf7c6ce/0_236_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83331d7a5941dec466c65231e8c6b86","title":"german health minister migration patriotism","story":"When I was growing up in the 1990s, the liberal order was unquestioned. The US and Europe were home to stable liberal democracies they were the role models worth aspiring to for the entire world. Today, I am the health minister in Angela Merkel’s government and I’m deeply concerned about the destabilisation of our societies. The biggest threats to our democracies are not external challengers like China or Russia. They are our internal frictions and isions.The situation throughout western societies is very similar: our debates have turned hostile. We have broken into ever-smaller groups people dehumanise their opponents. We are too concerned about what might separate us instead of what unites us. Loyalties seem to lie with one’s political tribe only. The results are fragmentation, polarisation and mutual hate. Internal cohesion is eroding, the capacity for international cooperation is diminishing.Polarisation unfolds along economic and cultural cleavages. In the UK and Germany, many have benefited economically from free trade, while others have not. In both countries some citizens embrace a cosmopolitan society, while others crave regional anchors of identity.The most salient political issues are wealth redistribution and migration. Our strong welfare states lessen the economic polarisation to some extent. But this also leads to a prominent link between migration and redistribution: uncontrolled immigration into the welfare state can lead to support for redistribution mechanisms going down altogether. Even Milton Friedman once said that open borders are incompatible with a welfare state. So, our migration debates are very contested.Essentially, both debates are about identity. Two groups have formed. One deems western democracies responsible for global inequalities. They call for permeable borders to let less-developed world regions participate more directly in western wealth. They embrace a erse and cosmopolitan society. The others feel threatened by social change as it questions their economic status and cultural anchors of identity. They call for stronger border regimes and a clearly defined national identity. The nation is a shelter in a fast-changing world.In our multi-party system, big tent parties in the political centre can bridge these isions. My party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), traditionally united progressive and conservatives. I am convinced that this is the most noble task for all democratic parties.I am also fully convinced that erse societies must not fragment based on age, gender, sexuality, origin, race or religion. Quite the contrary: precisely because our societies grow more erse, we need a unifying narrative bridging our supposed differences. The answer to ersity is not more tales about differences, but stories about commonalities. Our nations are the home we build together.We Germans see patriotism more sceptically than those in the UK. The reasons are the atrocities the Nazis brought to Europe in the name of the German nation. Just seeing our national flag at party conventions creates an iffy feeling for many Germans.Our patriotism will always be much more cautious than its British counterpart. We will always commemorate the shadows of our past and remain firmly committed to European integration. However, a shared sense of belonging of all citizens within liberal democracies requires the emotional framework of the nation state. To find a common identity bridging cosmopolitan and regional identities, I propose a weltoffener patriotismus. Weltoffen is tricky to translate into English. It roughly means being open-minded towards the world, open to new ideas and cultures. Weltoffener patriotismus does not make isions based on ethnicity, but defines clear premises based on which everybody can join. If a nation is the home we build together, weltoffener patriotismus offers the foundation that everybody agreeing on a set of rules can stand on.How does that translate into policy? As minister of health I am the only minister in my party, the CDU, dealing with welfare state issues. And health and nursing are key symbols of national unity because how we treat the sick and the elderly typifies how we define national solidarity.Germany is ageing rapidly. We need skilled migration to fill the gaps in our health and nursing sector and seek professionals from abroad. We are signing international agreements with Mexico, the Philippines and Kosovo. These countries boast many well-educated youngsters struggling to find a job who we want to invite to work in Germany. We are setting up a German agency for international healthcare professionals (GAP) to facilitate their transition.A conservative minister championing migration might sound odd. However, this is my understanding of weltoffener patriotismus. Our message to the people of Mexico, the Philippines and all other nations is: if you share our values and want to work with us, please feel cordially invited. Our message to the citizens of Germany reads: we can be proud of our free society, our values and cultures and national achievements. Not least of those made together with Germans whose parents and grandparents were born elsewhere.The immigration of international professionals in the health and nursing sector is of benefit to migrants and Germans. It follows transparent procedures and is controlled by state agencies. It is embedded in government efforts to increase the pay and working conditions in the health and nursing sector so Germans do not feel pressures on their wages. At the same time, compulsory language acquisition and integration courses aim for a smooth transition into the German society.We do not only aspire to fill the gap in our health and nursing sector but to also address the search for a unifying identity. Certainly, controlled skilled migration and thorough integration into society is only one step. But it exemplifies how to deal with emotional issues in a less polarising way: not focusing on erging interests but on shared values not separating groups, but bringing them together. Because we can be weltoffen and patriotic at the same time.• Jens Spahn is the German minister for health"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60a30cffa67576a1115b780e7ce6a5b9ac31ff0d/0_10_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58ef4292147dbfacdebdda1db4a95398","title":"manifesto for the north message positive change election","story":"Never before has an entire English region united to call for change. We’re asking for the power to do more for ourselves• Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater ManchesterThe UK is both the most politically centralised and regionally unbalanced country in the OECD. That was the finding of Bob Kerslake’s UK2070 commission earlier this year.These two depressing facts are intrinsically linked. If you concentrate politicians and civil servants in one part of the country, it is unsurprising that they will make decisions that favour that place over others. And if people in other places feel they have no real means of challenging this injustice, it is unsurprising that they will come to feel alienated from a political system that neglects where they live.This is the backdrop to the 2019 general election. The Brexit debate is real, but it is also a proxy for a much deeper dissatisfaction with our politics, which has been brewing for decades. A system that rewards parties for focusing on a small number of key marginals rather than the fortunes of whole regions is, by definition, dysfunctional.So far, this election appears to be following the usual pattern. We have seen certain lucky towns hand-picked for visits and government funding, but little mention of the north-south ide that has been widening for decades.This is now dangerous. An election campaign pitting “the people” against parliament could easily take the country to an even darker place and unleash unfocused anger unless, alongside the Brexit discussion, it quickly gets into a much more positive debate about real solutions to the loss of trust in our political system, and the serious reforms needed to rebalance our country economically and socially. This election desperately needs to be a change election for the north of England. So far I’m not feeling it – but I hope that’s about to change.Thursday brings a general election intervention truly without precedent. Never before has an entire English region united across geographical and political ides to call for change.The publication of the first Manifesto for the North, resulting from the recent Convention of the North, simply can’t be ignored. It is a positive intervention into an otherwise highly ided political debate. It sets out the terms for a new political settlement, around which all political parties can and should unite, and upon which a badly ided nation might begin to heal in the long term. Crucially, it asks the government to make rebalancing the economy a formal HM Treasury objective, to deliver transformational investment for the north. In the past, it has been all too easy for talk of the north-south ide to be labelled “northern whinging” and relegated to the margins of national political debate. But that won’t be possible this time. First, our “power up the north” call, championed by our newspapers, is a positive, self-confident ask for the power to do more for ourselves, rather than just a plea for resources. Second, it is backed by heavyweight analysis from a commission led by the former head of the UK civil service, Lord Kerslake, which has found that the north-south ide in England today is as stark as the east-west ide in Germany in the early 1990s.To many people here, that gets to the heart of the matter. It has always felt that we live in two different countries. The most obvious example is transport. The transport system in the north, which runs on Victorian infrastructure, feels as though it belongs to a different era and country to the one that operates in London and the south east. But the great transport ide is not just down to infrastructure. It also runs to different rules or, in the case of our buses, no rules at all.Westminster’s decision to deregulate bus services everywhere except London in the 80s has left people in the north paying more for a poorer service. A single bus journey here can cost £4 compared with £1.50 in the capital. Vital routes can be cut on a whim.Given the north’s lower-wage economy, it has always been the case that communities have had a higher need for social housing than elsewhere. It therefore follows that the government’s right-to-buy policy and curbs on councils building replacement homes have hit the north harder. When you add on top of that the cuts to benefits over the last decade – and in particular the freeze on the local housing allowance, which helps people afford homes in the private-rented sector – you can see how the hellish conditions described by the Manchester Evening News’s Jennifer Williams have come about.The Manifesto for the North confronts this reality of life in the north today. It seeks to free us from the shackles of short-sighted Westminster policies on transport and housing, and give us the power to solve these things for ourselves.At a time when our politicians can barely agree on anything, devolution of power to the English regions is perhaps the only big idea in politics uniting people across the political spectrum. For that reason alone, it must be embraced.• Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4751e816670e72ae0f719a5a4875f3b0a512780/0_33_3265_1958/master/3265.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=3b07fcddc34546f634e6e9a48309a165","title":"majority of uk public back 2030 zero carbon target poll","story":"A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests.The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support.Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind.Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, the Green party also has a target date of 2030, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045.Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month’s vote was becoming the UK’s first “climate election”.“The figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,” he said.Yule said only Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution plans – which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes – would address the scale of the crisis.“Not even Conservative voters support the Tories’ net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,” he added.“A target date of 2030 has been Green party policy for years,” said a Green party spokesperson. “The fact that the majority of people now support it shows how much concern about the climate emergency is accelerating, and how little support there is for the government’s policy of setting targets for mid-century and using that as an excuse to take very little action to achieve them.”This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders’ debate on the climate. All agreed except for Boris Johnson, who did not respond.Noga Levy-Rapoport, a participant in the youth climate strikes, said: “This general election is our last chance to face up to the climate crisis. The public clearly support the most ambitious targets to decarbonise.“Parties should respond in kind by offering a Green New Deal which rapidly reduces emissions while improving living standards and expanding services like free bus travel.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

But with only six words in his latest film, Anna Paquin’s moral spectre is a sign of a troubling trend in HollywoodWhen Anna Paquin joined the cast of Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, it seemed like a decent break for the actor who has flown under the radar since her days as the half-vampire Sookie Stackhouse on True Blood. Paquin’s was the only big female name alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and a myriad of other recognisable male stars – an anomaly that held the promise of a particularly meaty female role (if Scorsese’s gangster flicks serve as evidence).But even though The Irishman never suggests it would prominently feature its female characters, few could have anticipated quite how absent its most important female figure is.Played by Paquin as an adult woman and Lucy Gallina as a child, Peggy Sheeran is the daughter of De Niro’s hitman, Frank Sheeran. A practically mute, moral spectre judging her father’s criminal lifestyle from the sidelines, she appears only a handful of times – less than 10 minutes in total. The Irishman’s narrative revolves around Frank’s imperfect recollections of when he first became involved with the Italian mafia in his 40s through to his present day in a nursing home. Within these boundaries, Peggy is disconcertingly diminished: Paquin speaks six words in a movie that clocks in at three-and-a-half hours. There may be a potency to such intentional restraint within the film’s elegiac trappings, yet circumscribing Peggy as Frank’s moral conscience remains doggedly frustrating. Is she more of a symbol than an actual person?While not exactly gender progressive, Scorsese’s testosterone-fuelled gangster movies have carved out provocative roles for women. Take, for example, Lorraine Bracco’s complicit mob wife in Goodfellas. Along with her protagonist husband, Henry, Bracco’s Karen Hill is given the narrative space to air her grievances and articulate her desires in stretches of voiceover narration – helping to outline the private and public consequences of Henry’s criminal enterprise. Ginger in Casino, meanwhile, may fit too neatly into the femme fatale archetype, but Sharon Stone’s physically committed performance – from poised hustler to woman on the edge, brought down by addiction and avarice – is one of the film’s memorable elements.But Paquin’s Peggy is markedly different from the female roles of Scorsese gangster films past she is more a tool for expressing the protagonist’s moral blindness, and a vehicle that primes audiences to feel certain ways about other characters, rather than a fully drawn person. As a child, Peggy learns to avoid her father after witnessing a brutal episode that demonstrates his capacity for violence. She openly disdains his shady friend and employer, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), whom she understands on some instinctive level is a villain and her father’s corruptor she rebuffs his attempts to win her favour with Christmas cash and ice skates. Instead, Peggy prefers the company of impassioned and personable labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and his warm, if flawed, paternal instincts.As an adult, Peggy’s taciturn presence is an implicit condemnation of the film’s degraded masculine worldview. The nail in the coffin of Peggy and Frank’s relationship is Paquin’s only spoken line in the film, a six-word question that has Peggy confronting her father after his act of betrayal.Paquin’s comically low line-count is reminiscent of criticism of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why was Margot Robbie, an Academy Award-nominated actress, given so much less dialogue than her male counterparts? The question was not unwarranted. After all, Robbie’s Sharon Tate is the beating heart of Quentin Tarantino’s unexpectedly tender tale of historical revisionism. The suggestion that Tarantino short-shrifted Robbie spawned a debate that lasted through the summer. Is Tarantino’s Tate an objectified male fantasy? Or is she a triumphantly humanised depiction of a woman whose legacy has been defined by the tragic circumstances of her death? Are the women in Tarantino’s dude-heavy films empowered or problematically rendered? In any case, women in The Irishman are moral reminders and checks on an inward looking all-male reality. So much of The Irishman’s final act has us yearning for Peggy’s final thoughts, for Paquin to take the stage once and for all in some sort of cathartic fashion. But we get no such closure, condemned like Frank to a dreary purgatory of what could have been. Perhaps Scorsese too readily buys into the symbolic potency of women as moral beacons. Peggy’s role is trimmed to a sliver of silent glances by the blinkered, perhaps repressed memories of her aged father – an easy cop-out for reducing her significance to mere phantom guilt trip with feminine charms.If Scorsese’s filmography has taught us anything, it’s that women are too often caught in the crosshairs of the world of men, whether as victims or cunning culprits, as jezebels or slaves to love. But in opting out of her father’s world, Peggy contextualises the heartlessness and cruelty of the like-minded men (and women) who have so long fascinated the film-maker. Instead, Peggy gestures at an alternative, which strikes me as more than the disgruntled rejection of “daddy’s little girl”, rather hinting at an entire generational disenchantment. If only she were given the flesh and bones to fully bring to life this subtle revolutionary element."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d328d0b56cb653ec090661473fe5a1d100b30983/263_0_3154_1894/master/3154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfda2b9d34425afa1db38364098d58c1","title":"why martin scorseses the irishman wont be coming to a cinema near you","story":"Major cinemas around the world are not screening the film, whose early Netflix release date they see as an existential threatIf there was ever a sign that cinema-going was becoming a niche experience, it must be that a major feature directed by one of the godfathers of modern film will grace only a handful of big screens around the world.Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is not the first likely blockbuster to bypass wide theatrical release before heading to the binge-box of home entertainment, but it is perhaps the most notable – and it’s sparked a coordinated response from cinema operators internationally, who see the rise of the streaming giants as an existential threat.The $159m film and passion project for Scorsese was financed by Netflix after years of languishing in development. The director wrote in the New York Times earlier this week that Netflix “alone allowed us to make The Irishman the way we needed to”. But when it came time to broker a deal with distributors for theatrical release, parties couldn’t agree.Traditionally, cinemas have demanded a 90-day window between theatrical release and on-demand availability, essentially giving them the first exclusive bite of the revenue pie. But negotiations between the NetflixScorsese team and two major US cinema chains, AMC Theatres and Cineplex, fell apart earlier this year when Netflix reportedly wanted that window closed to 45 days at most.Other major cinema chains in the UK and Europe followed suit. The Irishman is reported to have opened in only eight cinemas in New York and Los Angeles. The trend has also spread to Australia, where the only cinemas to be showing the film will be “independent” chains such as Dendy and Classic cinemas – companies that have a stronger market in niche fare than major multiplexes like Village and Hoyts.The Irishman is not the only film to have broken the 90-day rule. Last year’s Oscar-winning Roma, for example, had a three-week run in cinemas before becoming available on Netflix. But whether due to the auteur’s prestige or whether cinemas have hit peak frustration at streaming services’ encroachment on traditional box office revenue, the bite-back from the industry has been sharp.Last week, the president of the US cinema industry association, John Fithian, called the outcome of the negotiations in the US a “disgrace”.“Netflix is facing a challenge to their business model for the first time and missed a strategic opportunity,” he told the Hollywood Reporter.“The point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit The Irishman’s theatrical release,” he said. “They sent a signal to filmmakers that even if you’re Martin Scorsese, you won’t get the wide theatrical release you want through Netflix.”His Australian counterpart, David Seargeant, chairman of the National Association of Cinema Operators (NACO), told Inside Film in October: “Several exhibitors, who are not our members, are taking a short-term view and showing films without an appropriate theatrical season.”If it’s preferable for films funded by streaming companies to go straight to the home, why bother with theatrical release at all? Part of the answer is acclaim: eligibility for major accolades such as the Academy Awards is still tied to first release in cinema. There’s also an aesthetic consideration: films made for TV are structurally different to those made for the proportions of a cinema screen. And for the right films, extraordinary profits can still be made from those public showings – as Marvel, and its parent company Disney, have shown.Scorsese’s recent comments about the lack of “revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger” of those massive Marvel films – opinions he first expressed in October – were accompanied by a more general lamentation about the state of cinema today.“Every new Hitchcock picture was an event. To be in a packed house in one of the old theatres watching Rear Window was an extraordinary experience: It was an event created by the chemistry between the audience and the picture itself, and it was electrifying,” Scorsese wrote, while simultaneously acknowledging that filmmakers like himself were hamstrung between wanting to make films for that collective, aesthetic experience of the theatre, while also being required to follow the funding.It’s a justification some smaller cinema operators, many of whom aren’t members of the industry association NACO, have made for showing Netflix’s films, despite the bigger players showing a united front. Australian indie chain Dendy, for example, plans to release other Netflix films – including The King, Marriage Story and The Two Popes – ahead of their on-demand release, despite many of them breaking the 90-day window.“Consumers want to see niche and alternative content on our cinema screens,” says Scott Mota from Dendy, explaining their decision to screen the films. But it’s a decision they might not always be able to make. Once the 90-day window breaks and the precedent is set for shorter theatrical runs, cinemas fear their box office takings will suffer – and so will the chances of many more films making it to the big screen at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbfc33272adfb39ee0a6de74bd7f486a018ef8c2/0_126_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a06c4ba3950bfae5c7ba8f7c860582","title":"why am i happy to spend 20 on four pints of beer but not on a bottle of wine","story":"We all have strange rules about what we will and won’t splash out on. Blame the way we were brought up – and our fear of deathBefore the financial crash, people used to explain behavioural economics with the example of the rich man mowing his lawn. “Why are you doing that boring task when you’re so minted?” the hypothetical economist would ask him. “Because it costs £10 to get your lawn mowed.” “OK. If I give you a tenner, will you mow my lawn?” “Of course not.” Money, far from being a fixed, fungible quantity, changes value depending on how you feel about what you’re spending it on. After the crash, “behavioural” got to be shorthand for “Why did all those people behave so crazy?” But actually the pre-crash question – “Why are some tenners worth more than others?” – was more interesting.Nowhere is this more obvious than with food and drink. I will think nothing, for instance, of having two pints with my mister on an average midweek evening, which is (quick maths) four pints, or 20 quid. I would no more buy a £20 bottle of wine on a Wednesday than I would go to Hawaii for a mini-break. I don’t mind at all going out for a fancy kebab irrespective of whether or not it’s my birthday, yet when a butcher casually lifted £5.95 off me for a lamb shank, I was still talking about it days later (I’m still talking about it now). I would never look at the cost of a main course and think: “How was it possible to get to 17 quid for a mackerel?” – I merely accept the restaurant’s decision. Yet the tag on side dishes sets off my daylight-burglar alarm: £4.50 for spring greens? No, really though. There had better be a tonne of them. At those prices, I want enough spring greens to put me off spring.Many concepts of value are locked down in childhood, so I think of a steak as barely a domestic food at all, instead a biannual event for when something exceptionally good or bad has happened. I will make meringues rather than throw away an egg white, casually pouring away two hours of relatively concentrated effort for the sake of 36p, tops. I balk at the price of orange juice, but I have no problem spending four times as much on a kombucha drink because it’s there. Fermentation wasn’t a thing in the 80s, unless you were talking about home brewing. I have no mind map for whether or not it’s a ripoff – I just want to see if it’s tasty.Put a takeaway menu in front of me and there is no limit to the amount of prawn toast I can afford. Spending £70 getting someone to arrive at the front door with a meal for five seems completely reasonable. Would I pay a person £50, though, to arrive and cook £20 worth of ingredients for us? What do you take me for – Rupert Murdoch?Money arguments in relationships are often proxy battles over more important things such as love, power and control. Food-money is a proxy for smaller conflicts. So my beloved hates it when I use finishing salt where table salt would do, and he says: “Are you using my salt in pasta water?” And I go: “How is this your salt? How about these scissors? Are they your scissors or our scissors?” And I hate it when he bulk-buys high-effort food items, since it triggers some pre-verbal feminist defence mechanism against the possibility that my time has been appropriated by the patriarchy. And maybe you will side with him on that, and suggest that he was intending to cook them himself. But you’re not the one with four rabbits and 24 kippers in your freezer.And finally, there’s mortality: food can make you forget you’re mortal. You see a Creme Egg or a blackberry and it reminds you that, whatever happens, Easter will reappear and so will autumn, that you are in a world of perpetual renewal and if you hitch your destiny to the Creme Egg, you too can live for ever. I will drop a fortune on samphire just because I’m pleased to see its time come round again. In the same way, hatred of throwing away food isn’t really about the waste, and it definitely isn’t about the cost – it’s about fighting the horrifying truth that, whatever your best intentions, everything must perish and the march of decay is relentless. In practice, though, this means keeping tiny bowls of grated carrot that cost less than a mouthful of espresso and eating yoghurt that is a full month out of date and daring it to fizz.I tried to persuade my kid the other day that an Actimel she had left in her school bag was OK and, when she opened it, it exploded all over both of us. This will be laid down in family lore as evidence of my outrageous tightness, but that’s not what it is. Food is its own currency, as emotional as the lira, as stubborn as the deutschmark, as up-on-its-dignity as the pound. Sorry for the 20th-century analogies, but there it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5dd58b7b40e7eaabe0e2603db6e70910fc31829/0_95_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31f742fe3013263e337a76b07acf43b1","title":"arsene wenger not decided going back management bayern munich football","story":"• Wenger has not yet spoken to Bayern but would ‘never refuse to’• He has been out of management since leaving Arsenal in 2018Arsène Wenger maintains he is not in discussions with Bayern Munich about their managerial vacancy – but admits he faces a “difficult decision” about a return to the dugout and would “never refuse” to talk to the German club.The 70-year-old former Arsenal manager is reported to be high on Bayern’s wanted list as they look for a replacement for Niko Kovac, who was sacked following the 5-1 thrashing by Eintracht Frankfurt.The Bundesliga club are said to be looking at a deal to bring the Frenchman to the Allianz Arena until the end of the season, with former Juventus boss Max Allegri another name in the frame. Wenger is also considering a job offer from Fifa, but any such role would not prevent him from completing a return to management.He said: “I have not decided yet if I will go back on the pitch or not. I am quite happy at what I do. I miss the pitch as well, so it is a difficult decision for me at the moment. I will make that decision in the coming days or the coming week.”Wenger, who had been close to joining the German side earlier in his coaching career, has been working as a pundit for beIN Sports and was in the studio to help analyse Bayern Munich’s Champions League win over Olympiakos on Wednesday night.Asked about the reports he was now willing to talk to the German club, Wenger said: “I never refuse to talk to Bayern Munich because I know these people who lead the club for 30 years. I was nearly going to Bayern a long, long time ago. At the moment, that is all I can say.Pressed if he would be open to an approach from Bayern, Wenger replied: “I always talk – in fact I talk a lot here, I wonder why!”The veteran Frenchman has been out of football since leaving the Gunners during May 2018 after 22 years with the Premier League club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd3a92e9b5c074751ef3c4996d506621b58faf0/0_44_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05c64d619d6451f78acd6305d15be479","title":"football transfer rumours emmanuel dennis to leicester city","story":"Not content with all the praise being lavished on his exciting Leicester side as they chase a top-four finish, Brendan Rodgers is hoping to earn even more by bringing in several January recruits. Emmanuel Dennis is a 21-year-old striker currently plying his trade at Belgian outfit Club Brugge and made headlines by scoring a brace against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu just over a month ago. Rodgers is an admirer and hopes to bring him to the Premier League. Real Sociedad central defender Diego Llorente is also inching his way across the Leicester radar, while Tottenham and West Ham are also in the race to secure the £45m-rated 26-year-old’s scrawl.Wolfsburg striker Wout Weghorst is wanted by Crystal Palace, who are finding goals hard to come by despite their position in the top half of the table. Averaging less than a goal per game, Jordan Ayew is currently their top scorer with three, while Christian Benteke has scored just twice for his club since April 2018.With the future of Granit Xhaka at Arsenal in doubt following all that recent unpleasantness, AC Milan could offer the Swiss international a fresh start, if reports from Italy are to be believed. Stripped of the captaincy by Unai Emery, Xhaka has stopped short of apologising for his angry reaction to being jeered, scapegoated and bullied by the entitled masses at the Emirates while being subbed off during his most recent appearance for the club.Increasingly surplus to requirements at Chelsea due to the emergence of various prominent members of Lampard Youth, the days of old-timers Pedro, Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud at Stamford Bridge are looking numbered. Turkish side Fenerbahçe are interested in taking Pedro, who has also attracted interest from the Chinese Super League. Giroud, who has made no secret of his displeasure at the lack of first team action he’s been given this season, is understood to have admirers at Crystal Palace and West Ham, but could also make a triumphant return to France. Following his half-time withdrawal against Ajax, who targeted him with great success on Tuesday night, Alonso could also find himself looking for new employers, not least because Emerson has finally returned from the treatment room after six weeks out.Manchester United are keeping tabs on Burnley midfielder Dwight McNeil, who they had on their books as a kid only to let him go when he was 14. Having watched the midfielder develop into one of the Premier League’s most exciting homegrown talents under Sean Dyche, they will have to pay the thick end of £40m to bring him back to Old Trafford.And finally, the delightful prospect of seeing Arséne Wenger gadding about in Lederhosen and a Tyrolean hat while supping frothy lager from a stein seems increasingly less preposterous, following reports that Bayern Munich are ready to offer the 70-year-old their vacant manager’s job until the end of the season.With Niko Kovac having been unceremoniously ushered through the door marked “Ausfahrt”, the Sun says the German champions have made an approach to Wenger, although The Athletic’s Raphael Honigstein claims the former Arsenal manager is not on the club’s shortlist of potential replacements.

It is only necessary to glance at the league table now or last season to see why games between Liverpool and Manchester City are important in terms of the title race. The managers have had a nibble at each other over ing and tactical fouling in the buildup and few attending Anfield on Sunday will doubt that one side or the other will end up champions, yet for a variety of reasons there seems a reluctance to accept this fixture as the biggest in English football.Perhaps the most obvious one is that it is not yet the biggest rivalry in English football. When it was suggested to Jürgen Klopp last season that the City game might soon assume the significance of Liverpool’s ancient battle for supremacy with Manchester United, with all its perch-clearing braggadocio and title hauls running into double figures, even a German knew England well enough to dismiss the notion as “bollocks”.It is not that Klopp feels the United rivalry particularly keenly – during his time in England he has never had to encounter a sustained threat from the direction of Old Trafford – it is more that like everyone else he doubts whether City and Liverpool have been going at it long enough to claim a place at the forefront of this country’s footballing culture.Liverpool have not won a league title for 30 years, and in those circumstances Klopp is understandably wary of claiming his side are at the forefront of anything. City have been the team to beat for two impeccable campaigns now – last season they added a clean sweep of domestic trophies to their impressive 100-point total in 2017‑18 – yet before the overseas money arrived they were even longer in the wilderness between titles, not to mention dropping as low as the third tier of English football.So while this particular two-team hegemony is a new twist at the top of the Premier League, no one quite knows how long it will last and a certain amount of ill-feeling building up over time is what is required to produce memorable set pieces such as Arsenal’s Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford or Rafa Benítez’s infamous list of facts.Klopp and Pep Guardiola seem to quite like each other. On the evidence of previous meetings mutual admiration is more likely than mischief or mind games and to an extent the same is true of both sets of supporters. There is not much history of grudge or animosity between Liverpool and City fans, even if the former did give the visitors’ coach a rough ride when the teams met in the Champions League at Anfield two seasons ago. All too plainly their common dislike of Manchester United is greater than any rancorous mistrust of each other.What might it take then, to turn the absorbing battle between the best two sides in the country into a fully fledged rivalry, something to be savoured in the present and remembered down the years? It would undoubtedly help for a start were Guardiola and Klopp to stick around for several more seasons.At the moment they are not perceived as permanent fixtures at their clubs Guardiola especially is expected to continue moving around rather than putting in many more years at the Etihad Stadium and the idea that City and Liverpool have achieved their present levels of excellence by bringing in the best European managers available on a short-term basis is contributing to the feeling that this phase of English football might be a relatively transitory one.Short-term is itself a relative construct – both managers have been at their clubs for three or four years already and could easily stay much longer – but it would be a considerable surprise were either to last half as long as Sir Alex Ferguson or Arsène Wenger. Nothing wrong with that, probably no one is going to manage that sort of longevity in the Premier League again, though as Klopp and Guardiola are undoubtedly wringing the utmost from their respective sets of players it follows they might be hard to replace without a drop in performance.Without attempting too look too far into the future, it is not easy to see how City or Liverpool will be able to carry on seamlessly under different managers and the suspicion that succession problems lie ahead adds to the impression that these two sides may never have it quite so good again.Before all that is worked out, however, another intriguing possibility could take shape. Supposing City were to win the Champions League this season, and Liverpool end their wait for a league title? This was a plausible scenario for much of last season and remains so this time.Given City’s frustrations in Europe over the years and Liverpool’s overwhelming desire to see their title total ticking over again, both clubs would be highly satisfied with such an outcome. It is not a binary situation: either City or Liverpool could win both prizes, or end up with one between them or nothing at all, though there would be a pleasing symmetry should last season’s roles be reversed.This mirror-image conclusion would not be a first for English football or even for Liverpool. Bob Paisley’s side won the European Cup in 1978 and the first ision title a year later, while Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest were European champions in 1979 a season after picking up their first and only English title.While that was not the most long-lasting of rivalries either, it was feisty at the time and the names will never be forgotten. If City and Liverpool can stage some sort of repeat, in the intensified era of the Premier League and the Champions League, it is probably safe to say that history will take due note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4c166d54f0226ac33aac26dcc21a9cea4faeb53/0_275_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=113328d6160372dd9c42e13c6da351ee","title":"faking it could i go from being an introvert to an extrovert in one week ","story":"New research has found that being an extrovert makes you happier. So I spent a week attending social events to see if I could trick myself into being more naturally outgoingI was asked to torture myself for a week for this experiment. Well, not torture, but close enough for me. For a week, this introvert would put social awkwardness to one side and live as an extrovert. I don’t particularly enjoy meeting new people. I decline most party invitations and if I do go, I leave as soon as I can without causing offence. Sometimes I fantasise about doing what Princess Diana used to do when she wanted to lose friends – change her phone number. So the prospect of spending a week saying yes to every social engagement that came my way was about as appealing as a root canal treatment.But evidence shows that conquering your inner introversion can be good for your mental health. In the first study of its kind, researchers at the University of California asked 123 people to act as extroverts for a week. Participants were asked to be talkative, assertive and spontaneous in their daily interactions with other people. The following week, the same group was asked to act like introverts. The findings were remarkable.“It was the biggest effect we’ve ever found in any of our studies,” says Dr Sonja Lyubomirsky, the lead researcher. “When people acted extrovert, they experienced more positive emotions and satisfaction. When they acted introvert, they experienced fewer positive emotions.” She speculates that this is because, at heart, humans are social creatures. “Social relationships are inherently rewarding for us. We have a need to belong and to connect with each other.”She advises me to steer clear of small talk, which is good, because I loathe it. “If you spend the whole week talking about the weather, I think you’ll hate it.” Instead, go deep and be vulnerable. “Share something vulnerable about yourself, even if that seems terrifying. A person will match that normally and you will feel as if you’re making a friend.”Pan gives me a set of rules: no booze because it makes things easier, no taking a friend along for moral support – “That’s cheating!” – and I must spend an hour and a half at each engagement, minimum. Here goes nothing.I start the week by attending an Extinction Rebellion induction meeting. I have toyed with the idea of joining the movement for months, but put it off because none of my friends are members and the thought of going alone frightens me.In a chilly church hall, I take a seat in a circle of stacking chairs. There is a long pause while I steel myself to turn to the person next to me.“Hi,” I say. “I’m Sirin.”I start chatting to Ben, who has just moved into the area. He is a friendly bloke with a deep tan and a placid manner. Remembering Pan’s advice, I offer something vulnerable about myself. “I’ve wanted to come to these meetings for ages, but none of my friends wanted to come with me.” My anxieties tumble out. “Also I eat meat and fly, and I’m worried everyone here would judge me.”Ben looks at me kindly. After the meeting, he waves at me from the church steps. I’ll be back, I think.This evening I am playing dodgeball with strangers and all I can think about is how much I don’t want to do it. I was abysmal at team sports at school, and the thought of balls ricocheting around me feels like an anxiety dream. After checking the maximum velocity of a dodgeball (70mph), I panic and call Jacob, the Headshot United team coordinator, for some last-minute reassurance.“We’re really bad,” Jacob promises. “We’ve lost the last nine games. Besides, you can hide at the back. There will be a few people who wear knee pads and stuff like that – try not to worry about them.”I catch up with Jacob and his teammate, Ed, for a pre-game drink. “Someone joined us last week and said they didn’t have a good time and wouldn’t be coming back,” says Ed. I gulp.Jacob senses my anxiety. “If you really are hating it, you don’t have to keep playing,” he says.We head to a nearby school gym. Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. “You took that head shot like an absolute champ,” observes a teammate.While I didn’t enjoy dodgeball – hated it, if I’m honest – I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. “You’re not the worst newcomer we’ve ever had,” Jacob says.Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don’t know. We’re going to a Crossfit class – a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur.Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. “I’M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,” Rich bellows at me. “COME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!” We hug. “He’s like that with everyone,” Emma says. “He’s just really happy.”I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. “You’re doing great!” she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. “Good pace!”After the class, JP instructs us – orders, really – to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I’m just happy I didn’t get hit in the face.“What is a weed?” asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest’s volunteer gardening group, “It’s a plant in the wrong place.”The group meets every Thursday morning to tend the grounds behind the William Morris Gallery in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before – not my favourite thing.My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. “It’s difficult, making friends in London,” she says. “It’s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They’d think you were a nutter.”After a tea break, I’m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. “I just fling the worms away,” says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. “You’ll come back, won’t you?” says Judith.I’m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger.On Bumble BFF, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It’s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it’s not the sort of place where you can chat and it’s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week – it was the Diwali celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn’t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard.A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I’m relieved.I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won’t go away . Why? I’m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don’t know, and I’ll be flying solo.As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don’t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can’t put off going any longer.Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. “ARGH I DON’T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.” She texts back. “Talk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.”I take a breath and ring the bell.Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula – takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan’s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird.It’s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags – but I’m so tired after the week’s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. “Your costume was awful,” Dan says, walking me to the door.I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today’s walk, which is organised by the London Strollers. It’s no bother – one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people.About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offensive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don’t think I can bear this.Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin – my knight in a green raincoat.We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours – preferably a communist. “Socialists, they sit on the fence,” Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill.I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together.So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us inidual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It’s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell.I’m still an introvert and I don’t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe.

Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van. They do spicy pizzas for grownups too. The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs. Once I saw a beautiful brown horse.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel with Thameslink on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets (T\u0026ampCs apply).

Say hello to Worthing: the lesser-known beachside beauty with bucket-and-spades-full of family fun. Lola Davies, aged 13 (with a little help from mum Tracey), gives us the inside scoop on family time in her favourite seaside spot by Lola and Tracey DaviesI’m going to call this guide “The Importance of Being Worthing”, because my English teacher says that Oscar Wilde spent a summer here in 1894 – and wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in Worthing.Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing’s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more – and it was happening more frequently.“I saw a Catholic priest,” said the man. “But he couldn’t help. Can you?”Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do.I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney’s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and ine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes.As a teenager, I’d devoured a book called Positive Magic. An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties.That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break. She picked the card for pregnancy, which we laughed about, because she wanted her tubes tied.A week later she said, “Guess what the doctor told me this morning?”She was pregnant, and I was officially psychic.Deciding to develop my gift, I enrolled in a psychic class, where I learned to say the first thing that popped into my head. “Your first thoughts are the most psychic ones, before your rational mind interferes,” said the teacher.I also learned that all things are connected, and everything is a symbol of something else. Suddenly, I saw signs and omens everywhere.To test my new skills, I volunteered to be a clairvoyant at the spiritualist church. Congregants would place a flower on the table, and the clairvoyants would choose one and “read” it at the microphone. Nervous, the first thing I grabbed was a packet of silver foil. The rose inside had been packed so tightly, its petals were crushed. I didn’t get a single vibe from it, so I just described the symbolism.“You are feeling battered and bruised,” I said.Afterwards, a woman approached and said she was a victim of domestic violence, and what should she do?I was only 19 and had no idea, but my psychic reputation soared. The attention was intoxicating.Then the universe told me I wasn’t cut out for science, by sending me my second-year results. I dropped out to pursue theatre and also signed up for a one-year course at the Sydney Astrology Centre, a cavernous commercial building in a seedy part of town.The course began with the meanings of the zodiac, from Aries to Aquarius. Then the luminaries the sun (what you will become), the moon (what you brought into this life) and planets. After that, how to calculate planetary positions and cast horoscopes.Although astrologers use Nasa data for their calculations, horoscopes aren’t a true map of the heavens. The Babylonians who invented astrology believed the sun rotated round the Earth modern astrologers still use Earth-centred charts, as if Copernicus had never existed. That’s only the start of the scientific problems.The astrological meanings themselves derive from a principle called sympathetic magic, where things that look alike are linked together. Mars looks red, so it rules red things like blood. How do you get blood? You cut, so Mars rules surgery and war.You forecast by combining meanings with planetary movements. Say Saturn, planet of restrictions, is about to transit the First House of self – your life will contract! You’re going to get more responsibilities than usual. Or maybe you’ll be denied the chance to take on more responsibilities. Or maybe a cold, critical person will come into your life. But anyway, it’s a good time to go on a diet.Astrology is one big word association game.I loved it, though I was losing interest in other mystical practices. Partly I didn’t have time, because I was now immersed in theatre while working as a temp typist at St Vincent’s, a Catholic hospital. But as I bounced from one department to another, my views changed. I’d understood organised religion to be something between an embarrassment and an evil. Yet as Aids did its dreadful work – this was the 1990s – I watched nuns offer compassionate care to the dying. Christian volunteers checked on derelict men with vomit down their clothes. I became uncomfortably aware that New Agers do not build hospitals or feed alcoholics – they buy self-actualisation at the cash register.Finally, I was accepted into a music degree and my days filled with classes, my nights with rehearsals. This caused a cash crisis, because I could only do office work during academic holidays. When I saw the ad for a fortune teller, I pounced.My credentials impressed the man on the counter (“My name is Ron,” he said. “My spirit guide is Blue Star. He’s on the intergalactic committee”) and I was hired.We charged A$50 an hour, a significant sum at the time, and I wanted to offer value. No fishing for clues from me – I printed a horoscope or laid the cards and started interpreting immediately, intending to dazzle the customer with my insights.Half the time, though, I couldn’t get a word in. It turned out what most people want is the chance to unload for an hour. The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change. I heard these stories so often I could often guess what the problem was the moment someone walked in. Heartbroken young men, for example, talk about it to psychics, because it’s less risky than telling their friends. Sometimes I’d mischievously say, “Let her go. She’s not worth it,” as soon as one arrived. Once I heard, “Oh my God, oh my GOD!” as an amazed guy fell backwards down the stairs.I also learned that intelligence and education do not protect against superstition. Many customers were stockbrokers, advertising executives or politicians, dealing with issues whose outcomes couldn’t be controlled. It’s uncertainty that drives people into woo, not stupidity, so I’m not surprised millennials are into astrology. They grew up with Harry Potter and graduated into a precarious economy, making them the ideal customers.What broke the spell for me was, oddly, people swearing by my gift. Some repeat customers claimed I’d made very specific predictions, of a kind I never made. It dawned on me that my readings were a co-creation – I would weave a story and, later, the customer’s memory would add new elements. I got to test this theory after a friend raved about a reading she’d had, full of astonishingly accurate predictions. She had a tape of the session, so I asked her to play it.The clairvoyant had said none of the things my friend claimed. Not a single one. My friend’s imagination had done all the work.Yet sometimes I could be uncannily accurate – wasn’t that proof I was psychic? One Sunday, I went straight from work to a party, before I’d had time to shuck off my psychic persona. A student there mentioned she wasn’t sure what to specialize in – photography, graphic design or maybe industrial design?“Do photography,” I said.She looked at me, wide-eyed. “How did you know?” she said, explaining photography was her real love, but her parents didn’t approve.I couldn’t say, “because my third eye is open”, so I reflected for a moment. Then it hit me. “You sounded happier when you said ‘photography’,” I said. My psychic teacher was right – the signals we pick up before conscious awareness kicks in can be accurate and valuable.Well, maybe I wasn’t psychic, but it didn’t matter. It was just entertainment, after all, until the cursed man came in. The one who’d seen the Catholic priest.“Get to a doctor,” I told him. “Now.”That very week, I’d typed letters for a neurologist who specialized in brain diseases. Some of those letters had documented strikingly similar symptoms to this man.“Are you saying I’m crazy?” he said, his hands balled.“No,” I reassured him. “But Catholic priests know what they’re doing. If he couldn’t help, this isn’t a curse.”That made the man angrier.“You’re a fraud!” he shouted, and stormed downstairs to demand his money back.The encounter shook me, badly. Shortly afterwards, I packed my astrology books and Tarot cards away for good.I can still make the odd forecast, though. Here’s one: the venture capital pouring into astrology apps will create a fortune telling system that works, because humans are predictable. As people follow the advice, the apps’ predictive powers will increase, creating an ever-tighter electronic leash. But they’ll be hugely popular – because if you sprinkle magic on top, you can sell people anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af628bf8287019b88d9c70c845ccf8084b89e195/437_572_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6ca4025652783009e5908c8516ae08","title":"have you seen any uk political adverts without disclosures on social media general election","story":"During the general election campaign we would like to hear about the political adverts you have seen on social media From 22 November political adverts will be banned on Twitter, however, other social media platforms such as Facebook will still allow them on their sites.Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them.Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts.However, commercial adverts do not say who they are “paid for by” but only show that they are sponsored.If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you.If you see an advert that does not say “paid for by” screenshot it.

Punters chug cans of pink cocktails outside the venue the merch booth sells thongs emblazoned with “JUICE” in tribute to Lizzo’s brilliant synthpop track and dozens of fans wear bridal veils in a nod to Truth Hurts’ wedding-themed video. The stage backdrop is painted to resemble a cathedral’s stained glass and there’s a DJ in a pulpit on which Lizzo, wearing a corseted gold leotard, occasionally twerks to deafening screams. As if daring heavenly powers to smite the venue with a lightning bolt, she promptly launches into the brassy funk of her cunnilingus manifesto Worship, on which she commands: “Worship me  On your knees.”In an efficient 80-minute show, Lizzo’s pace and exuberance barely let up, allowing her to breeze through similar-sounding songs from her patchy album Cuz I Love You without the pace dragging (although a cover of Respect has a whiff of X Factor). She’s flanked by four charismatic dancers, whose high-cut leotards enable Lizzo to affectionately squeeze their bare bums. On Good As Hell, an empowerment anthem as happily naff as a Netflix romcom, Lizzo embraces her squad and pogos on the balls of her feet, before giving them the floor during the trap-leaning Tempo for a braid-flipping dance-off, girl power style. After leading the crowd in a chant of “I am my inspiration” – a lyric from her 80s-inspired 2017 track Water Me, she hops onto a stool with a promise to spill “the tea”. “Fuckboys don’t love themselves,” she informs the rapt crowd. “Let the love you have for yourself shine brighter than any scrub.” Later, she mimes drop kicking a bad boyfriend: “We don’t got time for that in 2020, bitch!”Lizzo’s unadorned powerhouse vocals could recall gospel greats, but her live singing style has one red-lining volume level, which strips a song like her tortured break-up chronicle Jerome of the album version’s nuance. In a poignant moment towards the end of the show, she talks of battling depressive episodes. “I get lost sometimes,” she says pensively. “And I’m the bitch that wrote an album about loving yourself!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef950f2ccc2532c96e600cbec15d65a861a6229/0_0_3455_2074/master/3455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d60ac67660fd6979331f01a423249754","title":"keith flint prodigy possessions go to auction in pictures","story":"Personal items from the home of the Prodigy’s late frontman are to be sold on Thursday.

Or did it? By  Emmanuel CarrèreToward the end of the 1960s, Luke Rhinehart worked as a psychoanalyst in New York and was bored stiff. He lived in a pretty apartment with a nice view. He practised yoga, read books on Zen, dreamed vaguely of joining a commune but did not dare. As a therapist, he was resolutely nondirective. If a patient who still had not lost his virginity was plagued by sadistic impulses and said on Rhinehart’s couch that he would like to rape and kill a little girl, his professional ethics obliged him to repeat with a calm voice: “You’d like to rape and kill a little girl?” No judgment. But what he wanted to say was: “Well, go ahead, then! If what really turns you on is raping and killing a little girl, then stop boring me with this fantasy. Do it!”He checked himself before coming out with such monstrosities, but they obsessed him more and more. His own fantasies were nothing extreme – not enough to get him sent to prison – but like everyone else, he stopped himself going through with them. What Luke would have liked, for example, was to sleep with Arlene, the wife of his colleague Jake Ecstein, who lived across the landing. But as a faithful husband, he let the idea simmer away in the back of his mind.So life plods on, calm and dreary, until one night after a dinner party, when he has had a little too much to drink. Rhinehart sees a dice lying on the carpet, a banal playing dice, and gets the idea of throwing it and acting on its instructions. He says to himself: “If it lands on a number from two to six, I’ll do what I would have done anyway: bring the dirty glasses back to the kitchen, brush my teeth, take a double aspirin, go to bed beside my sleeping wife, and maybe masturbate discreetly thinking of Arlene. But if I roll a one, I’ll do what I really want to do: I know Arlene’s at home alone tonight, so I’ll go across the hall, knock on her door and sleep with her.”The dice lands on one. Rhinehart hesitates, feeling vaguely that he is standing on a threshold: if he crosses it, his life could change. But it is not his decision, it is the dice’s, so he obeys. Arlene opens the door in a negligee she is surprised but not put out. When Rhinehart comes back home two extremely pleasant hours later, he realises that he has changed. He did something he wouldn’t normally do.From now on, he always consults the dice. Since it has six sides, he gives it six options. The first is to do what he has always done. The five others depart more or less distinctly from this routine. Once it has been subjected to the dice, even the most anodyne choice – that of a film, a restaurant – opens a vast array of possibilities for putting your routine behind you.His choices soon become more audacious. Going somewhere he would never go, getting to know people he would otherwise never meet. He pushes his patients to leave their families and jobs, to change their political and sexual orientations. His reputation suffers, but Rhinehart does not care. What he likes, now, is doing the exact opposite of what he would normally do: putting salt in his coffee, jogging in a tuxedo, going to work in shorts, pissing in the flowerpots, walking backward, sleeping under his bed. His wife finds him strange, but he says it is a psychological experiment, and she lets herself be lulled into believing it. Until the day he gets the idea of initiating his children.One weekend when their mother is not there, Rhinehart gets his little boy and girl to play this apparently innocent game: you write six things you would like to do on a piece of paper, and the dice chooses one of them. It all goes well at the start: they eat ice cream, go to the zoo. Then his son becomes bolder and says that one thing he would like to do is go beat up a boy who bugs him at school. “OK, write it down,” Rhinehart says, and that is what the dice rolls. The boy thinks his father won’t make him go through with it, but his dad says: “Go ahead.” The boy goes to his friend’s place, hits him several times, and comes back to the house with his eyes shining and asks: “Where are the dice, Dad?”That makes Rhinehart stop and think: if his son so naturally adopts this way of being, it is because he is not yet completely warped by the absurd notion that it is good for children to develop a coherent character. What if they were brought up differently, giving pride of place to contradiction, multiplicity and relentless change? Luke seriously thinks of freeing his son from the dismal tyranny of the ego and making him the first man entirely subject to chance. Then his wife returns and discovers what has been going on. Not finding it funny in the least, she leaves Rhinehart and takes the children with her.Next, it is his profession that Rhinehart abandons, after disgracing himself (on the dice’s instructions) at an evening with the cream of New York psychoanalysts. With no family, work or personal ties, he is free to move from transgression to transgression. Eventually, the day comes when the dice pushes him to do things that he had not only never dared to do, but didn’t want to do, because they ran counter to his tastes, his desires, his whole personality. But that’s just it: the personality – the miserable, petty personality – is the enemy to be done away with, the conditioning that you have to free yourself from.Sooner or later, he could not avoid writing “murder” on his list of options. When the dice orders him to do it, Rhinehart is forced to draw up a list of six potential victims, in which he courageously includes his two children. Luckily for him, he is spared that particular ordeal: the dice simply demands that he kill one of his former patients.If you believe his autobiography, he went through with it, although certain commentators doubt it. What does seem certain is that having ruined his career, his family life and his reputation, Rhinehart was ready to become a prophet, and that is what he did. In these years when the most paradoxical therapies flourished from one side of the US to the other, a guru with a dice had every chance of attracting followers. So he establishes the Centers for Experiments in Totally Random Environments, where you enrol of your own free will but undertake not to leave until the experiment is over. In time, students are expected to commit to roleplays of varying durations: you list six personality types and for 10 minutes, an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year, adopt the one that the dice decides.Some of the followers of dice therapy went insane. Others died or ended up in prison. Some, it seems, reached a state of nirvana. During their short existence, Rhinehart’s centres became as scandalous as Timothy Leary’s communities: a school of chaos posing as serious a threat to civilisation as communism or the satanism of Charles Manson, as the conservative newspapers had it. The end of the adventure is shrouded in obscurity. It is said that Rhinehart was arrested by the FBI, that he spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital. Or that he died. Or that he never existed at all.Everything I have just told comes from a book, The Dice Man, published in the US in 1971 and translated into French the following year. I was 16 when I discovered it, as a terribly timid adolescent with long hair, an afghan jacket and little round glasses. For a while, I walked around with a dice in my pocket, counting on it to give me the self-confidence I lacked with girls. (Not that it worked too well.) The Dice Man is the kind of book that not only pleases readers but also gives them a set of rules for life: a manual for subversion.It was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography, but its author, Luke Rhinehart, had the same name as his hero and, like him, he was a psychiatrist. According to the back cover, he lived in Majorca – seemingly the ideal refuge for a prophet at the end of his tether, who has just managed to escape from his shipwrecked community of maniacs. The years passed, The Dice Man remained the object of a minor but persistent cult, and each time I met someone who had read it (almost always a pothead, and often a follower of the I Ching), the same questions came up: what was true in the book? Who was Luke Rhinehart? What had become of him?After The Dice Man came up in conversation a little while back, I started to wonder once again what had become of Luke Rhinehart. In an hour online, of course, I learned more about Rhinehart than I had in 30 years of idle conjecture.His real name is George Cockcroft, and though no longer young, he is alive. He has written other books, but none as successful as The Dice Man, which almost 50 years after it came out is still a cult classic. Dozens of sites are dedicated to it, and just as many legends circulate about it. Ten times it was almost adapted for the cinema, but mysteriously the project never came about. Communities of followers of the dice still exist all over the world. As for the mythical author, he lives as a recluse on a remote farm in upstate New York. One particular photo of him makes the rounds: it shows a sarcastic, gaunt face under a stetson. I imagine Luke Rhinehart as something like Carlos Castaneda, William Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon rolled into one: an icon of the most radical subversion, transformed into an invisible man. I decide that I must meet him.One detail should have warned me that my initial ideas were not quite right: my invisible man has his own website, through which I was able to contact him. He answered my message in less than an hour, with surprising good grace for a recluse. I wanted to come from France to interview him? What a good idea! When I filled him in on the reason for my visit, he told me that he hoped he was not going to disappoint me: on my search for Luke Rhinehart I was going to meet George Cockcroft, and George Cockcroft, in his own words, was an old fart. I took this warning as false modesty.For the past couple of weeks, I have been in contact with some followers of the dice on the internet, and on my way through New York I invite one to dinner. Ron is 30, introduces himself as a conceptual artist and urban pirate, and heads a community of dice people who meet every month for what, under all the new-age jargon, seems to be good old group sex, where the dice above all decides who will be on top, who on the bottom and so on. No such thing is planned for the days when I will be there, I learn a little to my regret, but the urban pirate appears impressed by my boldness: knocking on Luke Rhinehart’s door! Pulling on the tiger’s whiskers! That’s really venturing into the dark side of the Force. I answer that to judge by the author’s messages, he seems like a nice old guy.Ron looks at me pensively, with a touch of pity: “A nice old guy … Sure, why not? Maybe the dice ordered him to play that role for you. But don’t forget that a dice has six sides. He’s showing you one, you don’t know what’s behind the other five, or when he’ll decide to reveal them … ”The man waiting for me when I arrive in Hudson in upstate New York is wearing the same Stetson as he is in that photograph. He has the same jagged features, the same faded blue eyes and the same slightly sardonic smile. He is tall and has a bit of a slouch you could even find him sinister, but when I hold out my hand, he gives me a big hug, kisses me on both cheeks as if I were his son and introduces me to his wife, Ann, who is just as warm and welcoming as he is.We all pile into their old station wagon, and as we drive past the orchards and through the woods, I realise that this landscape reminds me of one of my favourite novels: Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. My hosts are enchanted: it is one of their favourites as well, and George has often taught it to his students.To his students? He is not a psychiatrist, or a psychoanalyst?“Psychiatrist? Psychoanalyst?” George repeats, as surprised as if I had said cosmonaut. No, he was never a psychiatrist, he has been a college English teacher all his life.Really? But on the cover of his book …George shrugs as if to say, editors, journalists, you know, there is almost nothing they won’t write.From Hudson we drive for about an hour he handles the wheel with an abruptness that contrasts with his good humour and makes his wife laugh. It is moving to see how the two love each other, and when Ann tells me in passing that they have been married for 50 years, I am not surprised.They live in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond. They have three grown boys, two of whom live nearby. One is a carpenter and the other is a housepainter the third still lives at home. He is schizophrenic, Ann tells me matter-of-factly he is doing fine at the moment, but I shouldn’t worry if I hear him speaking a bit loudly in his room, which is right beside the guest room where I will be staying. (I invited myself for the weekend, but I get the feeling that if I wanted to settle in for a week or a month, it wouldn’t be a problem.)Ann serves us tea, and George and I take our mugs out on to the terrace for the interview. He has swapped his Stetson for a baseball cap, and I ask him to tell me about his life. He starts from the beginning.He was born in 1932 in Albany, just a few miles from where he now lives and where, in all likelihood, he will die. Semi-rural middle-class, hit hard by the Depression, in spite of which he looks back on a more or less happy childhood and youth. Good at maths, a bit of an egghead and not adventurous in the least, he reached 20 without having felt the slightest creative urge. At college he began studying psychology, but found it tedious and instead decided it was better to read novels.While working night shifts as an intern in a hospital on Long Island, he devoured Mark Twain, Herman Melville and the great 19th-century Russian writers. He started working on a novel that took place in a psychiatric hospital. The hero is a young man who has been interned because he thinks he is Jesus, and among the hospital staff is a doctor named Luke Rhinehart, who practises dice therapy. The dice was a quirk the young George picked up in college. He and his friends used it on Saturdays to decide what they were going to do that night. Sometimes, they dared each other to do stuff: hop around the block on one leg, ring a neighbour’s doorbell, nothing too mischievous. When I ask, hopefully, whether he pushed these experiences further as an adult, he shrugs his shoulders and smiles apologetically because he can tell that I would like something a little spicier.“No,” he admits. “All I asked the dice was, for example, if I’d had enough of working: do I stay at my desk for another hour? Or two hours? Or do I go for a walk right away?”“What are you talking about?” says Ann, who has come on to the terrace to offer us some blueberry crumble. “Don’t you remember at least one important decision that the dice made you take?”He laughs, so does she, and he tells me that he had noticed an attractive nurse at the hospital, but was shy and didn’t dare talk to her. The dice made him do it: he drove her home, took her to church, but the church was closed, so he invited her to play tennis. Of course, the attractive nurse was Ann.Ten years later they had three little boys, and George, who had become an English teacher, applied for a job at the American school in Mallorca. This expatriation is the big adventure of their lives. Although Mallorca in the 1960s was associated with psychedelia and wild living, George didn’t take drugs, was faithful to his wife, and mostly just hung around with other teachers like himself. Still, he didn’t completely escape the zeitgeist. He started to read books on psychoanalysis, antipsychiatry, oriental mysticism, Zen – all aspects of 1960s counterculture, whose grand idea was that we are conditioned, and that we must free ourselves from this conditioning. Influenced by this reading, he suddenly became aware of the revolutionary potential of something he had thought of as no more than a simple game, and had more or less given up since his adolescence. Although he had also long ago given up on the idea of writing books, he got fired up about what would become The Dice Man. He spent four years writing it, supported faithfully by his wife.Much to their surprise, an editor paid good money for the book, and the rights were sold to Paramount. Then The Dice Man started to live its erratic, unpredictable life: success in Europe but not in the US, regular new editions and, eventually, cult status. There were disappointments: for one obscure reason or another the film was never made, and none of his other books had the same success. But the rights from The Dice Man allowed them to buy this beautiful house, and to age with dignity – George writing, Ann painting, both of them caring for their son with schizophrenia.The day I visited was Mother’s Day, and the two other boys came over to celebrate it with their parents. They are good American kids: Budweiser drinkers, trout fishers, wearers of checkered shirts. Later, their brother came out of his room for a short while. All three told Ann she was “a terrific mom”. After dinner, we finished the evening at the house of one of their sons, also in the middle of the countryside. He has an outdoor jacuzzi, in which George and I continued to drink while looking up at the stars, with the result that I don’t quite remember how I made it back to my room.It is strange how much you can project on to a photograph. The one of Luke Rhinehart made me imagine a whole novel: a dangerous, sulphurous life filled with excesses, transgressions and ruptures. Bordellos in Mexico, communities of madmen in the Nevada desert, delirious, mind-expanding experiences. And this face, the same face with strong bones and eyes of steel, is in fact that of an adorable old man who is approaching the end of a sweet, comfortable life with his adorable wife, a man whose only departure from the norm was to have written this alarming book, and who in his old age must softly, gently explain to people who come to see him that you must not confuse it with him, and that he is simply a novelist.Really? But what did I know about the reality? I remembered the warning of Ron, the urban pirate. What you see, the adorable old man, is just one side of the dice. It is the side that the dice ordered him to show you, but at least five others are in reserve.At breakfast I could see that George was worried he had disappointed me. So he took me kayaking on a lake, and as our kayaks skimmed slowly over the calm water, he told me the stories of some of his disciples. What he was content merely to imagine, others did for real. Take the tycoon Richard Branson. He used to say that all of his choices in business and in life had been taken thanks to the dice, influenced by Luke Rhinehart.Then there was the British gonzo journalist Ben Marshall who, in the 1990s, took on an assignment in which he would follow Rhinehart’s example for three months: let all of your decisions be taken by the dice and write about what happens. The journalist took the assignment seriously enough, it seems, to trash his love life and his professional life, and to disappear without a trace for several months. “A funny guy, that Ben,” George tells me. “You can see him in Diceworld, a documentary made by an English TV channel in 1999.”I had never heard of this documentary and ask if George has a copy we can watch. All of a sudden he looks embarrassed. He says it is not great, and he is not sure he even has it. But I insist, and in no time we are sitting on the living room couch in front of the big TV and the film starts. It is true, it is not great. But it does show Marshall, who volunteered to gamble his life on the dice and who explains convincingly how he stopped before he went mad, because the dice can drive you mad.And lo and behold, whom do we see next? His inspiration, our friend George – or rather, our friend Luke, as he was 15 years ago: the Stetson, the gaunt face, the steely eyes, handsome, but not at all like the doting grandfather I know. In a low, insinuating, hypnotic voice, he says into the camera: “You lead a dull life, a life of slavery, a life that doesn’t satisfy you, but there’s a way to get out of it. This way is the dice. Let yourself go, submit yourself to it, and you’ll see, your life will change, you’ll become someone you can’t even imagine.”Saying this, he looks like a televangelist, the head of a sect filmed just before his followers commit mass suicide. He is frightening. I turn to look at the person beside me on the couch, the nice pensioner in slippers holding his mug of herbal tea. He gives me an embarrassed, apologetic smile and says that the Luke in this film is not him. He, George, wasn’t so keen on it, but the director insisted.Ann, who can hear us from the kitchen, laughs gaily. “You’re watching the film where you play the spook?”He laughs, too, beside me on the couch. Nevertheless, when I see him on the screen, I find him awfully convincing.I met other followers of the dice over the internet: one in Salt Lake City, one in Munich, one in Madrid. All men. In Madrid, Oscar Cuadrado, who came to meet me at the airport, is young, a bit pudgy, and nice. On the way to his place in his 4×4, he made what was by now a familiar joke: “I may look nice, but you never know what the dice’s got in store for tonight: maybe I’m a serial killer and you’ll find yourself chained to my basement wall.”He lives in a stylish house in the suburbs, together with his wife and daughter, and without further ado we sat at a lawn table and consulted the dice: do we have a drink right away, or do we wait until we have done the interview? Three sides for a drink, three against: we could just as well have tossed a coin. The answer: right away. Now, do we drink beer, table wine or the bottle that Cuadrado’s saving for his daughter’s 18th birthday? Two sides for the beer, three for the table wine, and just one for the special bottle, because although he would open it willingly – you don’t refuse the dice – still … Finally, it is over a glass of table wine that he explains to me how he uses the dice.Like everyone, Cuadrado has heard of people who have ruined their lives by setting extreme conditions such as going halfway around the world and never coming back, having sex with animals or stabbing someone at random in a crowded train station in India. Stories like that circulate on all sites dedicated to the dice – including the one he has been managing for the past 10 years – but they don’t interest him. He recommends using it in a way that makes life more fun and surprising.He has three rules. The first is to always obey. But obeying the dice is ultimately obeying yourself, since you set your options. Hence the second rule, concerning the decisive moment when you list the six possibilities. You have to examine yourself and try to find out what you want. It is a spiritual exercise, aimed both at getting to know yourself and getting a better grasp of the infinite possibilities that reality offers. The options you select have to be pleasant, but at least one – the third – has to be something you would not normally do. It has to make you overcome resistance and break with habit. When you throw the dice, your desire has to be tinged with fear.Ever since he discovered the Spanish translation of The Dice Man when he was 17, this sort of small challenge has been second nature to Cuadrado. Like his father, he is a tax lawyer, but thanks to the dice he has also become a wine importer, a webmaster, a Go teacher, a fan of Iceland and the publisher of the Mauritian poet Malcolm de Chazal. How’s that? Well, first he thought it would be good to get to know a foreign country. Six continents, six options. The dice fell on Europe, then, narrowing the choices, on Iceland. Fine. Now, how should he visit it: on foot, by car, hitchhiking, by boat, by bike or on a skateboard? It landed on bike. The only problem: he had never ridden one before. So he learned, toured Iceland by bike, and even went back with the young woman who would become his wife. On this trip the dice got him to make the proposal, which was accepted.For their honeymoon, the young couple travelled to Mauritius – a present from his parents-in-law, not the dice. But once there, Cuadrado made up for it. He looked around for something to read, an author with something to do with Mauritius. The dice chose the poet Malcolm de Chazal. Bingo: he fell completely in love with De Chazal, a creole surrealist whom the artist André Breton was crazy about. Seeing that De Chazal had not been translated into Spanish, when Cuadrado got back from his honeymoon he founded a publishing company to change that. He knew nothing about publishing, no more than he had known about bike riding. But when he pulls the books from his shelf, I can understand why he is proud: they are magnificent. He sums up: “It’s through Luke that I discovered Malcolm, and now it’s thanks to him that I’ve met you. Funny, isn’t it?”It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead.Luke didn’t fear death, although he confessed to being a bit nervous. Death to him was just another one of life’s unknowns, like travelling to a new land, starting a new book, trusting a new friend. Luke liked to laugh at death, but then again he liked to laugh at everything. He felt confident that death wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. He promised to report back as soon as he could and let us know what he had found. He was confident we would all get a good chuckle out of it. However, at this point we still haven’t heard word.Some of you have asked about Luke’s last days. They were no different from days from any week over the last several decades. People who came to see him on the basis of his books were sometimes discouraged to discover how attached he was to his habits. Even when he threw the dice, it was always to do more or less the same things.“It’s not rolling along in the same old patterns that is bad in itself,” he said, “but rather if you’re enjoying the rolling. If you’re comfortable in the selves you’re rolling along with, then roll on. Most people aren’t. They don’t like who they are. It’s with them in mind that I wrote all those things about the dice. But I’m fine as I am.”Luke’s wife, Ann, was with him to the end.When I received this email, I was surprised, then sad, then moved. Since I had their number, I called Ann to express my condolences. When she picked up the phone, she was as cordial as ever, but she sounded a bit hurried and said she would pass me on to George. I stuttered something about the email I had just received, and she answered like someone who was used to this sort of little misunderstanding: “Oh, the email! Of course … But don’t worry: it’s not George who died, it’s Luke.”When he got on the line, George confirmed: “Yeah, I was getting a little tired of Luke. I’m getting older, you know. I still love life: seeing what the weather’s like when I look out the window in the morning, doing the gardening, making love, going kayaking, but I am less interested in my career, and my career was basically Luke. I wrote that letter for Ann to send it to my correspondents when I died. I kept it in a file for two years, and one day I decided to send it.”I asked him two more questions. The first: before sending this email, did he throw the dice?“Oh, no, that didn’t even occur to me,” said George. “The dice can be useful when you don’t know what you want. But when you know, what use is it?”Second question: how did his correspondents take the news?He gave his mischievous little laugh. “Well, a few thought it was in bad taste. Aside from them, some thought: ‘That’s George!’ And others: ‘That’s Luke!’“And you, what do you think?”This is an abridged version of “In Search of the Dice Man”, an essay from a new collection 97,196 Words by Emmanuel Carrère, published by Bodley Head on 14 November and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc296d8498f7b83abab9bdafc30fb59e52e5544/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca473551efac5b3b0ad41f4916712a50","title":"how a guardian story led to a landmark case against big tobacco","story":"In June 2018 Sarah Boseley wrote about child labour in the tobacco fields of Malawi.

The alliance is intended to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency.The agreement, which does not include Labour, covers 49 seats in England and 11 in Wales. It was made under the banner of a cross-party group called Unite to Remain, which has spent several months trying to broker the plan.A so-called progressive alliance plan, also including Labour, was attempted before the 2017 election but arrangements were only made for a handful of seats, in part because of the difficulty of getting local parties to agree.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.The template for the Unite to Remain idea was the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection in August, where the decision of Plaid Cymru and the Greens to stand aside helped the Liberal Democrats overturn a Conservative majority of 8,000 to take the seat.Heidi Allen, the Conservative-turned-Lib-Dem MP, who is standing down in December’s election, was involved in organising the Brecon and Radnorshire pact and subsequently co-launched Unite to Remain.Allen said the level of cross-party working was “unprecedented in modern British political history”.She said: “With a single remain candidate in 60 seats we will return a greater number of remain MPs to parliament. This is our opportunity to tip the balance of power away from the two largest parties and into a progressive remain alliance.”Allen had previously said she hoped to create deals in 70 seats, and to avoid standing against some strongly pro-remain Labour MPs.Beyond giving the split of the seats between England and Wales, the group has not provided details of which seats will be involved, although they are billed as stretching from Cornwall to Yorkshire, and from Sussex to north Wales.The majority of candidates given a free run will be Lib Dems given that the party had 20 MPs when parliament was dissolved this week, against four for Plaid Cymru and one for the Greens.Peter Dunphy, the former Lib Dem treasurer who is a director of Unite to Remain, said Brecon and Radnorshire had been a successful test-case of the approach. “People want to back a winner, people want to back a contender,” he said.He conceded that in some cases the remain alliance would be fielding candidates against sitting Labour MPs, but said the group’s main aim was to reduce the number of Brexit-backing MPs in parliament, most of whom were Conservatives. “What we have sought to do is focus on the bigger picture,” he said.Other directors of Unite to remain include Jim Knight, a former Labour MP who is now a peer, and Jessica Simor, a prominent remain-supporting QC.Such alliances have proved problematic in the past because of the perceived unwillingness of parties, especially Labour, to give ground. The Greens expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again.However, a general election dominated by Brexit has focused minds, with some local arrangements already in place. Tthe Lib Dems in Beaconsfield have already announced they will not stand a candidate against the former Tory MP Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/990b6c18992ad150a7846e12493ddad93779bc11/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b53726b0ad577f1fe5a1d809cd3494","title":"should you vote at home or at uni students","story":"UK students can choose to vote in their home constituency or in their term-time area. Find out where your vote could make most differenceWestminster’s first-past-the-post electoral system means that the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins the seat, and votes for other candidates are effectively ignored. For example, if you want Party A to lose but your home constituency is a safe seat for that party, a vote for another party is likely to be wasted. But it may be that your university constituency needs only a few hundred votes for Party B to win the seat.With their option to vote either at home or at university, students have the advantage of being able to choose to cast their ballots where they believe it will have a bigger impact on the overall result. Our tool helps students choose where to vote by pointing to the constituency that in 2017 produced the smaller vote difference between the winning party and the second-placed candidate. We provide the full results for both constituencies, because there may be good reasons why you still prefer to vote in the safer of the two seats (for instance if both of the leading parties in the more marginal seat are unpalatable).This tool only calculates a seat’s marginality at the 2017 election and following byelections. In any given seat there may be other factors in play we haven’t taken account of the most recent polling data or the major political changes, such as the rise of the Brexit party or defections from the two main parties.1. Students can and should register to vote in both places, but it is illegal to vote in both places.2. You can register for a postal vote in your university constituency if you plan to be at home by election day (or vice versa). But to do this you need to register by 5pm on 26 November, or by 5pm on 21 November in Northern Ireland.3. Using the online registration, you will need to complete a full application for each address. VFYF, an apolitical organisation, has been campaigning to get students to register, and to ease the way for educational institutions to help with the effort, but has faced significant hurdles. Spirit says: “Although universities are now required by law to facilitate electoral registration, there is no publicly available data on what each institution is doing to register their students, so there is little incentive for them to do it because there is very low chance that the regulator (the Office for Students) will intervene.”In its effort to make an impact, the campaign cross-referenced data on seat marginality and electoral polls with the share of young people in each constituency, identifying a number of seats in which the youth vote could turn out to make a significant difference. “The way first-past-the-post works means that we don’t have the resources to target those seats where young people’s vote genuinely won’t make a difference,” Spirit says, “but we found that telling young people that they live in a marginal seat jumped participation massively. That’s why we’re targeting those seats.”VFYF’s identification of the seats where the youth vote can have the most impact is shown in the results.

While its long forearms, curved fingers and powerful, grasping thumbs were hallmarks of life spent dangling from branches, the hips, knees and feet were more human-like and better suited to walking upright, the scientists said.“It was astonishing for us to realise during the process of research how similar certain bones were to humans, as opposed to great apes,” said Madelaine Böhme, who led the study at the University of Tübingen. The fossils, which include remains from two females, a male and a juvenile, were excavated between 2015 and 2018.According to Böhme, the findings suggest that our upright posture can be traced to a common ancestor of humans and great apes that lived in Europe rather than Africa. When D guggenmosi was alive, Bavaria was far hotter than it is today, and streams bordered by gallery forests meandered through the region.The clay pit haul of fossils included teeth, pieces of jaw and spine, and a big toe that would have been handy for grasping tree branches. Arguably the most important fossils were a forearm and shin bone, which informed the scientists’ speculation about how the ape moved around.The most complete skeleton, with 21 bones, was thought to belong to a male that stood a metre high and weighed about 30kg. He had a broad chest and the curved, S-shaped spine seen in humans.Measurements of the teeth placed the ape in an extinct group called the dryopithecins, which lived in Europe in the middle to late Miocene, an epoch that lasted from about 23m years ago to five million years ago. Some researchers believe dryopithecins were the ancestors of the ancient African apes who ultimately gave rise to great apes more generally, including the gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists make the case for danuvius employing what they call “extended limb clambering” to get around. Rather than swinging from branches or walking cautiously on branches, extended limb clambering uses both arms and legs equally. “The emerging picture of its locomotion is different from any known living creature,” said Böhme.Tracy Kivell, at the University of Kent, said the fossils were impressive. In an accompanying article, she wrote: “Together, the mosaic features of D guggenmosi arguably provide the best model yet of what a common ancestor of humans and African apes might have looked like. It offers something for everyone: the forelimbs suited to life in the trees that all living apes, including humans, still have, and lower limbs suited to extended postures like those used by orangutans during bipedalism in the trees.”“Danuvius shows skeletal adaptations to a form of bipedalism that is previously unknown and shows that bipedalism evolved much earlier than we previously thought,” Kivell said. “Danuvius is not a fossil hominin, but it does help inform how humans may have evolved.”Some of the most compelling evidence for upright walking in human ancestors comes from Ardipithecus ramidus, a female skeleton dating back 4.4m years that was found in Ethiopia. Ardi, who stood about a metre tall, may not have been the most accomplished of walkers, but much of her skeleton shows adaptations to walking on two feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d87b31d24a6ee8e116d1cc8ef3794c547c5f832/0_292_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e49697afa90ee50450b7a9d0ed5de93","title":"uk work absence due to sickness halved in past two decades","story":"The rate of absence from work due to sickness in people in the UK with no long-term health problems has halved in the past two decades, official figures reveal.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said minor illnesses were the most common cause of absences when all groups of people were taken into account in 2018, accounting for more than a quarter of the more than 141m days missed.The total number of days missed last year because of sickness or injury was equivalent to 4.4 per worker, the ONS said. The previous year saw the lowest figure since the ONS started collecting the figures in 1997.Despite the slight year-on-year rise in 2018, the total number of days lost has remained “relatively flat” since 2010.The ONS noted a rate that was consistently slightly higher among public sector workers but said the figures must be seen in the context of the likelihood of worse sick pay provisions in the private sector.Matt Weston, the managing director of the recruitment firm Robert Half, said the figures provided a “key insight into the wellbeing of the UK workforce and the potential for presenteeism instead of productivity and engagement at work”.He added: “Our recent research revealed that more than one in 10 UK employees are unhappy at work, with many finding their job stressful and reporting dissatisfaction with their work-life balance.

After Hamilton won his sixth drivers’ title last Sunday Berger afforded him perhaps the ultimate accolade.He said: “I have been asked a lot about young drivers coming up, ‘Do you see Senna in them’, and I always say: ‘No, Senna was different, he wasn’t comparable.’ But now Lewis reminds me very much of Ayrton in how he performs every time. Under difficult circumstances, on street circuits, quick circuits, in rain and dry, in reading the race, in being fit, in the politics. Lewis is, like Ayrton, complete.”Berger also complimented Hamilton on bringing F1 to a wider audience. “He has a very special personality,” he added. “Nobody could beat Ayrton’s charm but Lewis, the way he promotes the sport around the world, especially in America and to new audiences, is outstanding too. For me Lewis is the man.”DTM revealed a potential new series that could be part of its championship meetings in future, a move Berger insisted was prompted by the need for motor racing to react to the climate-change emergency.He said: “I have been convinced for several years, but especially recently, that we cannot close our eyes to putting input into improving the environment. In the racing industry it is our obligation to think about it. The result has to be to develop new technologies but also make them interesting to fans. It’s not working if you don’t give the pleasure to the fans, so we have to cover this side and improving the environment.”The proposal is aimed at presenting high-speed, wheel-to-wheel racing by allowing manufacturers to run road-based sports cars but powered by either electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells. The intent is to produce vehicles capable of up to 1,000bhp and speeds of up to 200mph. In comparison the current Formula E car produces 385bhp. Using competing types of technology Berger believes will advance both quicker and help in proving which is worthy of greatest development in future.The series would also use new technology in other areas, employing robots to replace wheels and batteries of fuel cells during pit stops.“We are all aware of the necessity to improve the environment, so we must follow the strongest ideas of where performance could come in the future,” said Berger. “We see electric and we see hydrogen, but nobody knows the best solution. Motorsport can split it up into a way of competition. But one where fans can still see a sportsman capable of driving a machine on the absolute limit better than anyone else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eebfa35791b78e198da1064e1c663304358c052e/102_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f3aa44569ac94072b61711b4d88a310","title":"var celebrations ice hockey genius and a cats nfl touchdown","story":"Also featuring a Nicola Adams tribute, Emily Scarrat being brilliant at rugby and FA Vase scenes1) The yin and yang of goal celebrations: none more modern than this one, from Brazil, in which the Santos forward Marinho mimics a VAR check after scoring but, far away from the world of contentious technology, check out what this last-minute FA Vase equaliser means for Falmouth Town’s players and fans.

So is the satellite broadcaster’s box still the one to beat?When Q launched in 2016 it dragged Sky’s pay-TV platform kicking and screaming into the TV-anywhere age first ushered in by services such as Netflix.There were some great bits, such as the ability to stream your recordings around the house both to Q Mini boxes attached to TVs and to apps on tablets and phones. There were also some not-so-great bits, such as a polarising touch-sensitive remote that some simply couldn’t stand.After three years of maturation, Sky Q has improved in all the right areas while keeping the good bits just the way they were.Sky Q is arguably the best regular TV-watching experience you can get for a couple of key reasons. If you pay the extra £5 a month, proactively everything is in HD, apart from FreeSports, which is in HD exclusively on Virgin. It’s fast to switch in and out of channels and to the guide. You can also edit the TV guide, not only to remove channels you don’t want to see, but to reorder them into your preferred list.I can’t tell you how much of a revelation that has been. No more is there standard definition BBC 1 right at the top – who wants to watch SD content in 2019? My Favourites guide shows me just the channels I want and in an actually logical order.The New Series guide is excellent too, keeping you abreast of the latest shows starting up in the very near future. Go here, set them to record and relax. If you don’t watch TV with adverts – as I don’t – discovering when new things are going to be broadcast is really difficult without something like this.If you’ve bought a 4K UHD TV, and it’s likely you have if you’ve bought practically any new large TV in the last year, then you want things to watch on it. While there are some 4K movies and TV shows on services such as Netflix or Amazon, Sky has the most broadcast and TV show 4K content available.You need the Sky Q Experience pack and the 2TB Sky Q box to get 4K, but you can watch all of Sky’s Premier League games and many English Football League games live in 4K, alongside F1, darts, rugby, boxing and others. The one hole is BT Sport, which is not currently available in 4K on Sky, but is on competitors.TV other than sport is accessed through on-demand in 4K, with a large proportion of TV shows shown on Sky’s various channels are available to download in 4K, including series such as Game of Thrones.Sadly that doesn’t include the traditional terrestrial channels, such as BBC, ITV or Channel 4. The Q box doesn’t support HDR yet, although it is coming. There’s also no way to automatically grab the 4K version as soon as something is recorded, meaning I ended up recording a programme as a placeholder then downloading it in 4K before I wanted to watch it.Sky’s handling of on-demand content is also excellent – seamless and entirely within the same user interface without throwing you out to another app such as iPlayer. Shows are downloaded to the box but you can watch them while they’re downloading, which means there’s no buffering to deal with – great for those without really fast broadband.There’s so much on-demand content that Sky rivals Netflix for binge-watching potential. If you’re watching a box set the next episode will download in the background while you’re watching, meaning it’s ready to go when you are. And with the right package you also get Netflix thrown in, which is searchable alongside everything else.Sky Q had unified search at launch, which worked very well. Voice search has since been added, making it much faster. Hold the button the remote and ask for what you want, be it a show, movie, actor or anything else. It’s so much faster than manually typing out letters.You can also navigate the interface and control playback via voice. Hold the button and say “go home”, “open the TV guide” or “skip 30 minutes” to do so instantly. It’s very slick.Aside from regular TV and sport, Sky’s movie service has moved on somewhat too. While you can certainly watch movies on the various Sky Cinema channels, everything being shown and more is available on-demand, with 200 or so in 4K with Dolby Atmos soundtracks too.There are about 1,000 movies on Sky Cinema at any one time. New ones become available after being in the cinema and after being on pay-per-view services including the Sky Store – Sky’s separate rental or purchase movie service that isn’t included in a Sky Cinema subscription. That means you have to wait some time for the latest blockbusters, and that you could have bought or rented them from Amazon, iTunes, Google Play or Sky before they are included in your subscription.Q changed the way Sky delivered content to multiple TVs, essentially turning the main box into a hub to feed smaller Mini Q boxes or the Sky Q on a smartphone or tablet.The Mini Q boxes remain unchanged and are great for putting Sky on another TV, but only in HD, not 4K. Better is the new Sky Go app, which has superseded the Sky Q app and is available on a wider range of devices, including iPads, iPhones, Android devices and Amazon’s popular Fire tablets.With the Sky Go app you can watch live TV, continue watching recordings in the home or download them to go, or set things to be recorded remotely on Q box. The one thing you can’t do is watch content that was downloaded to the Q box in 4K in the Sky Go app, so you have to stream it directly in HD. You also can’t cast or output it via cable to another screen and there’s no Windows 10 Sky Go app, but you can access some functions in a browser.There may also be set-up fees required and Sky routinely runs offers that discount services for fixed periods. There’s a set 18-month contract for new subscriptions, but some add-ons are rolling 31-day additions.Prices are also different if you take out more than one service with Sky, such as broadband and phone with TV, and often far better value.Sky Q delivers the best possible pay-TV experience in the UK right now. There’s no better place for accessing 4K TV content, which unlike movies is still fairly hard to actually get through other means apart from original shows from Netflix and Amazon.The user interface is modern, fast and nice to use. You can properly edit the TV guide to your liking. On-demand content is handled in a seamless, native way rather than throwing you out into what are effectively smart TV apps. Voice search and control is simple, effective and practically instant. You can watch live, recorded or downloaded TV on your phone or tablet, both inside and outside your home. If you want more you can get Q Mini boxes to attach to secondary TVs, too.The two notable omissions are lack of HDR support and even if you pay extra to access BT Sport, it’s not available in 4K. But the biggest problem is the not inconsiderable price. Like most pay-TV competitors it requires you take everything from one provider (phone, broadband, TV and mobile) to make it better value.With so many over-the-top competitors now, including subscription and pay as you watch options, there’s a question mark hanging over all pay-TV services. Even Sky has one in the form of the cheaper, streaming-only Now TV.But with Sky Q you get what you pay for – a premium TV service with a premium price.Pros: fast box, slick interface, editable TV guide, TV all over your home, large selection of on-demand content + Netflix integration, fully-integrated catch up, excellent voice control, unified search, 4K, Dolby AtmosCons: expensive and complicated pricing, lacks Amazon Prime Video, no HDR, no 4K YouTube This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

They want drivers to helpIt feels a bit Alice in Silicon Valleyland, but the good news for Uber this week was that it lost $1.2bn in the third quarter of 2019. While burning that kind of cash in 90 days would make even WeWork’s Adam Neumann blush, it is an improvement over the previous quarter’s jaw-dropping deficit of $5.24bn.Uber’s latest financial results came just two days before its post-IPO lockup period expired on Wednesday, allowing early investors and employees to cash out and touching off a stock sell-off that saw the share price reach a new all-time low. Hundreds of Uber drivers across California marked the occasion with protests targeting some of the handful of people who have unambiguously benefited from the Uber economy. Drivers visited the home of the early investor and former board member Bill Gurley in Atherton and the $72.5m mansion of the co-founder Garret Camp in Beverly Hills.The company’s fraught relationship with its workforce is only going to get more complicated over the next year, as the fundamental question of Uber’s existence – are drivers employees or independent contractors? – is put to the test in its home state.Uber, together with Lyft and DoorDash, took the first steps this past week to fight back against a landmark bill, AB5, that would jeopardize the contractor status of ride-share and delivery drivers. On 28 October, the three companies filed the paperwork to begin a campaign for a November 2020 ballot measure that would exempt them from the new rules for classifying workers.They were following through on their August pledge of $30m for the initiative – a last-ditch attempt to scare state lawmakers off passage of the bill. The legislature did not blink, and Instacart and Postmates have since thrown in $10m apiece of their own, putting the nascent campaign on track to be one of the most expensive in California history.Uber and Lyft have wasted no time in leveraging their relationships with drivers to advance the campaign. Drivers who log on to Lyft to work are shown a screen urging them to sign up in support of a “ballot measure to preserve your freedom and provide new protections and benefits”, while Uber sent emails urging drivers to “vote yes to protect driver choice and flexibility”.There are no limits on the amount of app-based campaigning like this that Uber and Lyft can do under California law, according to Bob Stern, former president of the Center for Governmental Studies. That means the ride-hail experience in California is likely to become heavily politicized over the next year. Think app notifications urging you to vote or campaign flyers delivered alongside your takeout food. Signature gathering is a quintessential, pre-gig-economy gig in California, and it may be only a matter of time before ride-hail companies begin offering drivers bonuses to carry petitions and gather signatures in their cars.At some point, another fundamental question will need to be answered: is this business model even worth preserving?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6017413bea4235351ea85ba9eb39aa897d3b8ba1/1_0_5369_3223/master/5369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e60ec56fc2d9d3c5d265f7353d8a188","title":"smartphone replace nokia lumia mobile price","story":"Jim doesn’t need a high-end mobile, but would like something he can rely on at a decent priceMy Nokia Lumia 820 smartphone is approaching obsolescence after six years’ use. Apart from that, I used a second-hand iPhone for a week before it failed, but I have never used an Android phone. I am clearly not someone who places a premium on having the latest phone, but I would like something I can rely on. I don’t use phones for music on the go – I still use iPods – and I very rarely watch videos on them: I use my laptop for that. I have a sim-only contract and the idea of spending £700 or so on a phone doesn’t really apply to my wants, needs or financial reality. JimThe Lumia smartphone business was one of Microsoft’s most spectacular – and most expensive – flops. Users loved their Lumias, but there were never enough of them. Also, there weren’t enough apps to attract switchers from Apple and Android. Microsoft’s selling proposition was that developers could write “universal” apps that would run on Windows 10 smartphones and laptops, and on Xbox games consoles, thus reaching hundreds of millions of users. Alas for Microsoft, that idea didn’t attract developers. The company’s new chief executive, Satya Nadella, shut down the smartphone business that the former boss, Steve Ballmer, had bought from Nokia.However, iOS is exclusive to Apple while Android is readily available, so Microsoft will re-enter the smartphone market late next year with its own innovative, dual-screen Surface Duo running Android 10. This is clearly aimed at business users – including people like me – but it does suggest that Android will ultimately offer the best experience with the whole Microsoft ecosystem, including Windows PCs, software and Azure cloud services. This reduces your problem to picking the best mid-range Android phone.But you can certainly get something that will meet your needs for about £200 to £250, if not less. At that price, you lose some processor speed, fast graphics, storage space, and some screen and camera quality. However, all the major brands I’ve seen have been robust enough, and fast enough, for ordinary purposes.One of Motorola’s advantages in the UK market is that it has a venerable American brand name. In fact, the original Motorola was taken over by Google, which sold the phone part to Lenovo, which is Chinese. Rivals such as Xiaomi and Huawei don’t have such venerable names, and Xiaomi was only founded in 2010. However, both outsell Motorola in smartphones, and both have some excellent mid-range models.My colleague Samuel Gibbs, who reviews phones for the , recently picked the Xiaomi Mi A2 as a bargain buy, and at £169 with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage, it still is. The version with 4GB64GB is not such good value at £259, and the gold-coloured model even worse at £319.I’ve put together a comparison of some options at GSM Arena.Microsoft has chosen to go with Google’s Android rather than fork it and do its own version, as Amazon did with Fire OS. However, it already offers Microsoft Launcher (see video) which connects to Your Phone running on Windows 10 PCs. This is not a bad approach for people who want their smartphone to work with their laptop.Some people just want tiles that make their Android smartphones look much like your old Lumia. That shouldn’t be too difficult because you can do it by downloading mostly-free apps from the Google Play store. Tiles can be provided by installing, for example, XinYi’s WP Launcher, ChYK’s Square Home, Spark Planet’s Win 10 Launcher, Win Launcher 2019, or Launchers World’s WP 8 Launcher 2019. There are lots.Both WP Launcher and Square Home 3 are free to install but you may need to make in-app purchases in WP Launcher or upgrade to the highly-rated Square Home Key (£3.89).A few websites have described more extensive customisations, with 7 Labs using WP Launcher, AI Type Keyboard, Messaging 7, WP7 ContactDialer, Windows Phone Notifications and ZPlayer to get something more like a Windows smartphone.

Netflix, which has more than 10 million subscribers in the UK, charges £8.99 for its most popular package.Next week ITV will deliver its third-quarter trading update, which will include guidance on how healthy the all-important, big-spending festive TV advertising season is set to shape up.In September, BritBox announced its first distribution deals to make the streaming service available on services including YouView, Freeview and Samsung TVs. ITV also announced the first content partners for BritBox, with Channel 5 and Comedy Central making hundreds of hours of TV shows available on the service."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d588d88b34bd9193aee3e303c0faffe1c703c411/0_46_5826_3496/master/5826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c824da7a44d9d25e7e90b0fd3ab7103e","title":"tv tonight jez butterworths eccentric britannia is back","story":"What will our assortment of mystics and warrior queens do when faced with a choice between submission to Rome or death?

As we return, Rome has a foothold: the natives appear to be faced with submission to Roman authority or death.

In an op-ed for Der Spiegel published on Wednesday morning, party secretary Paul Ziemiak called the Thuringian leader of the AfD, Björn Höcke, “a Nazi”, arguing that a governing alliance would amount to “a betrayal of our Christian Democratic values”.If the CDU’s Thuringian branch were to cooperate with the AfD, regional politician Werner Henning told Die Welt, it would “tear apart“ the party.Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the letter-writers would “help to make the AfD more socially acceptable.” Already once in German history, Schuster warned, civil politicians had acted as “stirrup holders” for a party run by the far-right.The wrangle over principles and power in the eastern state is part of a wider free-for-all in the party that has governed Germany for 17 out of 24 postwar terms, facilitated by Merkel’s relative absence from the hubbub of domestic politics and her designated successor’s struggle to build a profile.CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer was once seen as Merkel’s successor-in-waiting but has struggled to make her mark, even after taking over the defence ministry in July, not least because her mentor’s support for her policy initiatives has remained lukewarm at best.Friedrich Merz, a conservative of the old guard and darling of the all-powerful Springer media empire, used the poor election results to launch an open attack on Merkel, saying the result was a “vote of mistrust” in her coalition government with the centre left.“We are in a really difficult situation”, said Merz, who came second in the race for the party chair last December. “In my view that has mainly got to do with the chancellor’s inaction and lack of leadership, which has descended on this country like a veil of fog.”The row has seen some of the chancellor’s old allies reach to stab her in the back, while some of her fiercest critics have changed tack to fall in line with her centrist interpretation of the CDU’s role.Health minister Jens Spahn used to be a vocal opponent of Merkel’s stance during the refugee crisis, describing her migration policies as recently as last autumn as “the elephant in the room” that was putting off formerly loyal voters.In an article for the , however, the openly gay politician appears to pitch his tent closer to Merkel’s camp rather than that of her detractors. While continuing the warn of the dangers of “uncontrolled immigration”, the former hardliner now strains for a positive message. “Germany is ageing rapidly,” Spahn writes. “Our message to the people of Mexico, the Philippines and all other nations is: if you share our values and want to work with us, please feel cordially invited!”By contrast, some Merkel loyalists have broken out in open protest against a perceived leadership vacuum at the top. Norbert Röttgen, the chairman of the German Parliament’s foreign relations committee and once seen as one of her allies, told the New York Times: “Germany is now a complete void in everything. I can’t see a European policy, the foreign minister is a void, the chancellor knows everything but does nothing.”At the CDU’s party conference in Leipzig on 22 November, the row threatens to escalate further, with no ceasefire in sight. “The possibility cannot be excluded”, wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung, “that Merkel’s parting from power could also result in the CDU’s parting from the chancellory”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4074644.1573061161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"syrian refugee student wins state scholarship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSuaad Alshleh:  ‘I would say, never lose your ambition, work hard and . . . you’ll get there.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Three years ago Suaad Alshleh, a newly arrived 14-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, arrived in Ireland with dreams of becoming a doctor.This year she secured a place studying medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland after an impressive Leaving Cert which included top marks in chemistry and biology.And on Wednesday, she was was named as the first recipient of a new State scholarship for disadvantaged students studying science in higher education.She was formally awarded the €5,000-a-year scholarship, which recognises the work of Irish Nobel Prize winner Prof William C Campbell, by Minister for Education Joe McHugh.Direct provisionAlong the way, she has faced the kind of challenges few other Irish students could imagine.She and her parents fled Syria in 2011 and relocated to the United Arab Emirates for a few years before seeking asylum with her mother in Ireland in August 2016. They were later joined by the father.They spent nine months in a direct provision centre in Co Monaghan waiting for their papers, after which they moved to Portlaoise.“My mother and I were in a room that wasn’t very big. There’ s the issue of food, I was used to my mom’s cooking . . .“It was probably the hardest time of my life. Those nine months, I’ve kind of blocked them out. But look where I am now. Without that experience, I probably wouldn’t be here. I’m very grateful,” she says.She studied at Mountmellick Community School – because her local school didn’t offer Leaving Cert chemistry – and had to rely on a lift from a neighbour because they didn’t have a car.And she also had to deal with being seen as an “alien” wearing a headscarf in communities which were not always used to ersity.Home nowWhile her experience in direct provision was tough, she has nothing but praise for the support she has received since arriving in Ireland.“It was difficult at first. But I’ve had very positive experiences with the Irish community. I’m very happy to be here. I have loads of Irish friends and wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home now.”Her mother, Wesam Jouma, and father Issam Alshleh – both engineers – watched proudly and took photographs s as she spoke to the media.“It’s a spectacular achievement, we’re so proud,” beamed her mother. “She worked her heart out, that’s it !”As for Suaad, she feels a sense of responsibility: as a member of the Syrian refugee community, she wants to show there are good news stories.“As a Syrian refugee, I’m incredibly grateful for the Irish community as a whole for embracing me as one of their own and supporting and encouraging me, through initiatives like this, to realise my dream of studying medicine.”“I hope to get through this very tough degree. I want to be a successful doctor and am very interested in surgery.”She also wants to send a message to other young people in direct provision or in challenging circumstances.“I would say, never lose your ambition, work hard and . . . you’ll get there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Crona Byrne says her father would have laughed at controversyBusinesses complain of knock on impact of Irish Water boil water noticeGo Safe says bulk of its services will be running despite industrial actionRobust defence to be mounted against claims, says chief of hospital development boardQuinn Industrial Holdings chief Liam McCaffrey says interview with his attacked colleague brought back \u0026lsquoall the horror in one fell swoop\u0026rsquoESRI report finds strong appetite for senior cycle reform among pupils, parents and teachersInvestigation underway after Chihuahuas discovered in the boot of a car at Dublin PortPlans for \u0026lsquoNorman Wexford\u0026rsquo attraction and \u0026lsquoone of great gardens of the world\u0026rsquo in WaterfordLegislation ensures gift cards valid for at least five yearsKyle Duggan (31) sentenced for attacks on elderly men in Cork city centreSite\u0026rsquos visitor numbers have grown steadily from 27,000 in 2016 to over 81,000 in 2019Pilot\u0026rsquos damages case opens before High Court judge and jury"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4074894.1573078493!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord d%C3%A1il voting gerry adams s hair and the never ending tit for tat","story":"There was a noticable increase in TDs in Dáil Eireann to vote on a recent amendment after the fallout from the recent \u0027Votegate\u0027 scandal.  Video: Oireachtas\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Politicians are very privileged to possess a vote in the national parliament and their electorate expects them to exercise it wisely.’ File photograph: The Since the embarrassing revelation that many TDs can’t cope with the onerous task of having to occasionally sit in a designated seat for a couple of minutes and press a button in return for a handsome salary, Dáil votes have become very serious affairs.They will remain so until at least the new year, by which time a drink-addled post-Christmas media may have forgotten this latest episode of Dáil delinquency. Or until a suitable technology is embedded in the voting stalls to prevent deputies voting for themselves and on behalf of others.Votegate, as it became known, shone an unwelcome light on the cavalier attitude of some politicians to doing their Dáil duty. They are very privileged to possess a vote in the national parliament and their electorate expects them to exercise it wisely. Instead, some came to view it as a bothersome chore or an optional extra.Now that the game is up, votes are conducted with a showy display of full care and attention. The Ceann Comhairle calls on everyone to take their seats, precipitating a gallop of the virtuous to their allotted pews. Numbers coming into the chamber – from nearby offices or wherever else – have increased.It looks suspiciously like the party whips have been doing some serious cracking.Take yesterday afternoon, in the middle of a monumentally dull Dáil day when hardly a sinner stirred in the chamber and the public corridors of Leinster House were draped in leaden silence. And yet, when a vote was called late in the afternoon on the minor “Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment ) Bill 2019 – Amendment 5”, there was a rush to the chamber when the bells rang.Not only that, but the turnout included the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, almost every member of Cabinet, leader of Fianna Fáil and a healthy contingent from the main Opposition party. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald wasn’t present , but that didn’t matter as her former leader, Gerry Adams, was garnering most of the attention on the Shinner benches with his new hairstyle.Serious businessOnce the buttons have been pressed and the minute allowed for this is up, the serious business of making sure everything has been properly conducted in accordance with the rules can begin. Sincevotegate, this now involves a swarm of tellers from all representative groups, along with a few officials, clustering around a table on the floor of the chamber and scrutinising the result. There are furrowed brows as they all bend and look at the voting map, before scanning the benches to make sure the right people voted in the right place. There is some very serious counting followed by the mass whipping out of Biros and a frenzy of signing on the dotted lines.As they lean in and look down at the table, the tellers look like a group of road workers peering into a hole. All they are missing is the shovels.Away from shovels and the novelty of voting shenanigans, a never-ending crisis was wheeled out again during Leader’s Questions. The hospital trolley league of limitless shame was contested during another round of fruitless argument between the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil leaders.Comparing trolleys is all they ever do when discussing the crisis in emergency departments.The Taoiseach said as much when Micheál Martin took him to task over the crisis (679 on trolleys countrywide that morning, according to Micheál).“This is a really difficult problem and it has been with us for decades. We know that there are also problems in many other countries as well,” said Leo Varadkar. But they are doing everything possible to deal with the crisis.And anyway, you had more trolleys on your watch when you were minister than I had on mine when I was minister, Leo told Micheál, as Labour’s Brendan Howlin (another former health minister) chortled, “I’m enjoying this history lesson.”Like two stags locking horns, only in this case ramming into each with hospital trolleys. It’s a never-ending, tit-for-tat, who was the worst minister of them all in the pantheon of overall duds.“No disrespect,” said Micheál, but “people are finding it difficult to comprehend this ongoing, sort of robotic, detached response” from the Taoiseach to their emergency department ordeals. There is “a huge disconnect” between what he says in the Dáil, with his facts and figures, and the reality on the ground.“Either we’re not all getting it or the people out there aren’t getting it and you have some insight that no one else has in terms of the reality of people’s experiences in our emergency departments and in our hospitals.”Furthermore, continued the Fianna Fáil leader, he finds Leo’s explanations about the jobs moratorium in health are “becoming very irritating and annoying”.Do something about it. Have “a fundamental reflection and rethink”.On his trolley Leo then climbed up on his trolley. “I don’t mean any disrespect to you either, but your self-righteousness knows no limits. Let’s not forget – I’ll give you some facts – that you were minister for health once,” he began, pushing back at Micheál.“He was a much better one than you . . .” Fianna Fáil’s Fiona O’Loughlin loyally tutted.Leo was on a trolley roll.“And you were famous for chiding Tallaght hospital for not ordering enough trolleys when they were famously treating people in the car park.” Sure he didn’t even know how many people were on the trolleys “those days” because they wouldn’t, even couldn’t count them.“So, you should be off your high horse when it comes to this one.”Michael Healy-Rae (has a horse outside) lost patience with the argument between the two sides which still operate a confidence-and-supply agreement keeping Fine Gael in power.“You wouldn’t have a horse only for Fianna Fáil.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Serving police officer charged with murder of ex-Aston Villa footballer Dalian AtkinsonGeneral election latest news: Former Labour minister Ian Austin urges \u0026#39decent\u0026#39 people to vote for Boris JohnsonEuropean Parliament wants to crush eurosceptics, warns Nigel Farage after ECJ rulingNine Chinese jailed for selling fentanyl to US in first joint probeGeneral Election 2019 poll tracker: Lead for Boris Johnson as campaign beginsAmbushed and massacred by \u0026#39monsters\u0026#39: How a Mormon family became the latest victims of Mexican cartel turf warWhen is the General Election 2019 and when will we know the results? Several injured as Piccadilly Theatre ceiling collapses during Death of a Salesman performanceMalaysia detains Cambodian opposition leader ahead of return from exile Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesCharity launched for UK disasters backed by Duke of Cambridge to give public single donation point they can trustComment: Extinction Rebellion cannot be allowed to become \u0026#39above the law\u0026#39Comment: Iran is winning the war for the Middle East, and the West has no convincing responseComment: The Tories\u0026#39 botched game plan in the Labour heartlands could cost Boris Johnson this electionPrivate school pupils earn 10 per cent more by the time they are 25, study finds\u0026#39It could have been a bloodbath\u0026#39: Checkpoint Charlie as the Berlin Wall fell downMan arrested after 15 people found alive in lorry in WiltshireBreast cancer survivors can halve risk of early death with 20 minutes exercise a day   We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed a level grades versus fees find leading private schools","story":"with ever rising fees, how do you work out which independent school offers the best return on your investment?Does sending your children to a private school mean they will get better A-level grades?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20.

which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandOfficials at the CBI added that output remained flat in the three months to October, and is expected to fall next quarter by 9 per cent.SMEs blamed the political and economic uncertainty abroad as the biggest reason for lacking optimism, followed by import licence restrictions.Jobs in the industry shrunk by 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor the first time since January 2013 and are expected to fall at a similar pace in the next quarter, it added.As a result of the uncertainty, companies said spending on plants and machinery were down 20 per cent, with staff training spends down 25 per cent.Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at CBI, said: “As a first step to lifting the malaise, the next government must get behind business to deliver on a Brexit deal, particularly one that unlocks a smooth transition period.“Then the real heavy lifting can begin on forging a future relationship with our biggest trading partner. Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy’s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandOfficials at the CBI added that output remained flat in the three months to October, and is expected to fall next quarter by 9 per cent.SMEs blamed the political and economic uncertainty abroad as the biggest reason for lacking optimism, followed by import licence restrictions.Jobs in the industry shrunk by 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor the first time since January 2013 and are expected to fall at a similar pace in the next quarter, it added.As a result of the uncertainty, companies said spending on plants and machinery were down 20 per cent, with staff training spends down 25 per cent.Alpesh Paleja, lead economist at CBI, said: “As a first step to lifting the malaise, the next government must get behind business to deliver on a Brexit deal, particularly one that unlocks a smooth transition period.“Then the real heavy lifting can begin on forging a future relationship with our biggest trading partner. Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy’s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That put the UK 31st out of 35 OECD nations in the period since Theresa May unexpectedly lost the Conservatives’ parliamentary majority.Almost every OECD nation has outperformed the UK on exports and levels of investment, which have slowed markedly as a result of uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which compiled the figures, said a decade of austerity, Brexit mismanagement and a fragile global economy had caused a slump in business confidence.\u0026nbspFrances\u0026nbspO’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The UK economy has fallen into the relegation zone – and you have to blame the manager.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and Scotland“When Britain needed to invest, they chose corporate tax cuts. And when Britain needed to rebuild, they chose more austerity.”The picture has been particularly bleak for investment, which fell at an annual average rate of -0.2 per cent\u0026nbspbetween the second quarter of 2017 and the same period this year. By contrast, the rest of the OECD nations averaged 3.4 annual growth during that time.Once public and housing investment is stripped out, UK business investment was even weaker over the period, falling at an annual rate of -1.3 per cent.“We need leaders who will take on the UK’s rigged economy,”\u0026nbspMs O’Grady added. “And we need a plan for world-class public services, modern industry and decent jobs.”Workers have paid the price for lacklustre growth, the TUC said. That claim was supported by separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation, published on Thursday. It forecasts\u0026nbspthat British workers will only see average wages surpass their 2007 peak in November or December this year – finally bringing an end to the longest period of stagnant wages in 200 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a big living standards milestone and a relief for households after an unprecedented pay downturn.“But politicians tempted to use the return of ‘peak pay’ to claim that Britain ‘has never had it so good’ should remember that pay for millions of workers is still below pre-crisis levels, and that our pay downturn has left average pay £138 a week off track.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is designed to allow people to make and receive payments through Facebook-owned apps like Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, which are used by billions of people around the world.Since its unveiling, however, Libra has faced significant resistance from financial regulators in the US and Europe. In September, French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire\u0026nbspsaid that he would block the development of Libra and France as it posed a threat to monetary sovereignty.Bitcoin’s record price surge of 2017 was caused by a single personPoliticians in the UK have expressed similar reservations, with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Chair Damian Collins claiming that Libra represents Facebook\u0027s attempt to turn itself into its own country.Several of the payments firms that Facebook worked with in the early stages of Libra\u0027s development, such as Mastercard and Visa, also recently dropped out.In China, plans for a state-backed cryptocurrency appear to be moving forward as the country\u0027s central bank prepares for a launch expected in the coming months.Last week, President Xi Jinping hailed bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology as an important breakthrough, marking an about-turn in the country\u0027s official stance on cryptocurrency.All negative sentiment towards the technology also appears to have been purged from Chinese social media, with cryptocurrency news resource CNLedger\u0026nbspnoting that articles saying blockchain technology is a scam are now banned.A new law coming in to effect on 1 January will also serve to facilitate the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 1046 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1546 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1846 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2146 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2346 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272646 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3746 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3846 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3946 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Arriving in the wake of Marvel’s Black Panther, the film highlights the links between the saga of the real-life Agoji women, who fought in the former Kingdom of Dahomey (located in modern-day Benin), and the all-women comic-book world protectors known as Dora Milaje.The writer Jack Thorne says his latest four-part drama, which explores the aftermath of a disaster on a small community, was shaped by the Grenfell Tower fire. Rather than overcrowded west London, his takes place in Glyngolau, a fictional run-down town in Wales. A new building project, The Light, is being built on the outskirts. It’s unclear what The Light is, exactly, which is deliberate. The point is not what it is, exactly, but what it represents: 1,000 new jobs and a rare moment of economic optimism for families who have forgotten what hope feels like.Watching Seven Worlds, One Planet, it’s hard to know what to worry about most: the future of wildlife – catastrophically imperilled by our fondness for fossil fuels, long-haul travel and convenience food – or Attenborough himself, now 93 and one of the few people that the world will listen to about the impending apocalypse. Like the species on whose behalf he speaks, his continued existence is vital for us all.Hailee Steinfeld is perfectly cast. She has a face – and a set of elastic expressions – that feels both well-suited to a period piece (as first displayed in her Oscar-nominated role in True Grit in 2010), and resolutely out of place in it. Just as Emily Dickinson was. Steinfeld crackles with charm and impropriety.Click through to see the best TV shows of 2019 (so far) “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 346 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 446 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 646 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 746 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 1046 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1546 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise.

Now is the time to put country before party, to put people before politics, and to embrace the common good, said Mr Price.With Johnson and Corbyn, all we get is more Brexit chaos, continued crisis and paralysis, and Wales at the back of the queue. But to end the chaos through a People’s Vote, to build a new Wales, and to put Wales first, it’s us.Mr Bartley said: “This is about recognising how damaging Brexit would be - for people and for the environment - and ensuring there is as much representation of Remain parties in the next Parliament as possible.\u0026nbsp“Our country is at a crossroads and this election must be the point at which we start to move in a better direction.

That put the UK 31st out of 35 OECD nations in the period since Theresa May unexpectedly lost the Conservatives’ parliamentary majority.Almost every OECD nation has outperformed the UK on exports and levels of investment, which have slowed markedly as a result of uncertainty surrounding Brexit.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Trades Union Congress (TUC), which compiled the figures, said a decade of austerity, Brexit mismanagement and a fragile global economy had caused a slump in business confidence.\u0026nbspFrances\u0026nbspO’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The UK economy has fallen into the relegation zone – and you have to blame the manager.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and Scotland“When Britain needed to invest, they chose corporate tax cuts. And when Britain needed to rebuild, they chose more austerity.”The picture has been particularly bleak for investment, which fell at an annual average rate of -0.2 per cent\u0026nbspbetween the second quarter of 2017 and the same period this year. By contrast, the rest of the OECD nations averaged 3.4 annual growth during that time.Once public and housing investment is stripped out, UK business investment was even weaker over the period, falling at an annual rate of -1.3 per cent.“We need leaders who will take on the UK’s rigged economy,”\u0026nbspMs O’Grady added. “And we need a plan for world-class public services, modern industry and decent jobs.”Workers have paid the price for lacklustre growth, the TUC said. That claim was supported by separate analysis from the Resolution Foundation, published on Thursday. It forecasts\u0026nbspthat British workers will only see average wages surpass their 2007 peak in November or December this year – finally bringing an end to the longest period of stagnant wages in 200 years.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a big living standards milestone and a relief for households after an unprecedented pay downturn.“But politicians tempted to use the return of ‘peak pay’ to claim that Britain ‘has never had it so good’ should remember that pay for millions of workers is still below pre-crisis levels, and that our pay downturn has left average pay £138 a week off track.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Authorities have been raising awareness of the scheme for a number of weeks, and doubled the fine for non-compliance to 4,000 rupees (£43).Mr Kejriwal wrote on Twitter that he car-pooled to work with two cabinet colleagues. “Share cars. This will build friendship, strengthen relationships as well as save petrol and reduce pollution,” he wrote. Another minister rode to work on a bicycle, according to NDTV.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s mostly the stubble burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana which contributes to the pollution, and industrial pollution is also high.”Over\u0026nbspthe weekend, the chief minister of Punjab wrote to the prime minister Narendra Modi urging him to intervene in the crisis and criticising the “blame game” played by the various devolved governments of the region in order to avoid responsibility for action.“The harsh truth is that while all of us are busy conveniently passing the buck to one another, Delhi’s people are reeling from excruciating misery, and are facing one of the worst health disasters in the nation’s, possibly the world’s, history,” wrote Amarinder Singh.The air pollution crisis in the capital is certainly bad for India’s image internationally, with the smog literally overshadowing a T20 series opener between India and Bangladesh in Delhi on Sunday.And oft-cited WHO figures show India is home to 15 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world, despite the accolades won by Mr Modi for his perceived successes on environmental matters.With all eyes turning to the prime minister, Mr Modi’s office is yet to take a strong stand on the pollution issue, even after a Supreme Court-mandated panel declared a public health emergency in the capital last week.The prime minister’s office called an urgent review meeting on the smog on Sunday, after which it was concluded that the cabinet secretary, Rajiv Gauba, would “monitor” the situation.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma. But the blighter Bercow has gone at last.Long live the new Speaker, whoever he or she may be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang. Go figure.Seven Worlds, One Planet cutting and pasting that horrendous old footage of the sky-ing walruses.A BBC continuity woman deciding His Dark Materials is our “new Sunday night obsession”. .The slyly partisan One Show featuring a film with Corbynista Ken Loach calling for “real change”, on the day the election was called.And arch-luvvie David Tennant describing the responsibility of murdering one Proclaimers song for Children In Need: Got It Covered as: “A bit like National Service.”For you or the viewers, David THE guessing games begin as soon as the opening credits for BBC’s big new Sunday night drama kick in and reveal it’s set in a parallel universe.A place where relationships between humans and their animal soul-mates are unusually close.Swindon “Oxford.”Oooh, close, but no cigar at the start of His Dark Materials, an epic, eight-part adaptation of author Philip Pullman’s trilogy that’ll probably go down well with anyone who’s read the books and loves fantasy adventure.Unfortunately, I haven’t read the books and hate fantasy adventure.My loss, I realise. It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just ask anyone old enough to remember British Rail.While dinosaurs Corbyn and McDonnell play fantasy politics, aspirational young working class voters have more realistic priorities. Such as wanting reductions in income tax and stamp duty.There is so much more at stake in this general election than just the threat Labour poses to Brexit.DOES anyone know what Labour’s position on Brexit is Jeremy Corbyn claims to have told his squabbling shadow cabinet to fall in behind him and toe the party line.Whether Corbyn will let the voters know what that agreed position is before the election is another matter.Given Labour fought the last election promising to respect the referendum result and has done everything possible since to thwart it, we doubt it.It is suggested Labour would try to renegotiate with the EU for a closer trading partnership , then hold another referendum.What they would do about the inevitable deadlock is anyone’s guess. Meanwhile, several Labour front-benchers have suggested they would campaign for Remain.One union leader has branded them “ludicrous”. The fudges and fence-sitting may have worked for Corbyn in  but surely it won’t fool voters again. For now though, his indecision is final.NO sooner have doctors pleaded with politicians on all sides not to weaponise the NHS than Labour is caught peddling yet more health lies.Wrong.

It really wasn’t anything but that.”But at the time of the ban, Cleveland Rape Crisis Center president and CEO Sondra Miller said: “It really pushed the line of consent.The character in the song is saying ‘no’, and they’re saying, ‘Well, does no really mean yes ’. “What we know is consent is ‘yes’ andyou get a ‘no’, it means ‘no’ and you should stop right there.”Let’s hope she’s never listening to the radio when Fire by The Pointer Sisters comes on. “You’re pullin’ me close, I just say no, I say I don’t like it, but you know I’m a liar.”Then, next verse: “You’re takin’ me home, you say you want to stay, I say I want to be alone . . . but you know I’m a liar.”Is she a “liar” who’s simply pretending she doesn’t have the hots for him when secretly she does  Or is she a victim being coerced into thinking that about herself by a controlling lover Discuss. While we still can. Or what about the Rolling Stones classic Under My Thumb, about a girl “who once pushed me around” but now, “It’s a squirmin’ dog who’s just had her day, Under my thumb, A girl who has just changed her ways” Far better, surely, to put it all out there so our kids can learn the vital le skill of rational and informed debate.A rock ’n’ roll twist, perhaps, on the premise of Shakespeare’s The Taming Of The Shrew, in which Petruchio uses a number of tactics to bring his we Katherina to heel — or is that now banned too In today’s “attention economy”, keyboard warriors desperate to be heard appear to be scouring the airwaves for even the merest whf of potential offence and, worse still, some are seeing their confected high dudgeon rewarded with a ban.And it’s not just the music industry having its chain yanked. This week it emerged that several theatres will be dropping the traditional “Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats,” instruction to avoid offending any transgender customers.Sigh. Of all the things in the world to truly feel offended by, is this really a priority  Even Barack Obama, the darling of the liberal classes, feels that the call-out culture sometimes goes too far.“The world is messy. There are ambiguities,” said the former US President during a recent interview about youth activism. This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff . . . you should get over that quickly.”He went on to address the “cancel culture” on social media where someone who has said or done something to which others object is immediately shut down in a wave of judgmental condemnation.“That’s not activism. That’s not bringing about change,” he added. “If all you’re doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far. That’s easy to do.”Hear hear. So, by all means, write new songs through the prism of #MeTooyou so wish. But banning or airbrushing the classics to suit modern sensitivitiesdoes us all a disservice.Far better, surely, to put it all out there so our kids can learn the vital le skill of rational and informed debate.“Jo Swinson: Britain’s Next Prime Minister”is the headline on just one of the many missives – a six-page, A booklet.Under Electoral Commission rules, each party can spend up to £, for each constituency it contests.She must be nearing that on my house alone.IRON Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson has split from we Paddy after  years and moved in with a “superfan”.Bruce, , who has an estimated fortune of £million, is now shacked up in Paris with Leana Dolci, who has followed his band for ten years and recently attended a heavy-metal festival in a T-shirt that read: “I fancy the lead singer.” Subtle.When plugging his autobiography a couple of years ago, Bruce told an interviewer he tried to keep his private le out of the public gaze.“So I made the decision that, in amongst not being horrid to people . . . I also don’t want to tell confidences about other people’s lives,” he said.Bruce can only hope his estranged we shares the same view.THIS Halloween, famous fancy dress supplier Smfys boasted on its website, “Looking hot has never been so easy,” while offering a range of saucy outfits from devil cheerleader to Miss Whiplash and sexy skeleton.In my twenties, it was an old bedsheet with a couple of eye-holes.

It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was in full political mode, denouncing Corbyn as a friend of Russia and boasting of advances under the Tories. Yet from hospitals to immigration his hardline attacks just don’t ring true - or left key details out. And he even got the number of days he’s been in office wrong. Here are the  biggest lies and deceptions he told on the first day of the campaign. WHAT HE SAID: It has been frankly mind-boggling in the last few weeks to see how parliament first voted to approve this deal, and then voted for delay. THE FACTS: Parliament did not vote to approve the PM’s Brexit deal. Instead it backed the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Despite its name, second reading is basically the first hurdle a Bill goes through on the long road to becoming law. Often MPs back a Bill at second reading to secure a debate, but then vote against at a later pointit isnapost amended to be acceptable - and several said they would have done so in this case.   . Heaposs building  new hospitalsWHAT HE SAID:  new hospitals. THE FACTS: Boris Johnson ’s promise of  ‘new hospitals’ will actually only deliver six unless the Tories win the next two elections - not one future election, but two. And it includes renovations of existing hospitals.WHAT HE SAID: Go with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, because thataposs the only alternative, who actually want to ban OFSTED, that protects kids from bullying. THE FACTS: Labour would scrap Ofsted - but in what you might think is a key detail, it would be replaced with a new two-phase inspection system. The party says all schools will be subject to regular ‘health checks’ by councils, with a more in-depth inspection led by Her Majesty’s Inspectors concerns arise. . Labour will have no controls on immigrationWHAT HE SAID: Go with Labour and a totally uncontrolled and unlimited immigration system that would put huge pressure on the NHS and other services. THE FACTS: This relates to a motion that members passed at the party conference, not a manesto pledge. However, even that motion didnapost vow to scrapallcontrols - it pledged to extend free movement and reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps targets. While this is of course a big reduction in controls, it wonapost necessarily become Labour policy going into the election as that is decided by scores of party chiefs in a aposClause Vapos manesto approval meeting. WHAT HE SAID: Corbyn would spend the whole of  having two referendums. One on Scotland – because he has done a deal with the Scots nationalists to assist the break up of the unionthey sustain him in power. THE FACTS: Labour recently ruled out allowing a Scottish independence referendum in . A spokesman said: In the early years, in the formative years of a Labour government, we wouldn’t agree to such a request. But in the longer runthere was a democratic and properly formulated request on the basis of a majority of the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish Government it would be wrong to block it.

Promising to build , Starter Homes and building zero In , Conservative Party manesto committed to “, Starter Homes, which will be sold at a % discount and will be built exclusively for first-time buyers under the age of ”. The  Spending Review subsequently provided £. billion to support the delivery of , Starter Homes So how many of the promised homes have been built I hear you ask     None, not one. And according to the National Audit Office, the Tory government paid £million for sites which it then didnapost build any houses on. John Healey, Labouraposs shadow housing secretary, said the Conservative Party had wasted four years and spent millions of pounds. . They spent £, to mislead people about Universal CreditThe DWP published a series of adverts they claimed outlined “myths” about Universal Credit alongside information they claimed was the truth.And they spent £, of taxpayeraposs cash to do it - taking out space in thenewspaper. But an investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority found the ads breached the advertising code  times. In a scathing ruling, the Advertising Standards Authority said a boast that UC “works” because claimants move into work faster was unsubstantiated, exaggerating and misleading.    For their part the DWP say they considering whether to ask for a review of the decision. A DWP spokesman said: We are disappointed with this decision and have responded to the ASA. “We consulted atwith the ASA as we created the adverts, which have explained to hundreds of thousands of people how Universal Credit is helping more than . million people across the country. . They botched privatising probation - and then had to pay to fix it The government was forced to take the supervision of offenders in England and Wales back in-house after a five-year part-privatisation project ended in failure. Low and medium-risk cases had been handled by private probation firms since , but were handed back to the public National Probation Servicein .    The reforms were found to have led to skyrocketing numbers of released offenders ing to prison for breaching their licence conditions after serving short sentences. The Government was forced to spend £ million to scrap contracts with a string of private probation firms in . Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office , said the government set itself up to fail in how it approached the reforms. . They failed to investigate Islamophobia in their own party In May this year, the Muslim Council of Britain wrote to the Equality and Human Rights Commission demanding they investigate hostility to Muslims in the Tory Party. They cited evidence of Islamophobia amongst Members of Parliament, an atmosphere of hostility against Muslim Conservative Party member and the scale of Islamophobia in the party.During the partyaposs leadership contest Sajid Javid bounced the other leadership candidates into holding an inquiry into the issue.But nothing has happened.   Michael Gove , just days before the election said: We will have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia and it will be established before the end of the year.But Boris Johnson has been clear it won’t just be about Islamophobia, and will instead be a broader look at lots of dferen prejudice. Critics say this waters it down. Months after the scandal was brought to light the Tories havenapost done much to investigate the allegations of systemic Islamophobia. Party chiefs have also repeatedly refused to reveal how many members they had suspended over alleged Islamophobia, despite a string of cases being reported to the party. . Slashed police numbers by over , According to Home Office figures, the number of police officers dropped from just under , in  to , in .Now Boris Johnson has said heaposll recruit an extra , police officers in England and Wales.If that happens - which isnapost guaranteed - all it would do is partially reverse cuts that the Tories are responsible for. . Tried to sign ferry contracts with a company that didnapost own any ferries The Tories signed acontract for post-Brexit ferries, with a company that didnapost own any ferries. Seaborne Freightaposs £.m deal fell apart after the firm was mocked for lacking ships and apparently copying terms and conditions from a takeaway website. Kentaposs Port of Ramsgate, where the services to Ostend were meant to depart, wasnapost even ready for the non-existent ships.  Then Transport Secretary and all-around Ministerial failure Chris Grayling swung fully behind the firm, claiming the deal was no problem because itaposs a new start-up business and the contract was tightly-drawn-up. Weeks later, the Department for Transport admitted: It became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements with the Government. Money was blown on government lawyers drawing up the contract. . Left grieving families without bereavement benefits People who lose their partner before pension age can claim a Bereavement Support Payment - worth up to £,, plus £ a month for  months. But couples must be married or in a civil partnership to qualy - which deprives the benefit to , cohabiting couples with children each year.  They won a victory in August , when the Supreme Court ruled the situation was incompatible with human rights law. But  months later - the situation hasnapost improved leaving thousands of people in desperate situations after the loss of a loved one. Bereavement Support Payments launched in  as a fair replacement for the old system but have been slammed for hitting thousands of families with cuts. That is because while % were estimated to be better off than under the old system, % were worse off. The DWP said MPs had already fully debated whether to allow unmarried couples to claim when the benefit was approved. A DWP spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting people during bereavement and with the introduction of Bereavement Support Payment in April , have widened the support available. This is, in addition, to help provided for co-habiting couples through the wider welfare system. . Universal Credit led to people selling sex to survive The Toriesapos flagship benefit change Universal Credit led to women selling sex in order to survive, according to MPs. A number of women told the work and pensions committee they turned to sex work because their benefits payments did not cover their basic needs. The Work and Pensions Select Committee said problems with the system, including a five-week wait for the first payment, left some women to rely on sex work.  A DWP spokesperson said it was committed to providing a safety net for the most vulnerable in society and had made improvements to universal credit, including extending advance payments, removing waiting days and allowing claimants to continue to be paid housing benefit for two weeks after moving on to universal credit. . They abandoned women hit by rise in the state pension age From November  women in the UK began to qualy for their state pensions at the same age as men - currently . That threshold will go up to  by , and to  by . But women born in the s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. The High Court disagreed and ruled in the governmentaposs favour.    But in July, Mr Johnson had promised toto this issue with fresh vigour and new eyes and see what I can do to sort it out. But since he was elected Tory leader he has not offered any new help to the women, In fact, he has only said that we are indeed looking at what more we can do to satisfy that issue . The benefit change that affected almost , children The Toriesapos two-child limit on benefits pushed millions of children deeper into poverty and meant , children went unsupported according to experts. Pioneered by welfare-slashing former Chancellor George Osborne, the limit prevents parents claiming Child Tax Credits or Universal Credit for third or subsequent children born after  April  - a cut of up to £, per child. That forces families to share the same budget they had for two children among three, four or more. Official figures show most families affected are already in work, making a mockery of Tory claims that the change is to encourage people into the job market.    In June, a study by the Child Poverty Action Group found those affected felt strongly that the two-child limit unfairly punished hard-working low-income families at a time – the birth of a child – when they most needed support. They claimed it would push an additional , children into poverty by , while  million children already below the breadline will be pushed into deeper hardship. Speaking at the time a government spokesman said: “This policy helps to ensure fairness by asking parents receiving benefits to face the same financial choices as those in work. Safeguards are in place and we’ve made changes this year to make the policy fairer.” In its final report before the election, the Commons Work and Pensions select committee said it said the two-child cap should be scrapped. . Tried to make it harder to get justice in Employment tribunals In  the government introduced new fees of up to £, for launching tribunals against rogue bosses - in a drive to resolve issues more quickly, outside the court system. But an impact review showed there had been a % drop in the number of cases since they were introduced.    Low-paid women, especially those treated unfairly when they were pregnant or on maternity leave, were the biggest losers, an analysis by Unison found. Finally, in July  the Supreme Court ruled the fees were unlawful, forcing the government to repay £million to around ,. Top judges ridiculed the government’s misunderstanding of “elementary economics, and plain common sense”. . Massive hikes to tuition fees University tuition fees were raised from a maximum of £, a year to £, under the Tory-Lib Dem Coalition. Since then they have been raised again after universities won permission to lt the £, cap with inflation. And reports suggest the Tory manesto does not include a pledge to cut fees . Failed to invest in public health - leading to a reported , preventable deaths According to the IPPR , deaths intEngland since  could have been preventedpublic health policy had not stalled as a direct result of cuts. The think tank claimed that had progress continued at pre  levals that around , lives could have been saved.    IPPRaposs Dean Hochlaf said in June: “We have seen progress in reducing preventable disease flatline since . At the same time, local authorities have seen signicant cuts to their public health budgets, which has severely impacted the capacity of preventative services. “Social conditions for many have failed to improve since the economic crisis, creating a perfect storm that encourages harmful health behaviours. This health challenge will only continue to worsen.” . Made rape victims prove their ordeal A rule grimly nicknamed the rape clause was introduced in April  as part of cuts to tax credits. As weaposve mentioned, claimants can now only be paid tax credits for their first two children, with exceptions for twins or children born of rape. So raped mums must fill out an -page government form in order to claim benefit for their child. Earlier this year the Work and Pensions SecretaryAmber Rudd said: Iaposve been through the form myself and talked to the department about whether weaposve got it right. I believe we have. The form requires a third party, probably Womenaposs Aid or Refuge, to join with the woman who is filling in the form. But otherwise apart from that itaposs almost a self-declaration. . Scrapped nursesapos bursaries In his  spending review, George Osborne unveiled “disastrous” plans to scrap £,-a-year grants for student nurses and midwives. It was supposedly done to allow more training places to open up. But hours after the policy was announced, unions warned us it could prompt a recruitment crisis.  Figures from February  showed that applications had dropped by %. The RCN has warned that the NHS Long Term Plan won’t have a chance to succeedthe decline in student nurse applications isn’t reversed The College urged the Government to invest at least £bn a year in nurse higher education in England to overturn the trend. . Tried to bring back fox hunting As one of his first acts after winning an outright majority in , David Cameron tried to weaken the Hunting Act.The law banning fox hunting was introduced under Labour and has huge public support, according to polls.But ex-PM Mr Cameron wanted to weaken it so an unlimited number of dogs, not just two, could flush a fox from undergrowth.  Activists said that would render the law almost useless, becausehounds rip apart a fox it can be called an accident.In the end the vote was ditched after the SNP went against convention to oppose it .. Cracked down on trade unions standing up for things like not dying at work Passed in summer  after a bitter battle, the Trade Union Act was a wide-ranging crackdown on workersapos rights. It banned strikes unless % of all union members eligible to vote choose them - not % of those who vote, as before.This meant the threshold to strike is now much higher than the threshold to run the country after a general election.The law will also strangle funding to Labour by making union members aposopt-inapos to political donations.Slamming the changes to political funds, Jeremy Corbyn accused the Tories of trying to create a “Zombie democracy” built around a “one-party state”.. Slashed green subsidies In  the Tories slashed funding for small household solar  by %. A £m drop in aposfeed-in tarfsapos was confirmed after critics said the scheme had benefited middle-class families. But Labouraposs shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy said the cuts would cost jobs, hold back a growing industry and undermine progress on climate change.  New onshore wind farms were also excluded from a subsidy scheme from . And the sell-off of the Green Investment Bank was announced in April , prompting fears from the Lib Dems and Green Party that its help for the environment could be weakened. . Tried to impose fees for court cases More than  magistrates quit in disgust at court fees which led to accusations the Tories were trying to force poorer criminals to plead guilty. They hit small-time criminals of flat fees of up to £, - on top of any fines or compensation - which were five times lowerthey pleaded guilty. The fees were introduced in  and were eventually scrapped just a few months later after outrage across the Justice system. . Cut inheritance tax for the rich The Conservatives won the  election promising to fix the roof while the sun is shining. But there was one way they were happy to loosen the purse strings - inheritance tax.  One of George Osborneaposs first acts when he ed as Chancellor was to let couples leave £, more in property after they die . That means a total of £million can now be left inheritance-tax-free, benefiting just , families, according to estimates. The move was set to cost nearly £billion a year, cash Labour says should be spent on schools and hospitals.. Gutted school fundingFour out of five state schools will be worse off next year according to teaching unions. The Tories claim theyaposll invest £billion in schools over the next three years, but the unions in the School Cuts coalitions say there will still be a shortfall of £.billion compared to  levels. That means more schools closing early, cutting classes and reducing the number of teaching hours. Kevin Courtney, the National Education Union general secretary said in Seprember: “Johnson has made lots of empty promises on school funding – but his numbers don’t add up. The latest funding announcement falls well short of settling the shortfall for every child. And crucially it fails to reverse the cuts schools have suffered since .” . Introduced the Benefit Cap As part of a bid to slash welfare spending, the Tories introduced the Benefit Cap, a cash limit on the amount of support a person could recieve,Launched in , the cap - £, in London and £, outside - has been blamed for social cleansing of inner-city areas. The idea was that it would always pay to work.Except not everyone can go out to work - because of poor health or caring responsibilities.MPs have begged the government to apply it only to those expected to look for work.

The new Speaker of the House of Commons’ daughter, Natalie, regularly gave him vividly coloured pairs as birthday and Christmas gts.But she took her own le aged just , during what was described at the inquest as a “toxic relationship”. “Natalie used to buy me bright socks,” Sir Lindsay says, looking down at his ankles. “The rest of the family started now she’s gone. “She also gave us a sparkly pink collar for Betty, our Patterdale terrier. I wasn’t going to take her out in that – and then [Natalie] died and we wouldn’t take her for a walk in anything .”    That this Speaker’s gaudy socks have become as much of a trademark as predecessor John Bercow’s lurid ties, is a touching tribute to the child cruelly snatched from him in . Elected by MPs on Monday as First Commoner of the Land – Westminster’s th Speaker – his vulnerability shows even the most successful politicians, are real people who feel pain. “It’s hard, even hard now,” the -year-old MP for Chorley, Lancashire, admits, swallowing to suppress his emotions. “Natalie was a light so bright – I could never have expected what happened. “I’ll never get over it. I need to deal with it but it’s unbearable never to get a call saying, ‘Pops, what you doing ’ “It’s not right. We lost a daughter, my other daughter a sister and my grandchildren lost an auntie.”  Inside the imposing state rooms of Speaker’s House – the living quarters that come with the job – he admits conversations with other MPs who have lost children help him cope. “It won’t get better but it gets easier, they told me,” he says before his voice trails away.The most avuncular MP in Westminster, twice-married Sir Lindsay is the son of Doug Hoyle, a former Warrington MP now Labour peer, who watched him being dragged to the chair in a piece of archaic Parliamentary pantomime. He will have to get used to being a TV star, shouting “Order” during Prime Minister’s Questions.Yet despite being a straight talker in his  years as Bercow’s senior deputy, Sir Lindsay admits he finds it dficult to speak openly about how his feelings. “It’s hard, especially for Lancastrian lads who don’t like to talk publicly.”  Sir Lindsay describes Westminster as a village even though its , pass holders make it a sizeable town. And he will introduce a part-time GP’s surgery so everybody from security staff to lords can receive medical care on site. “We’ve a hairdresser’s but not a doctor – that can’t be right and I’m not against hairdressing,” he says. Having spent a decade chairing debates without pushing his own politics, he won’t say how he voted in the Europe referendum, this political veteran is less abrasive than Bercow. And he is keen to embrace tradition by bringing back the wig and buckled shoes worn for centuries on state occasions before Bercow dropped them. “When I was mayor of Chorley, the things they made me put on mean they’ll hold no fears for me,” he says. Sir Lindsay ran a company printing logos on police and ambulance unorms before winning his seat from the Tories in Tony Blair ’s  landslide.He would clash with Blair on university tuition fees and had a populist eye, once calling for Heathrow to be renamed in memory of Diana Princess of Wales. At heart, though, he was and still is a trade union activist, admired for treating the most junior staff with respect. Asked what makes him angry, the reply is immediate and clear. “I don’t like bullies and injustice.” Recalling an incident when a tearful waitress in the Commons tea room approached him about being poorly treated by a female MP, he says: “She came up to me really upset. “‘Mr Hoyle’ she said, can I have a word with you’. ‘Of course’, I said.  “She told me, nearly in tears, nobody had spoken to her like that before. “I promised it would be dealt with and I went to see the chief whip and it was. There’s no excuse for bullying. I don’t care what caused it. Whatever it was doesn’t make it acceptable. “Every member of staff is as important to me as the Clerk of the House. “I was touched they had come to see me and they can, any time. I suppose it’s the old trade unionist in me, standing up for what’s right and against wrong.” Being named after Australian cricketer Lindsay Hassett, from the “Invincibles” who whitewashed England in , helped, he chuckles, make him stronger. “When you go to school with farmers’ sons called John and Steven it doesn’t half toughen you up to be called Lindsay. “I was the boy called Sue of the song. You don’t know the stick I’ve had. “I still get mistaken for a woman. I’ll go to a hotel and say I’ve got a room booked and they’re expecting a woman.”  The mistakes continued when Sir Lindsay was elected, with his inclusion on a banner made by women in politics campaign group Emily’s List and an invite to join the Labour women’s group. “I was asked to contribute to a book to support the fight against breast cancer but they didn’t use the photo I sent.” As a lad he was sent to the Bolton private secondary school his mum had attended and “absolutely hated it”. “I wanted to be with my friends,” he says If I had my time over, never again.” Through it all the Labour party has been a lelong passion so leaving – Speakers are have to demonstrate independence – was “a toughie”, he admits. “I went to my first Labour conference in  as a baby and soon after, in Scarborough, I was throwing bacon from the high chair at Hugh Gaitskell. I was an early rebel. “I still don’t accept I’ve resigned. The membership card’s in my pocket. I haven’t chopped it up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror tories busy proving","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: The Tories are busy proving they are unfit for governmentThe resignation of Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s callous Grenfell comments and James Cleverly caught doctoring a campaign videoShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  NOV Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video james-cleverly-questioned-doctored-video-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics voice-mirror-tories-busy-proving-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Shortly before am the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at the st Field of Remembrance at the central London place of worship.    It was the seventh time His Royal Highness has attended the event but the first time for The Duchess of Sussex. The Royals met veterans from all areas of the Armed Forces who have served in past campaigns and more recent conflicts. Amongst those in line to meet the Duke and Duchess were  D-Day veterans.

Mark, , and Ruth Chalmers, , used some of their winnings to fund their daughter Natalie’s IVF treatment after she had tried for six years to conceive. Their daughter had “given up hope” of becoming a mum after suffering fertility problems and enduring five operations. The “devastated” -year-old was unable to get IVF on the NHS as her partner, Nigel Armitage, , had children. But her dreams came true after her parents scooped £million in the EuroMillions raffle in February .  Today, Mr and Mrs ­Chalmers, of Halax, West Yorks, said their first grandchild was “better than winning the lottery”. The first decision they made after their win was to fund her £, IVF treatment. Two months later she was pregnant after her first attempt and on December  last year Koby was born. Ruth, a former wages clerk at Tesco, said. “I never thought I’d have a grandchild. It was heartbreaking to watch what Natalie went through for six years. I’ve seen her in tears and in pain.  “If I could have done, I’d have had one for her, but it wasn’t possible. I thought it was so unfair that because of where she lived she couldn’t get IVF on the NHS. I never thought the day would come I’d be able to take that pain away.” Ruth remembers the call that changed her le, saying: “I was in China with my niece on holiday and Natalie called to say, ‘I can’t believe it, the first time and it’s worked – you’re going to be a grandma’. We both burst into tears.” Dad Mark said Natalie couldn’t stop crying when she called him. He said: “In between tears I heard, ‘I’m pregnant’. I asked her, ‘Why the hell are you crying ’.”  Mark had just taken early retirement after  years with Mars when he won. They were planning to take money out of his own pension to pay for IVF.

The postman, who raises money for charity by performing in his white sequin suit, insists he has been treated unfairly. Simon said: “I might look a bit rubbish, but I can sing and put on a really good show. “I just want to do something dferent and to be fun. “You see a lot of Elvis tributes who just go through all his tracks but I do something dferent.    “When I saw the quality of some [of the acts that] got in I thought ‘I could have done that’.” Simon, who admits he is probably Britain’s worst Elvis tribute, describes his act as “quite slapstick”. He covers modern songs by artists including Britney Spears in Elvis style,and also dresses as ‘Zombie Elvis’. Simon was hoping to donate the £ prize from last month’s competition in Ipswich, Suffolk, to a hospice in memory of his dad.    But after his application was turned down he decided to raise funds himself, making £ in just three days.

Harry and Meghan stopped by Broom Farm Community Centre to chat with families from the Welsh Guards, Coldstream Guards and Household Cavalry about what army le is really like. The Duchess took the opportunity to share details of Archie’s sleep patterns and teething experience with a few of the mums. Amy Thompson, whose husband Brad is attached to the Welsh Guards, said: “My daughter Aeris is the same age as Archie and we talked about weaning and the children beginning to crawl.is just a normal mum and it was like talking to a friend.”    The majority of the Coldstream Guards are on exercise in Kenya, while a large proportion of the Welsh Guards are coming to the end of a long deployment to The Falklands. The soldiersapos work overseas prompted Prince Harry to admit how in awe he was of the family members at home holding their households together. He said: “It’s unbelievably hard. I have so much respect and admiration for anyone who has to deal with that.”     In the same week that his son Archie turned six months old, family was clearly on the Princeaposs mind. “I can’t imagine what it’s like to miss so much as they change so quickly,” he added. Army spouse Leigh Smith brought along her eight-year-old daughter Molly to meet the Royals.    “Meghan promised not to tell anyone that I was off school,” said Molly. “She asked me who my best friend was.” Molly and her mum have been avid followers of the Duke and Duchess since they held a party to celebrate their wedding on  May last year.     It was an amazing experience for Molly to shake hands with them, Leigh added. It’s really special and a lovely boost for the whole community.” On Thursday morning a video of the Royal couple interacting with young children was posted on their official Instagram page. A caption alongside the video read: Every year during the month of November we pause to remember and honour all those who have served their country here in the UK, across the Commonwealth and around the world.    Their Royal Highnesses also wanted to show support for the families of service personnel who are currently deployed overseas. During the visit yesterday, Their Royal Highnesses met with young families who shared their experiences as parents and as couples who are often apart from their loved ones for months at a time. A reminder that a le of service does not simply describe the person wearing the unorm, but the entire family. Coldstream Guards welfare officer, Capt Colin Lewis, said the visit was a welcome tonic after a tough  months.    “The regiment are really appreciative of the support the families provide by picking up the burden when the service person is away, he explained. It’s great for The Duke and Duchess to take the time to truly understand the challenges they face.

She was greeted with cheers and shouts of God Save the Queen as she arrived at the Royal British Legionaposs Centenary Village in Aylesford to tour the facilities, which support members of the Armed Forces. But many fans were surprised to see she wasnapost wearing a poppy for the visit. She looked beautul in a dark purple coat and hat, which she teamed with a stunning diamond brooch. The Queen simply doesnapost wear her poppy before the Remembrance weekend, and she will have it on when she arrives at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday.She will be joined by Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan Markle , Prince Harry and other members of the Royal Family for the Festival of Remembrance.   On Sunday the same group will attend the Remembrance Sunday service at The Cenotaph. The Queen will watch from the balcony while Charles lays a wreath on her behalf. During her visit to the centre today, the Queen also had a minor run-in with a guide dog, which appeared entirely unfazed as it blocked her path during her visit. Smiling, she quipped: Heaposs bored of this, I think. The Queen took her time speaking to dozens of people, listening to their stories of service for the country all over the world and in numerous dferent conflicts.    The village houses specialist accommodation for armed forces personnel and veterans and their families, as well as those with a disability and the long-term unemployed. The new Appleton Lodge is the latest part of the £ million Centenary Village development which, when complete, will provide homes and welfare support, as well as a community for vulnerable veterans. RBLI, which was formed in  to provide support to sick and wounded soldiers ing from the First World War, launched a campaign in  to build the Centenary Village, which the charity says will see it support hundreds of the most in-need ex-servicemen and women every year for another century. At every turn, the Queen was met with beaming smiles from the hundreds of schoolchildren, veterans, families and staff gathered at the village. Among those eager to meet the royal was Irene Mount, who was born in the same year as the Queen and was one of the first residents to move into the new Appleton Lodge.    The Queen said to her: You have got a nice place here, havenapost you. And they look after you well  Mrs Mount, , sitting next to her son, said she was happy at the lodge. Her husband Reginald Mount had served as Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Navy in the Fleet Air Arm and died  years ago. Turning to Mrs Mount before she left, the Queen said: I am very glad to see you today. After touring the facility, the royal was invited to unveil a plaque to officially open Appleton Lodge, which she did to cheers from the crowd. Elsewhere on the Centenary Village site, the Queen was treated to a tour of Victory House, another set of apartments for veterans. There she met Fijian-born John Ahben, who served with the Kingaposs Own Royal Border Regiment before he was involved in a car accident.    Mr Ahben, who was unconscious for more than two weeks after the incident, stayed at rehabilitation centre Headley Court several times before he joined the RBLI in . He now works as a horticulturist, tending the Cha Garden which he showed to the Queen. The Queen also met members of Britainaposs Bravest Manufacturing Company, an enterprise run by the RBLI which employs veterans and people with disabilities. The factory employs over  people,  of whom are veterans, have a health condition or both.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhenever her husband planned a night out with work friends, Sonia Greensill always found an excuse not to go. Weighing more than  stone, she was too ashamed to meet new people. I didn’t want to be an embarrassment to my husband, or to anyone really, she says. I used to think,they meet me then they’ll know he’s married to a fat woman. I didn’t want to be the one that people saw and thought, oh god, look at the size of her. So I’d find a reason not to go, because then I didn’t have to face it. I missed out on so much because of that, but still it wasn’t enough to stop me eating all the wrong things. I really wish it had been.    Sonia, who has two grown-up children and two grandchildren, was approaching her th birthday and weighing st lb when she decided it was time to change her le. I realised I was at the age where it was now or never, she remembers. I thoughtI didn’t do it then it would be too late. It wasn’t just about being slim, I didn’t want to stand out anymore, I wanted to be unnoticeable. Being so big, I honestly felt abnormal and I just wanted to feel normal. I felt judged all the time, and I couldn’t really argue with it. I was fat and I’d made myself that way so people had every reason to be judgemental, but it was still a horrible feeling.”    When Sonia’s daughter Sharn suggested they go to Slimming World together, she initially refused. “My daughter had put on four stones when she was about , then joined Slimming World and lost it, but put a couple back on so she thought it would be a good ideawe both went,” says Sonia. “But when she first asked me I said ‘I’m not going there, no chance.’ I hadn’t stood on the scales for years, my attitude wasI didn’t know then I didn’t have to think about it. But I started thinking maybe my daughter was worried about me, and should I be worrying about me too ” Sonia’s weigh first started to creep up in her teens – “when everyone was getting a figure, mine just kind of exploded!” she jokes. “I met my husband Colin when I was  and started eating at his house, having curries and things I’d never really eaten at home. It was this new world of food and I couldn’t get enough of it.” Rather than over-eating, Sonia says she ate the wrong types of food.    Butter was my real weakness. I’d lash it on thick white bread toast in the mornings, or on a bacon sandwich, then on a couple of crusty cobs at lunchtime. I just loved it. As the weigh piled on, Sonia found it more and more dficult to indulge her passion for fashion, despite working at Evans plus-size clothes chain at the time. I went up to a size  so I was really limited to what I could wear – everything was stretchy and elasticated or loose-fitting. I absolutely love clothes, but I became a bit mumsy and just faded into the background. It bothered me but I never said it, I just concentrated on being the best mum I could be and I think I dressed my teenage daughter how I would have loved to dressI could.” Sonia, who lives in Cannock, Staffordshire, says she never shared her feelings about her weigh with anyone and her family never mentioned it.  “My husband just loved me for how I was, whatever size I was, and I’m grateful for that but sometimes I wish he’d turned said ‘you could really do with doing something about your size’ even though I don’t know how I’d have reacted. Since I’ve lost weight he’s told me he’d often hear people snigger or make comments, but he didn’t tell me then because he didn’t want to upset me. With walking even short distances starting to become impossible, Sonia, joined her local Slimming World group in February . “I actually didn’t find it that hard to stick to the meal plans because it was basically the same food, but just cooked in a much healthier way,” she says.  “My mindset totally changed. I thought I loved toast with loads of butter so I never gave anything  a chance, but now I love fresh fruit for breakfast and I’d choose it over toast any day. “I’ll have fruit every morning, or grilled bacon with poached egg and mushrooms at weekends, then I’ll make my own soups for lunch in the winter, and have something like Cajun chicken with salad and veg or pasta for dinner. It’s all the food I like so I’m having it because I enjoy it, not because I’ve got to.” As the weight fell off, Sonia joined a gym for the first time – “I thought they were places fit people went, not people who wanted to get fit,” she admits – and she now goes running three times a week. She reached her target weight a year ago and is now down to just st lb – a loss of st lb. And the -year-old is finally able to shop where she wants and go where she wants.

For example, did you know that % of Brits follow bad practices before bed  Caffeine, booze and use of ­electronic devices are the main offenders, according to a new survey by bed manufacturer Sealy. And of the % of UK adults who have used free public Wi-Fi, more than half have entered passwords and used online banking, leaving them at risk of being hacked. But there is good news – tiny mistakes need just tiny changes to put them right. Here we explore how to correct these common errors... Ban the snooze button  It’s certainly tempting to put the alarm on snooze to grab an extra  minutes. “But by dozing off again, we’re preparing our bodies for another sleep cycle, which is then quickly interrupted – causing us to feel fatigued for the rest of the day,” says Holly Housby, sleep expert at Sealy UK. Unplug your charger Electrical appliances kept plugged in when not in use are a major cause of wasted energy. Phone chargers can cost up to £ a year in unused energy. Wait before mouthwash    “Never swill mouthwash straight after brushing – it just removes the protective fluoride from the toothpaste,” warns Dr Mark Buddha, director at MyClinique Dental. Reduce waste Every year Brits throw away  million eggs and  million pints of milk because of our reliance on best-before dates, according to research by Too Good to Go. Dairy brand Arla is now planning to scrap use-by dates on milk, encouraging customers to snf or taste it instead. You can also try the egg test. A fresh egg will sink to the bottom of a bowl of cold water and lie on its side. Eggs nearing expiration – but still fresh enough to eat – will sink and sit upright. Eggs that aren’t fresh will float. Limit your social sharing Less than half of Brits set their social media profiles to private, says online security firm McAfee. The company’s chief scientist Raj Samani says: “And our research discovered that % of people disclose their location when posting online. Be careful what you post and increase privacy settings to ensure tagged posts are only shared with people you know and trust.”  Lead the way Surgeons warn dog owners not to wrap leads around their fingers or wrist because of the dangers of ­laceration, friction burns, fractures and ligament injuries. Avoid public Wi-Fi    Fake Wi-Fi hotspots allow cybercriminals to ­eavesdrop on users and steal usernames, ­passwords and bank details. They often have innocuous sounding names such as “airport wi-fi” and can redirect victims to malicious malware and phishing sites. Genuine public networks ask the user to agree to the terms and ­conditions of accessing the Wi-Fi so an immediate connection could signal an unsafe connection. Always ensure the web address bar reads HTTPS instead of HTTP and check for a padlock. This means that the data is encrypted. Reduce email time A new study of , office workers found they typically spend around two hours each day browsing their inbox – wasting  work days a year. But each time you stop to read or respond to an email it takes between three and  minutes to get your focus back on to what you were previously doing. Turn off notications and batch-check your emails at allocated times.

However, when the former bank worker became faint she was rushed to the emergency room downstairs in the hospital and was given the diagnosis that she had a urinary tract infection. But her instant relief quickly wore off as Jessica was then told she went into septic shock and began fighting for her le hooked up to two dferent IV lines and enduring brain, liver and kidney scans.    After one week in hospital Jessica ed home and back to work before being struck by the same symptoms again just six months laterand was diagnosed with sepsis again, deriving from another UTI. Jessica then quit her job due to her lack of energy and inability to complete apossimpleapos tasks when she was struck with the deadly infection once more in January . However, after saying goodbye to her family and believing there was no recovering this time, Jessica beat the odds and survived sepsis for the third time. Now, she is sharing her story to encourage people to never brush off their symptoms and to ask doctorsit aposcould be sepsisapos when they are receiving diagnosis. Jessica, from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, said: I had taken my mother to the hospital to receive surgery when I suddenly came over very hot - but I thought it was just menopausal hot flashes.    Then I was sick, but still I thought it would just be my nerves because of my motheraposs surgery, so continued to just sit down fanning myself and waiting for her to be seen. Her nurse noticed that I was sweating and looking unwell and told me to go to the emergency room downstairs, but I didnapost listen until I tried to stand up and fell straight back down. When I went downstairs I gave urine samples, had all sorts of scans and was hooked up to IV drips - and after a while I was told I had a UTI, which gave me instant relief. However, just hours later they told me I had gone into septic shock and for the next week I was still in the hospital fighting for my le.    When I was finally allowed home I hoped it was all over so I ed back to work - but then six months later the same symptoms came over me like a wave and, when I got to hospital, I was diagnosed with sepsis again. Once again, I battled through this sepsis before being diagnosed with it again under a year later. This time I said goodbye to my family because I was certain that I couldnapost be lucky a third time, but somehow I was. Every time it was as a result of a UTI - something which is so common in so many women.  Hopefully from sharing my story people will realise it can be so much deeper than your initial diagnosis and Iaposm encouraging people to push their doctors to askit could be sepsis. Despite surviving the le-threatening condition three times, Jessica admits that she suffers from apospost-sepsis syndromeapos still to this day. She said: I have had to quit my job because the side effects of having sepsis three times are just too strong. I am constantly tired, I have constant joint pains, Iaposve lost the feeling in my toes and I canapost solve simple problems or tasks like I used to be able to.

Clashes between police and demonstrators have broken out in Santiago following weeks of unrest over the government’s economic policies, including low salaries and poor healthcare. The violence has seen vandalism, arson attacks and looting in one of Latin America’s richest nations, where there is also anger at the yawning gap between rich and poor. Police have responded by using tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and water cannons against the protesters. Two police officers were engulfed in flames and helped by colleagues who used fire extinguishers and their hands.    The two women, María José Hernández Torres, , and Abigail Catalina Aburto Cardenas, , both members of the Santiago police special forces, are in serious condition in hospital, police said. Chile’s Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel visited the pair in hospital on Monday evening and denounced the attack as “pure violence... nothing to do with the legitimate demands of citizens.” He said: “It was a violent, cowardly aggression against two police officers who were working to protect the safety of our compatriots.”    The two women are among  police officers injured in the demonstrations over the last two weeks, along with , protesters who have been hospitalised, according to human rights groups. Meanwhile, a Chilean prosecutor said today he would seek court approval to investigate  police officers for allegedly torturing protesters during the three weeks of intense unrest and rioting in the country. Manual Guerra, the prosecutor for Santiago East, said the investigation was related to two separate cases during a nine-day state of emergency in the capital Santiago from October .    One related to the actions of  police officers in Nunoa, a bohemian suburb of Santiago, where protestors defied a curfew to conduct successive nights of large but mainly peaceful demonstrations in a central square, a spokesman for Guerra told Reuters without providing further details. The second related to two officers in the lower-middle class area of La Florida who were accused of beating a young man who was handcuffed, the spokesman said. The alleged abuses took place against a backdrop of  days of mass rioting, looting and, more recently, peaceful protests over endemic inequality in one of Latin Americaaposs richest nations.

The announcement comes more than a week after the evil ISIS leader was obliterated and died like a dog during a raid in Syria by U.S. special forces.The hate-filled thug spent his final moments in utter fear, total panic and dread before detonating a suicide vest in a tunnel where he dragged three kids with him. Turkeyaposs President Tayyip Erdogan announced the news earlier today of the weaposs capture, which also comes after other family members of the killer were apprehended.   However, Mr Erdogan appeared to take a swipe at the way the U.S announced Baghdadiaposs death, which was revealed to the world by President Donald Trump during a press conference at the White House. Mr Erdogan said: The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this. But, I am announcing it here for the first time: We captured his we and didnapost make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother in law in Syria.    He gave no further details. A senior Turkish official said that the operation in which Baghdadiaposs we was detained took place on June ,  when Turkish police captured a group of  Islamic State suspects in Turkeyaposs Hatay province. He said one of the four women caught in the operation identied herself as someone  but was in fact Asma Fawzi Muhammad Al-Qubaysi - Baghdadiaposs first we. We discovered her real identity pretty quickly. At that point, she volunteered a lot of information about Baghdadi and the inner workings of ISIS, the official said, adding that the information led to a series of arrests where.  A DNA test confirmed that another suspect was Baghdadiaposs daughter, and the detainees were being held at a deportation centre in Turkey. Earlier this week, a senior Turkish official said Turkey had captured Baghdadiaposs sister, her husband and daughter-in-law. They added that they hoped to gain intelligence from them about Islamic State, although they has not said what knowledge they may have had about the groupaposs operations. Baghdadi rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself caliph of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and Syria from - before Islamic Stateaposs control was wrested away by a U.S.-led coalition.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c878c0ccea290.07156375-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee pupils soaring as statistics show schools now out performing edinburgh","story":"Dundee has leapt from the bottom of the school league table and has now overtaken Edinburgh.The performance statistics, released by the Scottish Government, marks a signicant improvement from the previous year when it was revealed the city was the worst-performing area in the country.The  data showed just one in eight secondary schools in the city, St John’s RC High School, achieved results above expectations while six under performed.It also showed two city secondary schools, Baldragon and Braeview academies, were among the  worst performing state school in Scotland – achieving results % lower than expected.But this year’s data, which was originally published by The Times, shows the best performing school in Dundee was Grove Academy, with % of its pupils attaining five Highers or more.Harris Academy came in second, with % achieving five Highers or more, followed by St John’s with % of pupils getting the haul of qualications.One of last year’s worst performing schools, Braeview Academy, experienced an increase in the number of pupils achieving five or more Highers, rising from % to %.However, Baldragon Academy experienced a slight decrease, with levels falling from % in  to % this year.Education convener Stewart Hunter said he was “pleased” with the improvements while recognising there was still more work to be done.He added: “A signicant effort has been made in the last year to improve year-on-year.“Last year’s figures weren’t good despite overall performance in schools over the last  years.

Countless tangerine Keffiyehshave been donned by United supporters off to cup finals and many a t-shirt or badge announces the wearer is: “proud to be an Arab”.I produced a book earlier this year, Arabs Away, and since then have been asked several times, “So why are Dundee United supporters called Arabs ” Embarrassingly, I didn’t know for sure.The usual answer is that in the bitter winter of -, long before undersoil heating came to Tannadice, United went several weeks without a home game. Things were getting desperate, fixtures were piling up and, more importantly, the coffers were running low.So Jerry Kerr and the board moved heaven, earth, and several fierce-looking pieces of machinery, to thaw out the pitch to try to get the Scottish Cup tie against Albion Rovers, scheduled for January , , declared “on”.William Briggs  Sons, roadmakers at the Camperdown Refinery down at Dundee docks, brought in a tar-burner to melt the Tannadice tundra. It worked. Or, at least, it sort of worked. The ice sheet melted away like a DFC defence at the feet of Luggy and Ralphie, but all the grass was burned off too!However, several lorryloads of sand was spread over the pitch and Glasgow referee Donald Weir was inveigled to declare “game on”.United performed well that day – Doug Smith, Dennis Gillespie, Wattie Carlyle  Co rattled in three for no reply. This led some newspapers to declare the lads in whitehad taken to the sand “like Arabs”. And the name stuck. And that’s why the supporters are called Arabs.It’s a great story, but isn’t remotely true.United did melt the ice to get that game on but I’ve searched newspaper databases, microfiche pages, several dusty archives, and spoken to people who were in the newspaper business at the time and there is no mention of United being called “Arabs” in any newspaper that year, or for several years afterwards. And anyway, it is the fans who are known as Arabs, not the team.More investigation was required. My quest led me to Graham McLaren, owner of specialist sports retailers Clubsport in Dundee. He’s a United supporter of long standing and known to most as “Spider”. vw, px\"  But before we get to Spider’s story, a short history lesson:Gamal Abdel Nasser was the de facto leader of the Arab world, from his election as president of Egypt in  and throughout the s. He was a giant of Middle Eastern politics. He defied the West during the Suez Crisis and became the figurehead of pan-Arabism, the push to unite all Arab nations. He inspired devotion from his followers and fear in European capitals in equal measure.An inspirational speechmaker, to this day he is regarded, by some, as an icon, a strong man who brought decisive leadership to a troubled region.We shall let Spider take up the story of the sequence of events that led his name to affect the city of Dundee.Spider told me: “My first season as a United supporter was  , our second season ‘up’.“My first game was v Partick Thistle at Tannadice. We won -. It was January , , and I’d not long turned . I’d gone along on my own and stood on the north terracing. Two days later, after school, I walked down to David Low sports shop in Reform Street and purchased a rattle and a black and white scarf.“I still have the rattle, I painted it black and white. It cost  , .p in today’s money.“On the Monday I’d recalled Saturday’s experience to school chums in my own year and a year or two above. I learned that some of them were in the habit of assembling for home games behind the goal at the Amalfi End, the East or Eddie Thompson Stand at today’s Tannadice.“That was it. I was to join them there at every home game for the rest of the season and way beyond.“We’d go in early, half an hour before kick-off. There was a cheerleader in our midst, a thinnish, middle-aged man wearing a long overcoat and a bunnet. Nothing unusual in that, half the men in the crowd were similarly attired. We’d shout our hearts out, our leader urging us through the repertoire. This was how it was at Tannadice at every home game.“He was always there. I can see him yet, stood in the middle of a couple of hundred choirboys he’d conduct us. ‘HELLO!’ he’d yell repeatedly, to which we would simply echo, ‘HELLO!’ That would be the warm up to get our vocal chords going.“Then, stepping up a gear, a rhyme, ‘T-E-R-R-O-R-S, are we the Terrors  ‘YES, YES, YES’, we echoed. There was plenty of singing too. ‘There’s not a team like the Dundee United’ and ‘Hail, hail, United’s here’ were two stock songs.“At one particular game our cheerleader was full of it. I’ll never remember what game it was but he had a new line, a new cheer. He was on to something. After the warm-up he was heard to bellow – ‘I AM NASSER AND YOU ARE MY ARABS!’“The Amalfi End cheerleader bore a striking resemblance to President Nasser. The same dark, receding hair line and, crucially, the pencil moustache and dusky complexion.“So Nasser he became.

I remember there used to be this -seater red bus that Drew Jarvie would drive to take us out to the barracks for training.“In the winter you’d be getting on and off the bus in the snow and having to build the goals and things like that.“We’ll still get rain and snow at Westhill, but at least we won’t have to build the goals.”Considine also believes having the training facilities at Kingsford will give Derek McInnes’ first team more time to hone their skills.Currently, time constraints can be a factor in how much additional work can be done after training.McInnes has spoken previously about training at places like Aberdeen Sports Village and Spain Park, where they are only able to hire pitches for a set period of time.Now that the training ground has been completed, the Dons won’t have that problem.And Considine says it’s little things like this that make a big dference.He added: “I understand the dference it can make – you can do extra work before and after training.“Don’t get me wrong, right now Tony Docherty will take strikers to do a bit and boys will do stuff themselves at the end of training.“But then you’re on a bus for  or  minutes, back to the stadium.“It’s the same before – you do your prehab to warm up and then you go on a bus and you’re stf again and have to do a bit more when you get to training.“That might not seem like much, but it’s the little things that make a dference.“These facilities will all help, which will be fantastic.”Considine believes proper training facilities are something Aberdeen have needed for a long time.Having a training ground and also a new stadium is something that has been mooted for many years.But to finally see it delivered is something that Considine and all his colleagues are thrilled about.The first-team squad trained at Kingsford for the first time last Friday, before Saturday’s - Pittodrie victory against Kilmarnock.He said: “The players are all looking forward to it.“I’ve been here  or  years and it’s been a long time coming. But I’m absolutely delighted to get into the new facility.“It’s what the club have been needing for a very long time.“It won’t just be great for the first team, it will be great for all the youth teams as well to have the facility.“If you have everyone together it makes it feel like even more of a family club.“Having this gives everyone from youth teams to first team the opportunity to do more training and practise more.“Everything will become easier for us.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/5dbfb5b6a79f02.08642347-821x564.jpg ","title":"gift of an

opened its doors at the weekend.Thousands streamed through the doors of the gallery on Saturday and yesterday to get their first glimpse inside the building since it closed to the public in .Free tickets for the opening days were quickly snapped up when they were released in September, with more than , members of the public booking places for the opening two days.The council’s culture spokeswoman Marie Boulton said: “It’s not the council’s gallery, it’s everyone’s gallery.“I think people will come in and get that familiar hug of things they will recognise, from the granite pillars to the Cowdray Hall to the Memorial Hall.“Then they’ll look up and they’ll get this amazing sense of excitement that will run through them when they see the floor we have added, the beautul features that are around and the amazing collections now being exhibited.“I’m so proud and privileged to be able to hand this gallery back fit for the next generation of art-goers.” vw, px\"  She said it was hoped to transform the type of visitors the gallery attracts.Ms Boulton said: “It’s there for people who appreciate art at a very high level but there’s lots of things here for children, from drawing pads to interactive things, to those who just want to browse, including the lovely coffee shop.“There is something for everyone and I just hope the people of Aberdeen feel we have done justice not just to the building but absolutely celebrate all the new additions as well.”The £. million redevelopment involved the restoration and modernisation of the grade A-listed building with a new second level to increase the number of spaces for displays. vw, px\"  The “striking” top floor will house the BP Galleries, which will host three national and international touring exhibitions each year.Visitors flocked to the historic venue, with crowds gathering ahead of the doors opening on Saturday, where they were greeted to the sounds of a piper as they made their way inside the revamped space.The ribbon to the venue was officially cut by Ms Boulton and Christine Rew, art gallery and museums manager, before the first members of the gallery made their way inside.Young and old could be seen enjoying the exhibits throughout the day.Many pointed to the venue feeling more spacious and easier to get around, while others said they were pleased to see familiar favourites back up on the walls.Ms Rew, who has helped show groups around the venue during preview events all week, said it was “absolutely fantastic” to welcome the public back inside the building.She said: “The initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive throughout the ious preview activities we’ve had over this week.“Even half an hour into opening, I could hear people say how amazing it

five users of a popular Aberdeen walking route feels unsafe on the path, a new survey has revealed.The questionnaire was organised by Cults, Bieldside and Milltimber Community Council after residents voiced their concerns about the Old Deeside Railway line.It was organised as part of a safety event which saw path users being handed flyers to promote safe behaviour and tolerance towards other users.Among the organisations consulted were the City Ranger Service, Police Scotland, Nestrans, Grampian Cycle Partnership, Culter Community Council and the British Horse Society.The survey found that, as well as one in five regular users feeling unsafe at times, the least confident users are recreational walkers and dog walkers, with one in four not feeling generally safe.Commuting cyclists and runners were found to be most confident on the path.Among the concerns raised were that of cyclists going too fast and not always using a bell and dog walkers failing to control their dogs.The report suggested there should be signs to promote awareness and tolerance of other users.It added: “Signs could, to some extent, affect the rural style of the path but that may have to be accepted as a pay-off to maintaining safety and facing the increasing usage of the facility, a trend that is being encouraged by Aberdeen City’s Active Travel drive.”There were also concerns raised about lighting, which could only be installed along major stretches of the patha major sponsor could be found.Councillor Philip Bell, who represents Lower Deeside, said: “The Deeside Railway line is a key path which is used by many people.“Unfortunately people don’t always have consideration for others as highlighted by the survey.“Cyclists are using Strava to race each other along the path and not being respectful to others.”He added: “Other than putting up more signage, it is down to the invididuals to change their behaviour.”Guus Glass, from Cults Bieldside and Milltimber Community Council, said: “We are taking action to increase safety at the line. It is not a road in the eyes of the Highway Code so it’s dficult to enforce rules or regulations.“However, we are looking to improve the signage around the area, hopefully in time for next summer when the path is busiest.He added: “We need to issue more clear advice to users about what is acceptable behaviour.”The full report can be viewed on the Cults, Bieldside and Milltimber community website at cbmcommunity.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 20 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsArgyll and Bute Council has a duty of care to pupils to ensure their health, and their safety, during the school day.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre.

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

With Mondays five matches delivering only one win it was a rather downbeat team who gathered for the team meeting that night.Stuart #The Forest# Johnston couldn#t see the wood for the trees, The Sneddon couldn#t see the goal for the hanky protecting his head from the sun, Iain #Caravan# MacDonald was thinking too much about camper vans, whilst Tom #The Gin# Kilcolm didn#t live up to his name and went nearly tea total.Captain Anderson though delivered when it mattered. With Colin #The Cat# in goal, Sneddon was deployed at the back alongside. MacDonald, Johnston and Kilcolm were pushed further forward with the captain and #The Scribe# Litster in midfield. As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain.

A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site.

roundabout on the busy road.However, it was eventually decided that a bear, designed by renowned Scottish artist Andy Scott, would be created on land near the townrsquos Asda store and McDonaldrsquos restaurant, east of the roundabout.The sculpture will stand on top of a mound of earth.Ken Ross, from Hallhill Development Ltd, which is behind the proposals, told the Courier work was under way, with

Aberdeenrsquos Marischal Square.Work was delayed slightly to allow the re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar to take place last month.The sculpture, which is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, is a nod towards John Muir, who was born in the town before emigrating to the USA and playing a key role in the formation of the countryrsquos national park system.Planning permission for the sculpture was originally turned down by East Lothian Council after concerns were raised that the work of art would be a distraction to drivers on the A.The decision

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh. However, at this time we have not been invited to join any group."},{"url":null,"title":"80-year-old-port-seton-pensioner-admits-breaching-asbo","story":"Thomas Hamilton, , broke the rules of the ASBO imposed in April which had barred him from using aggressive, abusive or intimidating language or causing distress to neighbours at his Long Craigs home.He breached the order on August  when he was found to have used abusive language during an incident where he obstructed a parking bay during an argument with a neighbour.Hamilton also damaged a vehicle during the row near to his home.The OAP also assaulted neighbour Ian Hirst by struggling with him during a separate incident at Long Craigs on August .The pensioner was back in the dock at Edinburgh Sherf Court last Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to the two offences.Sherf John Cook was told that Hamilton had a review of a previous case with another sherf in March next year and he was content to defer all matters to that date.No narration of the August events were read out in court and all matters were deferred to March .Hamilton admitted breaching his ASBO on August .

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

Malign forces are gathering in Mordor, in the shape of American pharmaceutical companies, waiting for their Dark Lord Trump to gobble up the NHS and force costly medicines down our throats.The Labour leader then came out with a claim that Brexit would cost the NHS pound million extra per week in higher medicine costs. This was remarkable for being even dafter than the poundm on the side of Boris Johnsonsrsquos Big Red Bus.:If Labour win, itll be less like Venezuela than Britain circa It is based on a remark ndash subsequently retracted by Donald Trump ndash that ldquoeverything would be on the table in trade talks with the UK. The POTUS was talking even more nonsense than usual because there really is no prospect of a public service like the NHS being anywhere near the table in trade talks. And thatrsquos not me talking, but the Nuffield Trust, the leading NHS think tank.Nor is there a serious risk of American pharmaceutical companies forcing up the cost of medicines through open competition, as Mr Corbyn claims. The reason, according to the Nuffield, is because competitive tendering for drug prices has been going on for decades, and the NHS does very well out of it. As the biggest health-care purchaser on the planet, it gets the best prices from Big Pharma.The purpose of all this was to ert attention from Labourrsquos actual policy on Brexit, which is not to have any policy at all. ldquoWe recognise why people voted Leave we recognise why people voted Remain, said Labourrsquos Employment spokeswoman, Laura Pidcock, yesterday. ldquoWe are not the party of either: we are the party of both.Therersquos a philosophical debate to be had on whether it is possible to be both for and against Brexit.

And after negotiating this spanking new deal Mr Starmer says he would then campaign against it. Those of us with long memories recall Labourrsquos ldquolongest suicide note of . This is the shortest.Labourrsquos confusion over Brexit rather disguises the fact that the Tories are also split. Mr Johnson surprised MPs by delivering a new Brexit deal, with the Irish backstop moved to the Irish Sea. But the UK would still remain under Brussels rule during the transition period and could still find itself beholden the ECJ in the subsequent trade deal.He has gone the long way round Brexit and found himself back where he started. Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party are not going to let him forget that  per cent of the new Brexit deal is actually the old Theresa May Brexit Deal.Tory hard-liners agree, but they are keeping quiet because they realise that,they donrsquot back Mr Johnsonrsquos Brexit, they probably wonrsquot get any Brexit at all. Their hopes are pinned now on forcing a World Trade Organisation trade deal after the transition period and delivering hard Brexit by stealth.As for the voters, I suspect many of them just want to see the whole Brexit madness stopped. Which to be fair is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing: to revoke Article . But there is one slight problem with this: the UK voted to leave the EU.It might very well do so again in a repeat referendum. But the Liberal Democrat ldquoPM-in-waiting, Jo Swinson, says shersquod just ignore that. Itrsquos like the head girl telling everyone that they canrsquot have fizzy drinks. She knows whatrsquos good for us.As for the SNP, well it wants a referendum on Brexit too, though itrsquos not entirely clear whether it would consider the result binding. After all, it is calling for a new referendum on Scottish independence to keep us in the EU.But has the SNP thought this through  By agreeing a confirmatory vote on the new Brexit deal, does that not also mean agreeing, in principle, to a confirmatory vote on any deal after indyref Nicola Sturgeon insists that the two are ldquoof course completely dferent. But unless she wants to crash out of the UK, therersquoll have to be a deal with London. No one can know the nature of that deal ndash on currency, debt, borders, customs and regulatory alignment ndash until after it has been negotiated.So, the SNP position begins to looklike not one, but three referendums.

The first four of these have now been delivered with suitable EV charging points also being installed.Electric it seems is winning the battle to be the alternative fuel source of choice going forward, but as a responsible operator, we have a clear duty to explore all possible options and to take the necessary steps to future proofing our business.For more information please visitwww.firstgroup"},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-scottish-tories-fought-hard-get-scotlands-voice-heard","story":"Mr Mundell, who was Scottish secretary under Theresa May and David Cameron, argued Scottish Tory MPs ldquohave fought hard in Whitehall to get Scotlandrsquos voice heard.Ahead of a campaign visit to Peebles alongside the partyrsquos acting Scottish leader Jackson Carlaw, Mr Mundell highlighted UK Government action to freeze whisky taxes, exempt Police Scotland from VAT and introduce tax relief for the oil and gas sector as victories for Scottish Conservative MPs during the last parliament.:David Mundell: Independence majority at Holyrood in  should spark referendumThe former minister said voters face a choice between SNP ision or ldquomore delivery of peoplersquos priorities with the Tories.Thanks to @Jackson_Carlaw for joining the team in a chilly Peebles this morning.

At the time of its discovery during the  season it was found to contain a human jawbone and two neonatal lambs.ldquoThe vessel had been placed just outside the broch wall, very close to the entrance, when the broch was put out of use around the mid-Second Century AD. As well as the whalebone vessel and jawbone, two red deer antlers had been propped against the vessel and a very large saddle quern, a grinding stone, had been positioned against the vessel to pin it firmly in place against the broch wall. All this treatment appears to have been part of the measures employed to perform an act of closure of the broch.There are several more fin whale items from the site so it should be possible to identy relationships between animals and also match bones across the area to the same animal.Beyond the vessel, there is also a particular concentration of bone in the broch and scientists say it will be interesting to see what this research can reveal about the use of whalebone in this monumental Iron Age structure.Fin whales are also among the fastest whales in the sea, capable of bursts of km h when hunting, or threatened, and they can e fast and very deeply.Indeed, in the modern era, the fin whale was only really hunted in large numbers once the explosive harpoon was invented and so it is unlikely to have been pursued in the Iron Age.That does not mean other types of whale were not hunted, and the question of whether some whales were pro-actively sourced during the Iron Age remains unanswered. In time, further study of patterns of whalebone and species recognition from sites like The Cairns may shed light on this."},{"url":null,"title":"world-first-electric-gritter-set-forth-crossings","story":"But now anelectric gritting vehicle, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the world, will help with efforts to keep Scotlandrsquos roads clear of snow while dramatically reducing carbon emissions.Transport Scotland bosses announced the state-of-the-art  per cent electric spreading vehicle will be trialled over the coming months.The Electra vehicle, which is part of a fleet of  gritters based at more than depots across the country, will undertake patrols on the Queensferry Crossing and the Forth Road Bridge, which is still used by buses.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the move is part of efforts to make the fleet of winter response vehicles ldquomore environmentally friendly.New weather stations and sensors on the M ndash the main road linking Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash are also to be trialled, as is a new form of road treatment using reduced amounts of salt, which will be initially used on the A.Meanwhile, transport chiefs said they would continue to lease specialist vehicles to deal with the most extreme winter conditions.After heavy snowfall in previous years resulted in major disruption to traffic, new route-specic snow plans have been drawn up for key roads across the country including the M, M, Mand M.Transport chiefs have almost , tonnes of salt in storage, more than was used in the whole of last winter.Mr Matheson said: ldquoOur teams have worked hard throughout the year to ensure we are ready when dficult winter conditions set in.

In fact, with the SNP in power since , it could be argued that supporting independence is the status quo position. If some polls are accurate support for independence now stands at  per cent. Opposing independence could soon be the minority view.Yet as support for independence grows ndash as it becomes the mainstream, and the sense of historic inevitability increases ndash therersquos also a feeling that the concept of Scottish independence is stagnating, that it needs reimagined.This election focuses that tension: as support for independence appears to near critical mass, the concept begins to look very tired. The debate about independence in this election will be relatively meaningless.:New poll published on Scottish independenceWe already know what will happen. Labour, Tories and the LibDems will say itrsquos bad, the SNP and the Greens will say itrsquos good. Therersquoll be no nuance. Therersquoll be no substantive debate. Therersquoll be no new thoughts about independence, about its shape and form, about what happens after a vote supporting independence. Itrsquoll be a constitutional pantomime.Independence will even overshadow Brexit. As an issue, Brexit still retains some nuance, making debate worthwhile. The same canrsquot be said of independence. Voters may be tired but they will listen to what the parties say about Europe because there may still be something to learn, something new to inform our thinking.But with independence, our minds are made up, and so are the politiciansrsquo minds. We know the story. Itrsquos a redundant debate. Yet, ironically independence is the debate which will dominate. The real issues which matter ndash jobs, climate, housing, health, policing, taxes, schools ndash theyrsquoll all get an airing, but we know theyrsquoll come second. This is an election which politicians, especially the SNP, know rests on the constitution.Herersquos the crucial problem for the independence debate: the only vision we have of independence is a nationalist one. Independence is seen by nearly all voters as an SNP issue ndash you donrsquot like the SNP, you donrsquot like independence. Of course, the Greens support independence, but despite an environmental message of hope, they find it almost impossible to breakthrough and get their voices heard.:Scottish Politician of the Year : Nominations revealed for national award ceremonyAfter the  referendum, voters split along constitutional lines. Most newly forged Yes voters left their old political homes, like Labour and the LibDems, for the SNP. No voters primarily kept to their traditional parties and dug in to repel the nationalists.This meant independence became the sole territory of the SNP. By the time the referendum was over,  per cent of the people supported independence - yet it was the domain of one party. Thatrsquos a democratic mess, and itrsquos led to intellectual stagnation and political entropy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"description\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media szeKVABJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests szeKVABJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Independence is too big an issue for the SNP alone. I speak as a Yes voter. The party hierarchy project a vision of independence which is cautious, managerial, and, frankly, uninspiring. The vision of independence projected by the SNPrsquos base is one wrapped in a saltire it feels blinkered, insular and smacks of old-style nationalism.The bottom line is that in Scotland a nationalist ideology thoroughly dominates the concept of independence. But as the  referendum showed, support for independence grew not among people who identied as nationalist, but among people who identied as progressive and internationalist, who wanted an outward-looking Scotland rather than a regressive Westminster.:Alister Jack: evenSNP wins most Scottish seats in election Nicola Sturgeon wont have mandate for indyrefThere are plenty of people who support independence but hate nationalism ndash Irsquom one. I know a lot of No voters ndash Labour, LibDem, and even Tory ndash who say now that they see independence as a viable choice. They no longer view it as something hostile. However, theyrsquoll never vote for it because of their deep antipathy towards the SNP.What would change the entire dynamic of the debate is this:the traditional unionist parties dropped their outright opposition to independence, took a neutral position, and allowed their members to think and vote freely on the issue. That way wersquod get some robust and imaginative thinking.Of course, I accept itrsquos probably a pipe-dream, but I also said this country needs to use its imagination to make politics better. Wersquore a brainy nation, not scared of big ideas ndash so dare to imagine.Imaginewe were given a socialist vision of independence by unshackled Labour politicians. That would certainly appeal to centre-left folk like me. Imagine how fascinating it would be to hear a radical Tory voice envision a capitalist form of independence. This type of change to the tempo of discussion would also allow the Green message ndash an environmental vision of independence ndash to break through, when itrsquos most needed. Most importantly, such an approach would detoxy debate, erode isions, and sow the seeds of unity.All this would pose a serious threat to the SNPrsquos stranglehold on power. Voters who arenrsquot drawn to the SNP, but do support independence, would find dferent candidates to back who they agree with on both the constitution and bread and butter issues.In the current Brexit mess, itrsquos hard for an independence supporter, whorsquos uncomfortable with the SNP, to find alternative candidates to vote for, especiallythey feel a Green vote is wasted. This isnrsquot healthy for democracy. Nor is it healthy for the SNP. The party is sluggish and complacent ndash it needs some fire at its heels.Itrsquos bewildering why all of the other parties fail to see any benefit in taking a neutral position on independence. Labour must realise the days of Gordon Brown are over. The party has taken such slippery positions on Brexit that it can surely find a slippery way to become neutral over independence.The LibDems defy the notion of liberal democracy in their dictatorial refusal to countenance a second indyref.And the Tories  Well, it seems crazy to think of the Tories being neutral on independence, but not so long ago the party was the bulwark of the union hellip until it threw Ulster unionism under the bus over Brexit. After all, the Conservatives would sell their granny for anything which gave them a soupccedilon more power.The simple fact is that a country on the cusp of great change ndash of possibly soon going it alone in the world as a new nation ndash needs vision for the future, and right now thatrsquos in pretty short supply.

However, I was swt to point out there were no fewer than five workplace romances on the go, most of them related to our overlords at STV, involving bosses and subordinate females.My point however was not just to indicate hypocrisy, but to outline that office flings are there to be flung. And I added,the work is getting done, then what  matters Therersquos also a wider picture to be considered with workplace romances. Why should the terminally shy be punished because they canrsquot chat freely to people they donrsquot know in a bar  Why should someone with a couple of kids who canrsquot get out at the weekend be victimised by company policy  Itrsquos all very well for actor Emma Watson this week to declare shersquos happy to beldquoself-partnering but what of the austerity-raddled who canrsquot afford to dress up and hit the town And wouldnrsquot the imposition of romance be an indicator of borderline totalitarianism  To deny the chemistry a couple has is at least immoral.Yes, of course, work place rules should be adhered to no kissy kissy in the staff canteen, no allowing domestic fights to follow you into the office. But remember too the #MeToo movement has already made men fearful of offering a scant smile in the direction of an employee for fear of reprisal.When WS Gilbert wrote ldquoItrsquos love that makes the world go round for Iolanthe he didnrsquot add ldquoBut keep it out of the office.

In one paper, the authors calculated the risk of death in almost four million people followed up for around ten years. Dog owners were  per cent less likely to die during that period than those who did not have one. The survival benefit was even greater in those people who had a history of a previous heart attack. The dog owners in this group had a  per cent reduction in risk of death compared to non-owners with previous heart attacks.It might be assumed that the benefit of having a dog was caused by the exercise people get from taking them for a walk. However, people might be sceptical that this could confer such health benefits. Surely a stroll with a pet is not nearly energetic enough  Surely, there must be other influences at work : Study finds owning a dog linked to better heart health: How to fix the NHS and Scotland’s health – Catherine CalderwoodFurthermore, associations between events do not prove that one event is the cause of the other and there may be many other explanations for the improved survival. For example, there is strong evidence that people who have strong social networks are less likely to die prematurely. The companionship and affection between dog and owner might make a positive contribution to wellbeing.A real effect on survivalHowever, a second paper, using data from Sweden, was able to take some account of issues like social and family networks and it, too, showed dog ownership to be associated with reduced risk of death after a heart attack or stroke. Dog ownership meant that those who lived alone and who had a heart attack were  per cent less likely to die than heart attack patients who did not own dogs. Dog owners were also  per cent less likely to die following a stroke. Reduced risks were also seen in dog owners who lived with their families. Dog ownership seems to have a real effect on survival.It seems that dog walking has greater health benefits than expected. But, can it really be true that exercise as mild as walking a dog prolongs your le  Current guidance in the UK suggests that, in order to get health benefits, adults should aim for at least  minutes of vigorous activity a week or  minutes of moderate activity. However, a third paper published a few weeks ago suggested that the risk of early death could be reduced with lower levels of exercise. A group of researchers from several dferent countries pooled the results of  studies which looked at the impact of running on mortality in around , people followed up for between five and  years. They found that those who went running had a  per cent lower risk of death during follow-up. Deaths from heart attacks were reduced by  per cent and deaths from cancer were  per cent lower in those doing some running. The important conclusion the authors came to was that more was not necessarily better. There was no statistical link between the frequency, duration or pace of running and the survival benefit. Any running, even once a week, they concluded, was better than no running and higher doses did not necessarily produce greater reductions in mortality. These studies seem to show that the benefits of being active start at low levels of activity. Any exercise is better than none.

They replied with a single, red-faced angry emoji.Two months ago, polls suggested the Scottish Tories would be all but wiped out in a snap general election. With the SNP riding high, and the Lib Dems also touting themselves as the only pro-EU, pro-Union force in Remain-voting Scotland, things looked bleak for most of the -strong Scottish Tory contingent.But now, with Boris Johnson visiting Moray on the first campaign swing of the election today, the mood is much more optimistic. What has changed : General Election Briefing: Blow for Corbyn as deputy quits The Scottish Tories were hailed as the heroes of the  general election. Theresa May would not have held onto power without them. But in the weeks that followed Boris Johnson’s entry into Downing Street, it appeared they had been sidelined.His “do or die” pledge to leave the EU evenit meant a no-deal Brexit, his controversial prorogation of parliament, and his brutal sacking of Scottish Secretary David Mundell made many Scottish Tories privately uneasy, eventhey kept faith in public.The shock resignation of Ruth Davidson robbed them of a distinctive standard bearer and gave the party no choice but to fall in line behind the Prime Minister.But while the country is going to the polls without a fully-ratied Brexit deal, the fact that the Prime Minister was able to get an agreement through the Commons has reassured Tory MPs about the spectre of no-deal.: Opinion: Why excluding SNP from debates is wrong Polls in Scotland have stabilised, with the Tories staying above % and ahead of Labour. Speaking to on Borders MP, they were also confident of being able to soak up much of the Brexit Party vote that won the party an MEP in the European election.With so many options in Scotland, tactical voting will also be key. Lib Dem voters in Aberdeenshire and Labour voters in East Renfrewshire will be constantly reminded that they risk having an SNP MPthey don’t back the best Unionist prospect.Nicola Sturgeon is an electoral asset, Scots Tories claim, in a bleak December election where turnout could be low. \"If I knock on a door on election day and find a family with their feet up around the Christmas tree, mentioning her name will get them to the polls,\" one said.“It isn’t going to be the wipeout that many predict,” another claimed. Indeed, the party is talking up its chances in places like Lanark and Hamilton East, where the Tories came a close second, and East Lothian, where they came third.Scottish Tory losses are pencilled in for election night on  December - but with every seat counting on the tough road to a majority for Boris Johnson, the fact he’s hit the campaign trail in Scotland early on should be no surprise.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon pays tribute to brave work of martin mcguinness","story":"Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland after he died aged .The First Minister released a statement on Tuesday saying that without Martin McGuinness’ “hard and brave work to bridge the ide” that “peace would not have been achieved” in Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon said she got to know Mr McGuinness recently through their work in the British Irish Council and the Joint Ministerial Committee.“Martin will be remembered for his commitment, alongside that of Ian Paisley, to bringing peace and reconciliation to Northern Ireland,” Ms Sturgeon said.:Martin McGuinness, ex-Northern Ireland deputy FM, dies at “He grew up in Northern Ireland’s troubled past - but without his hard and brave work to bridge the ide, peace would not have been achieved.“I had the opportunity in recent years to get to know Martin through our work in the British Irish Council and Joint Ministerial Committee - his deep understanding of both the importance and fragility of the peace process, and also his optimism for the future, was obvious to all.“While he had been unwell for a few months, his untimely death will still come as a shock to many and my thoughts and sympathies are with his we, wider family and friends.”More to follow.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Music, the sound psychology of emotion and feeling##.what can be stronger Bobis Johnson is music to the country#s ears.David,you areabsolutely correct. To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief. Was it #Arty subjects# you taught perchance  It is#bizarre and idiotic# to use battery cars when your power source is diesel generated. You actually increase your carbon footprint! Simples. Now ask any well-educated youngster and they will explain the science to you.#Simples# Well that is a scientic proof Popper would have been proud of!I think the personal attacks on Peter and his educationonly make your point stronger.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#.

It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#.

Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine.

He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far.

There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquoInteresting, with fuel poverty so high on the agenda Gary Robinson wants to declare a #climate emergency# causing the SIC to spend scarce money on #tackling climate change#. However, the UK government has already set its #net zero # target into law, as recommended in the IPCC#s  Special Report. The Scottish government has gone even further with #net zero #. This will cost UK energy consumers over £ trillion# enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years! # causing fuel poverty to continue to soar.SIC will be allocated compulsory government targets, to achieve the above aims. Any SIC action beyond that would be superfluous and not scientically justied i.e. motivatedby virtue-signalling. SIC should spend any spare resources on alleviating fuel poverty, already % of Shetland homes, and set to expand dramatically with the above targets.I#m surprised Mr Robinson, chairman of NHS Shetland, shows such cavalier disregard for those infuel poverty when over , people died of coldin the much milder climate of England and Wales, in  .The fuel poverty buck stops there, people die unnecessarily.The #excess winter deaths I referred to are shocking and were due to people#s inability to heat their homes adequately. These are people infuel poverty.Were , people to die during a summer heat wave, the #climate emergency# fraternity would become apoplectic and there would be a frenzy of closing down every means of using fossil fuel. But winter deaths are nothing new and these people are poor, so perhaps, they don#t count .As explained above, #climate emergency# does not come from the IPCC. It is a fad of the well-off, the bourgeoisie, who care nought for the fate of the poor but wish solely to use it as a ruse to win middle class votes using alarmist rhetoric.The Shetland Partnership has a specic objective of reducing fuel poverty by a third, by  # how is that progressing And a further aim of halving it by   Aye!The SIC and NHS Shetland are key members of the Shetland Partnership and councillors need to focus on fuel poverty as, not only will this aim not be achieved, the situation will become much worse, as a result of current government climate policy..."},{"url":null,"title":"americana artist returns for double header ","story":"One of Scotland’s finest exponents of Americana music is ing to the islands for two intimate shows this week.Glasgow-based singer-songwriter Daniel Meade will be accompanied by guitarist Lloyd Reid for concerts at The String in Lerwick on Thursday and Friday night, supported by Adam Guest and Sheila Henderson respectively., last year. was single of the week on BBC Radio Scotland.#We have worked up a large repertoire of material over the years that we dip into depending on the occasion and audience#, said Meade.#Upbeat, downbeat and everywhere in between, these shows will be mainly leaning on material from the three most recent albums we’ve released.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services alerted after cliff incident ","story":"A woman has been rescued from clfs in the South Mainland after getting into dficulty on Wednesday afternoon.Coastguard teams had been alerted and the rescue helicopter scrambled after the woman became stranded near Exnaboe.Shetland Coastguard said the woman was taken from the clf by a hi-line transfer, which allowed her to be taken safely into the helicopter.The Lerwick Leboat was providing cover off-shore.Ambulance personnel and coastguard representatives are manning the emergency landing site in Lerwick, where the casualty was taken before being transferred to the Gilbert Bain Hospital..."},{"url":null,"title":"voting underway in two council by elections ","story":"Voting got underway in two council by-elections on Thursday to establish who will take the Lerwick South and Shetland Central seats.A total of five polling stations were opened – in Burra, Tingwall and Scalloway for the Shetland Central poll, and in Gulberwick Hall and Gilbertson Park for Lerwick South.The doors opened at am on Thursday morning, with voting due to run until pm.Voters were being asked to list their preferred candidates from one to five, and are free to rank as many – or as few – as they like.Votes will be counted in the town hall on Friday, with a declaration expected no later than am.Papers will be counted electronically – the same method used in the  council elections.It follows a Lerwick South hustings debate on Saturday, in which poverty and climate change dominated discussions.The candidates in Shetland Central are: Julie Buchan , Johan Adamson , Stewart Douglas , Moraig Lyalland Gordon Laverie .Those standing in Lerwick South are: Gary Robinson , Frances Valente , Arwed Wenger , Caroline Hendersonand Stephen Flaws . raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STORR-AERIAL-VIEW-1.jpg","title":"editorial we cannot and should not expect skyes tourist industry to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLast week Mark Crothall, the chief executive of the independent industry body the Scottish Tourism Alliance, denied that Scotland as a whole suffered from #overtourism#.Instead, argued Mr Crothall, the country has a couple of #pressure points# which in their season attract a lot of people and a lot of publicity.The most prominent of Mark Crothall#s pressure points are — you guessed it — Edinburgh and the island of Skye.In a sense the question is academic. If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191028_101405.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

Our smallest hawk the merlin is dexterous enough to catch skylarks on the wing. Dúlra’s walked so much of our landscape that he must have encountered it somewhere, but probably dismissed it as just another thrush – which is exactly what it wants its prey to think as well. Conor goes to the coast at Dundalk where this bird of prey often spends the winter months. But the amazing thing is that rather than a story with a happy, Hollywood ending with the merlin making a star appearance, he actually fails to spot one. As he points out, wildle documentaries take years to make with untold misses – and it’s the journey into the Irish countryside with all its hidden layers that is the payoff.Conor’s hit-list of birds isn’t an end in themselves – they’re just one part of our country’s rich tapestry. One thing he has always loved about being Irish is that there is history everywhere you go, hanging in the air around you. Birds weave their way through this rich history, which Conor does his best to unravel.And he points out that the calls of birds that used to be much more common provide an aural window into a time now gone.He goes searching for a red grouse in the Wicklow Mountains. He takes one of Ireland’s most scenic routes, the Military Road, which was cut through the mountains to disrupt rebels after the rising of . Ireland’s only remaining species of grouse love these vast spaces, where they blend into the heather – occasionally as Dúlra used to walk on Black Mountain, one would burst into the air in front of him. This is a distinct Irish sub-species, but they live in such remove and separate mountain enclaves that the red grouse have become genetic islands, cut adrt from outsiders. The lack of genetic iety leaves them vulnerable.The grey partridge which Conor finds in the flat, productive fields of County Offaly is a fascinating, incredible bird. He calls them the rabbits of the bird world, scuttling about the grass in family groups. Flight, that ancestral safety mechanism, is only used as a last resort.Living in open spaces makes them exposed from air and ground, so to compensate the partridge lays more eggs than any other Irish bird –  is the record.The destruction of Ireland’s vast forests was a boon for the partridge, and the gentle rhythms of the farm synchronised with the bird’s lestyle, giving it ample time to rear its chicks before the crops were gathered. But from the s onwards, its prospects darkened dramatically as mechanisation destroyed nests.In healthy fields where the partridge should be found, they are now missing. A stable of Irish rural le was obliterated.By , there were only  left in the whole country. At Lough Boora in County Offaly, efforts were finally made to save it, with a nursery being set up and now there are a few hundred pairs breeding there.As Conor notes, the reintroduction of eagles and kites hog the headlines, but the humble partridge is no less noble a cause. In Offaly, they decided to save the habitat rather than one species. And the partridge is one of many winners.Conor goes to Tory Island to find the corncrake – as Dúlra has done ­– and to Conamara to find the cuckoo. But the most encouraging are the goosander ducks, síolta mhór in Irish. He finds them in the beautul Glendalough in County Wicklow. This is a large, colourful duck of wild, secluded lakes, but rather than nest at the water’s edge, it needs a tree hole – the most prized nesting real estate the forest has to offer, Conor writes.It’s almost impossible to find the right one at the water’s edge, but in Glendalough they made articial nests for the goosander which the birds have readily taken to. Thirty years ago breeding pairs were unheard of in Ireland – today it’s made a stronghold in County Wicklow, and there’s confidence that with public help, there’s no reason it won’t colonise the whole country.Ireland Through Bird has been shortlisted for Best Irish Published Book  – it certainly gets Dúlra’s vote."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a worthy tribute to kate","story":"SET against the backdrop of Robert Emmet’s  Irish Rebellion, Betrothed –written by the late theatre pioneer Kate Muldoon – will make its debut on the Grand Opera House stage in November.Chronicling the story of one of the most remarkable love triangles in Irish history, Kate’s work was completed shortly after the North Belfast woman passed away during Christmas .Starring as Emmet’s love Sarah Curran, Katie Tumelty described Kate’s writing as conveying a “powerful love story, a beautul piece of writing that really captures an era in time”.Directed by A Night In November’s Matthew McElhinney, Katie said she knew from the off “that I was going to do the piece”.“Matthew and I have a really good shorthand and work really well together,” she said. “We worked together recently on Archie In Manhattan and this is the first time he’s directed me. I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

Speaking ahead of the November  ballot closure, Unison’s RVH Joint Branch Secretary, Conor McCarthy, said workers were “sick, sore and tired of being treated as second class workers”.“TheTrusts are finding it very dficult to recruit and retain staff across all disciplines because every single health worker here is going to work every morning with lower pay than their counterparts across the rest of the UK,” he said.“Workers feel very undervalued. “They feel that the Trust, at executive level, aren’t speaking up for them.“The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, nor any of the other executives across the region, has yet to come out and say that health workers deserve pay parity.”Mr McCarthy insisted that money for a “pay parity” increase had been allocated through the Westminster Barnett Formula, and called into question what it “being used for”.He also insisted that pay parity would have overarching “positive implications” for local NHS staffing levels and waiting lists.“This is not just about pay,” he said.“Pay is the foundation of this dispute, but pay parity would lead to positive implications on waiting lists.“If people are paid properly and paid equally it will help with the recruitment and retention of staff. Therefore, more staff will be employed and there will be more staff available to bring down waiting lists.”Mr McCarthy said that, in the event of a yes vote, Unison members would be asked to take part in “sustained” industrial action including the withdrawal of labour, overtime bans, work to rule measures, and bank sht bans. However, the union hopes to receive a pay offer before then.“I have yet to see anything from the Trust or the Department expressing any anxiety over it,” he added.“The ballot is not finished yet, but it would be welcomedepartment and the Trust were to give out a statement to say that they support health workers in their stance over pay parity.”With the Unison ballot closing on Monday, Mr McCarthy has warned local political parties that industrial action could coincide with the December  Westminster election, and has urged candidates to support the workers in their calls for pay parity. “We have only had one email from a local MLAin regards to discussing the issue,” he said.“We want to give a strong message to the candidates who are running for the December election, which coincides with the time we would be on strike every single MP has pay parity. “Every single MP is paid the same, but their constituents aren’t. Emma Pengelly in South Belfast is paid the same as an MP in Manchester, but her health worker constituents aren’t. “Our MPs need to support the health workers in their stance on pay parity.”A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: “The decision to adopt localised NI pay rates for health staff was taken under devolution and it is not for civil servants to overturn previous Ministerial decisions.“The claims about the Barnett Formula providing money specically for pay increases are based on a misunderstanding – this is not how public funding or the Barnett Formula work.“To be very clear there is no separate or untapped source of funding for pay. It all comes out of the one health budget and money spent in one area cannot be spent in another.”A spokesperson for Belfast Trust said: #We understand the challenges facing our staff, and also recognise the right of staff to take industrial action. We are pleased that unions are prepared to work with us during this time, to ensure that patient safety is not compromised#."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is about Remain. That’s a fundamental block.”Ms Brinton added: “The second thing is Labour have made it plain that under their rules, they will never stand back for any other party.“And that I’m afraid is part of the old two-party style of politics.”Ms Brinton said that with their pact, the parties are demonstrating that there is a “new way” of doing politics.Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts said she hopes the parties coming together gives “some credibility” to politics.“Our message is clear.

Six other members of the operation received lesser sentences, ranging from six months to  years. Death sentences are almost always commuted to le in prison after the reprieve.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chinese and US enforcement officers hold a press conference on cracking down on fentanyl trafficking Working from a  tip from the US Department of Homeland Security about an online drug vendor who went by the name Diana, Chinese police busted a drug ring based in the northern city of Xingtai that shipped synthetic drugs illicitly to the US and other countries from a clandestine laboratory. They arrested more than  suspects and seized .kg of fentanyl and .kg of other drugs.The enterprise resembled a small business, with a perky sales force that spoke passable English, online marketing, contract manufacturing, and a sophisticated export operation, according to US and Chinese law enforcement.Liu and Jiang were accused of manufacturing and trafficking illicit drugs. The others were accused of trafficking.Chinese officials said the Xingtai case was one of three fentanyl trafficking networks they are pursuing based on US intelligence, but declined to discuss the details of the other cases, which are ongoing.Austin Moore, an attache to China for the US Homeland Security Department, said the Xingtai case was “an important step” showing that Chinese and US investigators can collaborate across international borders.Mr Moore said Chinese police identied more than  US residents who tried to buy fentanyl from the Xingtai organisation. Those leads prompted more than  domestic investigations and have already resulted in three major criminal arrests and indictments in New York and Oregon, he said.Scrambling to contain surging overdose deaths, Washington has blamed Beijing for failing to curb the supply of synthetic drugs that US officials say come mainly from China. In August, Donald Trump lashed out at Chinese President Xi Jinping for failing to do more to combat illicit opioid distribution in China’s chemicals industry. US officials have reportedly moved to link Beijing’s efforts on fentanyl to US trade talks.Yu Haibin, deputy director of the Office of China National Narcotics Control Commission, on Thursday called the allegations “irresponsible and inconsistent with the actual facts”.“Drug crime is the public enemy of all humankind,” he added. “It’s about the le of human beings. It should not be related with the trade war or other political reasons.”Chinese officials have been at pains to emphasise the efforts they have made to expand drug controls and crack down on illicit suppliers, even though synthetic opioid abuse is not perceived to be a signicant problem in China.But prosecuting cases against a new, rising class of Chinese synthetic drug kingpins has remained a challenge. Profit-seeking chemists have exploited regulatory loopholes by making small changes to the chemical structure of banned substances to create so-called analogs that are technically legal.US officials have been hopeful that China’s move earlier this year to outlaw unsanctioned distribution of all fentanyl-like drugs as a class will help constrain supply and make it easier to prosecute Chinese dealers.According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, more than , Americans died of drug overdoses in the decade ending in  — increasingly from synthetic opioids like the ones sold by the Xingtai network."},{"url":null,"title":"new zealand passes law aimed at combating climate change","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is an honour and privilege to do the work I do. “It is a wonderful feeling to help people, and so fantastic to share skills and techniques with children at a young age that they can carry with them and use for the rest of their lives.”Sarah says she hopes other schools in the area get on board with the Minding Mini Me, Overcoming Anxiety for Kids workshop.“We all go through so many ups and downs in le andchildren are aware of how they can help themselves, it gives them a much better chance to develop resilience to tackle what comes their way. “My own personal challenges due to having Multiple Sclerosis mean I have to draw on these skills regularly and I would like to share this with the children. “I want them to know that disability does not have to hold you back and the importance of being respectful of others with challenges. “This will all fit inreally well with the schools ethos and the fact they are marking anti bullying week when I am doing the workshops.”The Minding Mini Me workshops will take place on Wednesday, November  and Friday, November . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

He was the man in charge for England’s - semi-final win against New Zealand.A calf injury ruled him out of any involvement in Saturdays final between England and South Africa.But in typical Owens style, he noted that Frances Jerome Garces was deservedly selected to take charge of that game.When I got that semi-final appointment deep down I knew that was my last World Cup game, he told BBC Radio Wales.I wasnt feeling gutted I wasnt involved in the final. Yes the injury has ruled me out of the equation - I would have been part of the equation - but in all honesty I think Jerome Garces would have done the final whether I was injured or not and deservedly so.Hes refereed well in the World Cup, hes refereed extremely well over the last couple of years and I believeyouve done the World Cup final once, thensomeone  is reffing well enough then they deserve to do it before you do the second time. “ButOwens is not hanging up the whistle just yet.Im not done yet at domestic and international level, but at World Cup level that was my last game so I went into that game making sure I was going to enjoy every minute of it and I was going to do my best for the most important people in a World Cup semi-final - which was the players. What a great game to finish your World Cup career.Owens has had many highlights in his refereeing career, including the  World Cup final at Twickenham, where New Zealand beat Australia -.In May , he publicly came out as gay, and received consierable support. He said that coming out was a dficult decision, and that he had contemplated suicide at one time.He has been a leading figure in tackling homophobic abuse both within the sport and in wider society.Outside of the sport, he is also a TV personality in Wales, having presented a number of shows on the SC Welsh television station.Meanwhile, he is set to referee a Welsh game for the first time on November  when Wales face the Barbarians.He is getting special dispensation from World Rugby as officials are usually selected from neutral nations. googletag.cmd.push Nigel Owens Dinner“An Evening wIth Nigel Owens” will be held in the White Horse Hotel on Thursday, November , at . pm..

Our sessions are designed to be fun, interactive and engaging, whilst delivering an important message to help protect children in our local communities.Sacred Heart teacher, Laura Murray, said with construction works ongoing in the village, the school was keen to make use of the play safe, stay safe sessions to ensure pupils are aware of the dangers associated with building sites.She added: ldquoThe pupils really enjoyed the presentation and learning the safety code and it was great to have a safety expert deliver the session.St Malachyrsquos teacher, Odette Clarke said it was great to see the commitment from Phoenix Natural Gas to educating local children on the dangers of construction sites.She added: ldquoI would highly recommend this programme to other primary schools in the area.Phoenix says that it is committed to upholding the very highest standards in health and safety, which has been recognised internationally through numerous awards.To date, the lsquoplay safe, stay safersquo educational programme has been delivered to over , children and runs throughout the school calendar year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th November 2019 Ardarragh.jpg","title":"Ardarragh foodbank donation  ","story":"MEMBERS of the disability hub based at the Ardarragh Day Centre in Downpatrick have handed over a number of items to the townrsquos Fountain Foodbank.The presentation was made recently to the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, Shirley Lennon, by Anthony Sim and Tracy Hewitt.Shirley visited the local centre where she gave an inspiring talk about the key role Downpatrick Presbyterian Church plays in the foodbank.

street.There are real fears that with the Christmas rush just around the corner, more and more pirate traders will be moving into the Downpatrick area in search of rich pickings.Several traders have

shopkeepers.This week Down councillors decided to wage war on the pirates and legal action against one of them is to be brought before Downpatrick court next week.Chief public health officer, Mr Frank Nixon, said several of his staff had visited the area on a number of occasions and warned stallholders about illegal trading, but it still continued over a six-week period.On one occasion, Mr Nixon,

on business.The delay also had a knock-on effect on traffic congestion in other parts of the town as a result of the temporary one-way traffic system in Irish Street.Managed by the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities and Newry Mourne and Down Council, the public realm scheme resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street lighting and street furniture.The delay in completing the public realm work within the anticipated three-month timeframe was blamed on a number of factors, described as ldquounforeseen works issues that resulted in the loss of construction time and

The party enjoyed a major increase in its local council election vote earlier this year with party officials hoping that that success will be repeated next month. In , Alliance candidate Andrew McMurray polled , votes.Mr Hazzard says the election is an opportunity to reject the ldquoreckless Tory DUP Brexit and drive forward momentum for Irish unity.ldquoSinn Feacutein is ready for the election and to seize the opportunity to unseat Brexiteer DUP MPs across the north, he declared.ldquoIn the last Westminster election, the nationalist people sent a powerful message by turning its back on Westminster and ing seven Sinn Feacutein MPs, including an historic victory in South Down.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoGiven the catastrophe that Westminster is attempting to force upon our island it is vital that people here in South Down continue to show Dublin, Europe and the world that we still reject Brexit, borders and the DUP.Describing the Westminster poll as a ldquodefining election, Mr Savage said that local people deserved more than an empty seat in parliament.He declared: ldquoBrexit is a national emergency. It threatens people, jobs and businesses across this island and at a time of immense crisis, itrsquos just not good enough that our current MP has decided to abstain on this islandrsquos future.ldquoBoris Johnson, the DUP and others are delighted that itrsquos one less vote against their plans to privatise our health service and sell large chunks off to American profiteers. They are delighted that therersquos no one representing people here who oppose welfare cuts and austerity that have left the most vulnerable destitute.Mr Savage added: ldquoThis is a moment for leadership. My promise to people in South Down is that I will never abstain on our future. I will never abstain on the need for investment in people and communities here. I will never abstain on protecting the Good Friday Agreement or the people I represent. With no Executive and no Assembly for , days, our future is being decided in London and wersquore having no say in it. No more.Mr Hanna says he is looking forward to the election and that there are many issues which party voters are concerned about, including abortion and gay marriage.ldquoBrexit is undoubtedly going to be a key issue for many, in particular, those who work in the fishing industry. My priority will also be keeping the Union safe maintaining it is absolutely vital, he declared. ldquoOther issues people have raised with me include abortion and gay marriage.

I topped the poll in the Mournes DEA in the last council election, doubling my vote and believe that I am coming from a good  for this election.

She said Boris Johnsonrsquos deal with the EU represents an ldquoexistential threat to the Union, putting a border in the Irish Sea and placing Northern Ireland on ldquothe window ledge of the Union.She added: ldquoThe acceptance of a regulatory border by the DUP was vigorously opposed by my party. This decision has opened the floodgates for Boris Johnson and his dreadful deal. The Union itself is now in a precarious position because of these actions and its absolutely vital that MPs are ed to Westminster who will take their seats and be able to influence the future direction of our nation.Mr Brown said that more than ever, a progressive, liberal voice was needed in Westminster representing South Down and is looking forward to representing Alliance in an election which comes during a period of great uncertainty and instability in Northern Ireland.ldquoWhilst the DUP fail to represent the majority of people here and Sinn Fein donrsquot even bother showing up, every Alliance MP elected will deliver for everyone in our society, he said.The Alliance candidate said his priorities include stopping Brexit, protecting the environment and working tirelessly for constituents.He added: ldquoA vote for Alliance will be a vote against Brexit and put pressure on the UK Government to take immediate action to restore the Stormont institutions.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives.

I owe my family a huge debt of gratitude for allowing me, without ever a word of reproach, to spend so much time at Westminster they understood how much joy and satisfaction I had from working on behalf of others.“Now, however, my priorities for the next few years are to spend my time at home in Northern Ireland to see more of my family and to step back from the frontline of public le.”She added: “I should like to thank the many constituents and others from across Northern Ireland who have contacted me directly to offer their support and encouragement to stand again for re-election. All such messages are deeply appreciated, and I apologise most sincerely for any disappointment caused by my decision not to stand.“To all those volunteers who have given so generously of their time to help me in previous Westminster elections, I should also like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the streets walked and leaflets delivered. They made canvassing fun, despite the rain and wind we often had to endure.“Last, but certainly not least, I wish to thank the wonderful staff who have worked alongside me since I was first elected. Their loyalty, friendship and hard work lightened my load, and definitely sustained me through those years.“If my successor enjoys the role of MP for North Down half as much as I have done, a smile will constantly be on his or her face.”Lady Hermon said she would be making no further statement.

I was shocked by his deliberate isive rhetoric that is stoking anger.Even his own MPs were shocked at his attempt to claim the memory of Jo Cox in support for his demand to leave by October  regardless of the consequences.Describing death threats to MPs as humbug was a new low.Wersquore roughly a month away from potentially crashing out of the EU with no deal on October  and wersquore none the wiser as to how Boris Johnson plans to answer some of the major issues we face.The Prime Minister and his Brexit extremists donrsquot care the damaging impact that a no deal exit would have on our people, on jobs and public services.I have been very clear and consistent about the damage that a no deal Brexit would do.Letrsquos not forget, the people of Cardf South and Penarth voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the  EU Referendum.I will continue to work within my party and across political parties to ensure we arenrsquot dragged out of the EU without a deal against our will.Each day I meet with doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients who are genuinely concerned about the impact of a no deal Brexit on our NHS.Earlier this week I updated the Senedd on how health and social care across Wales are preparing for a no deal Brexit.I agreed to spend poundm of NHS Wales funds to purchase and stockpile essential medical supplies and equipment.To give some context, that poundm could have paid for seven replacement MRI scanners instead.I cannot overstate how much of my time has been taken up on no deal preparation.There is a huge amount of time energy and effort being spent on preparing for the worst possible outcome for our country.That is time energy and effort that should be going into improving health and care services for our staff and the people that they serve.This is not what the people voted for.We have to be honest with ourselves and the public - there is no easy answer to the Brexit farce.That includes my preferred answer of referendum, remain and reform of the EU.The recently announced plan by the Prime Minister to have customs checks in Ireland is a real threat to peace and security.That is not normal.The customs checks that would slow down goods including food and medicines are not normal.The prospect of a Prime Minister breaking the law ndash again ndash at the end of this month to deliver no deal is far from normal.I know any people are tired of Brexit but this is the biggest issue of our generation.Unless we put it back to the people in a referendum then I do not believe we will ever resolve our future within Europe and the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

I agree we need change, but going by the small number of people who actually wanted this it strikes me as something pushed through.ldquoFrom my perspective - and that of other residents here - the council could have been far more open and communicative during the process.Mike Clogg, Vale council operational manager for neighbourhood services and transport, said: ldquoThe council consulted widely on these proposals from May  to July  last year, a process that allowed residents to have their say by responding to the online survey, writing to the council or attending one of two drop-in sessions held at Belle Vue Pavilion.ldquoFour potential routes were proposed before this one was selected, a decision that was reached after  per cent of survey respondents identied this as their first or second choice.ldquoThe views of other interested parties were also considered, while there was also signicant media coverage on the matter.ldquoIt is dficult to please everyone when it comes to highway improvement schemes, but this project should be of major benefit to Penarth, improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.ldquoIt is part of a wider scheme of work involving building a new skate park at Penarth Leisure Centre and improvements to The Dingle Park.ldquoIt is hoped the scheme will encourage more people to walk to these locations and provide children with a safer route to the leisure centre and local schools.ldquoImprovements to the junction will also create a more attractive entrance to Penarth, while new plants, railings and public art will improve the appearance of The Dingle Park. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Their sole motive has been about blocking Brexit.I have long thought the only way out of this is a general election.The British people need to be given the opportunity to have a clear out of those politicians who said one thing to get elected and have done another in office.All Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on manestos explicitly promising to respect and honour the referendum result.The people of Penarth deserve better than this.Earlier this month, I was present on the steps of the Senedd as the petition to save the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital was presented to the Assembly.I joined other local representatives and campaigners from Unison to receive the petition, and send a clear message on the health boardrsquos proposals.Under the plans, the -bed older persons rehabilitation ward will close, with services transferring either to the community or Llandough Hospital.Local opinion in Barry is quite clear that the ward should stay, while in Llandough, further expansion of the hospital will cause further pressures on the village.You wonrsquot often catch me standing alongside Unison, but on this we completely agree.These plans need to be dropped.The Royal British Legion have officially launched the  Poppy Appeal, and as ever, I am delighted to pledge my support.It is crucial we commemorate those who made the ultimate sacrice to defend our freedoms, including those from Penarth.Wearing a poppy is an understated yet clear way of demonstrating that, and it also raises vital funds to support current and former servicemen and women and their families.It is often misunderstood as condoning or celebrating war, and that could not be further from the truth. It is respecting those who have fallen.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Royal British Legion for their work. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
