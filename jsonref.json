It refers to the phenomenon by which well-meaning public figures, who seek to advertise their eco-friendly credentials – while simultaneously globe-trotting – inevitably put themselves at risk of ending up with a serious dollop of egg on their face.Just such a situation faced Prince Harry this week, after Elton John sought to defend the royal eco-warrior\u0027s recent private jet journey to the South of France – one of four his family has taken in recent days – by announcing: \u0027We ensured their flight was carbon neutral, by making the appropriate contribution to Carbon Footprint.\u0027So what exactly is Carbon Footprint and does it deliver?The Basingstoke-based firm, which allows concerned citizens to \u0027offset\u0027 their personal carbon emissions for a small fee, is run by a husband and wife couple, John and Wendy Buckley.It\u0027s a leading player in a rapidly-growing industry which seeks to provide a quick and easy means for customers to feel like they are combating climate change – without having to do anything more than write a small cheque.         ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskiesTo supporters, carbon offsetting offers a pragmatic and relatively hassle-free means for the public to repair some of the damage caused by their modern lifestyles. It also allows celebrities (and royals) to sidestep at least some allegations of hypocrisy as they set off on yet another ski, beach or safari holiday.Yet the industry is also the subject of fierce criticism, particularly among environmentalists, who see it as a highly-unethical form of so-called \u0027greenwashing\u0027.Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a \u0027con\u0027 and Greenpeace have described its methodology as \u0027dodgy\u0027.The campaigner George Monbiot has dubbed carbon offsetting \u0027pernicious and destructive nonsense\u0027, comparing offsetting to the Medieval system of \u0027indulgences\u0027 via which wealthy people could buy pardons from the Catholic church to supposedly atone for their sins, without altering their destructive behaviour.Carbon Footprint were unavailable for comment yesterday, but say on their website: \u0027Carbon offsetting is a way to reduce the emissions that you can\u0027t. It both helps to combat global climate change as well as caring for local communities.\u0027But as Monbiot and many other opponents see it, the only way to prevent climate change is to stop flying in the first place.         Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate changeAll of which meant that while acknowledging the good intentions, it wasn\u0027t long before critics began to argue that Sir Elton\u0027s claim that the private flight was \u0027carbon neutral\u0027 was nonsense.Leading the charge was Greenpeace\u0027s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, who said carbon offsetting was not a \u0027meaningful response\u0027 to flight emissions.How, then, has such a lucrative industry developed?At its most basic level, carbon offsetting companies use money paid by clients (minus a small fee) to finance a variety of projects that take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or prevent it being emitted.Some might plant trees (which absorb CO2) in the UK and abroad, others finance projects to distribute energy efficient stoves, or lightbulbs to the developing world.One scheme financed by Carbon Footprint repairs broken boreholes – which give communities access to clean drinking water – in Uganda. That means, in theory at least, they no longer have to cut down trees and burn them in order to make fires to boil water.Another pays for trees to be planted at schools in the UK. Beneficiaries have included Ivybridge Primary, near Twickenham Stadium, where nearly 1.300 saplings were planted on the border of a playing field last year, and an unnamed school near the Hertfordshire studios where the new Spider-Man film was made.It was recently given 72 saplings by Carbon Footprint client Sony pictures (one for each day of filming) to turn into a native hedge.Projects may also support solar energy or wind farm schemes, or pay to protect threatened areas of the Amazon rainforest from logging. An auditing process then establishes how much carbon each project has \u0027offset\u0027 each year, for example by working out how much CO2 an inidual sapling will convert into oxygen. Customers can then tailor their payments accordingly.Buy a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York, and you will be told that you are producing 0.96 tons of CO2. For £7, on top of your ticket price, a company called ClimateCare will \u0027offset\u0027 those particular emissions.ClimateCare is another big player in the offsetting industry. Clients are reported to include David Cameron, in his days of hugging huskies, and Emma Thompson, the Hollywood actress who recently flew First Class to London from Los Angeles to join Extinction Rebellion protests against climate change.Founded in 2007, it now puts between £10million to £20million a year into its projects.Carbon Footprint – as favoured by Elton John – is also doing well: last year, its assets increased by £375,000 to £1,531,775.All very well and good. Yet critics regard their lucrative line of business with disdain.\u0027Offsetting is a con,\u0027 Friends Of The Earth has stated. \u0027It encourages businesses and iniduals to carry on polluting when we urgently need to reduce our carbon emissions. It allows people to develop the mindset that it\u0027s OK to carry on polluting if green schemes in far-off locations make up for it.\u0027         Friends Of The Earth have repeatedly called offsetting a \u0027con\u0027 and Greenpeace have described its methodology as \u0027dodgy\u0027 (stock image)Sceptics point out that many offsetting schemes take ages to have a significant effect. Newly planted trees may never mature, and even if they do, won\u0027t reach peak CO2 reducing powers for decades, whereas the carbon we release by driving or flying is going into the atmosphere immediately. They also say the real effect of offsetting projects is hugely tricky to measure, since it\u0027s never entirely clear how much carbon is actually taken out of the atmosphere by them.Meanwhile, you never really know whether the wind farm financed by donations from offsetting firms might have been built anyway.\u0027Just as in the 15th and 16th centuries you could sleep with your sister and kill and lie without fear of eternal damnation, today you can live exactly as you please as long as you give your ducats to one of the companies selling indulgences,\u0027 Monbiot has written.Others have criticised the impact of offsetting projects on indigenous communities, likening it to a form of colonialism.In 2017, a controversy erupted in Ecuador over a Californian project to turn 2.5 million hectares of forest into a reserve. Indigenous people were told they were no longer allowed to gather firewood or hunt in traditional tribal areas.Then there are environmental problems caused by some carbon-capturing trees. A 2017 report by Kew Gardens observed that huge \u0027monoculture\u0027 plantations of thirsty eucalyptus, a plant that is especially good at soaking up CO2, were using up valuable water required by developing communities, and also increasing the danger of forest fires, since they are highly flammable.Yet for all that, offsetting continues to grow. While supporters accept that some providers, particularly in the early days, were \u0027cowboys\u0027, they say the industry has improved its methods considerably and disasters of the sort that befell Coldplay are now unlikely.Though it remains unregulated, supporters say that a trade body called the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance, which now has 14 members, help consumers identify reputable offsetting companies, and ensures their work is properly audited.\u0027I am actually in violent agreement with Friends Of The Earth and Greenpeace,\u0027 says Edward Hanrahan, of ClimateCare. \u0027Like them, I accept the best way to reduce your emissions is not to take that flight in the first place. But I am also a pragmatist, and believe in dealing with the world as we find it. So while what we do isn\u0027t a perfect solution, I would say that offsetting is the most effective option around today.\u0027 In other words, it\u0027s better than doing nothing.But, as Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are doubtless starting to realise, you can either be an environmentalist, or you can fly in private jets.But no matter how many trees you plant, you will never truly be able to do both."},{"url":null,"title":"Deputies called Kanye West neighbors fed construction noise","story":"Share this articleKanye West\u0027s Dome-Like Housing Prototypes Up-Close in New PicsKanye West\u0027s Neighbors Call Cops Over Sunday Construction at Dome Site"},{"url":null,"title":"British Airways ADMITS delayed misplaced 150 000 bags year","story":"Share this article \u0027We still have no explanation why the bag was lost in the first place, why it was sent elsewhere, and why it is taking nearly a week to be returned to us, when I could have flown back and forth to London FIVE times in the same period.\u0027For the upset, inconvenience, loss of irreplaceable honeymoon celebrations and memories, and the total lack of customer care, I write this largely to try to get BA to give a toss.\u0027Marketing company owner Sue Duris, 57, was travelling from Heathrow to Edinburgh last week on business but her bag did not arrive with her in Scotland. Ms Duris, of Guildford, Surrey, was told her case would arrive the next day in Edinburgh, but after rushing to the the airport she was informed it was at Heathrow.

More than 400 flights were cancelled or delayed, leaving BA potentially facing a £16million compensation bill.Passengers were forced to go to check-in desks where staff tried to process the backlog manually. It took BA ten hours to sort the problem out, but by then passengers were stranded in Japan, Paris and the US.BA has been plagued by previous IT issues. In 2017 a power outage at Heathrow stranded tens of thousands of passengers over the May bank holiday weekend. The airline is also facing a record £183million fine after hackers stole the personal details of up to half a million passengers last year. A threat of a pilots\u0027 strike at BA still hangs over hundreds of thousands of Britons who have booked flights with the airline this summer. The protest involving around 4,000 workers at Heathrow, including security staff and engineers, will still go ahead if they reject an improved pay offer. A walkout scheduled for the start of the month was suspended.One of the world\u0027s biggest airlines, BA made record profits of almost £2billion last year, flying more than 145,000 passengers a day. The carrier, in its centenary year, employs around 4,500 pilots – with captains paid an average of £167,000."},{"url":null,"title":"Paragliding Cockapoo takes skies Wales owners called Britains bravest pet","story":"Share this article His owner\u0027s partner said the fearless flying pooch is \u0027unflappable\u0027 and \u0027always calm\u0027 when he flies. \u0027Cockapoos are really lovely natured, gentle and caring dogs,\u0027 he said.\u0027He doesn\u0027t shed so is a brilliant house dog but loves to go out.

It involves a fist bump, a finger point and a chest pat. Most of us will never understand it, but we will see it.A photograph of the handshake is now on view in various bus stops across all five boroughs of New York City until 24 November. It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.” “Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One image shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7407a85c1c1d26b31ab5cd2da7b69c552c162c2b/51_1434_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07281d46b0f96fa2eeda019f6132fa83","title":"bauhaus 100 review a celebration of an art school that was truly radical","story":"From tracing its post-war roots to putting today’s artists to the test, BBC Four’s night at the Bauhaus was illuminating and funTo mark the centenary of the endlessly influential art school’s foundation by Walter Gropius, BBC Four spent a night in the Bauhaus. It began with a half-hour trot through the life and pioneering artwork of Anni Albers, in A Life in Thread. From her banishment to the weaving workshop (where female students were expected to go instead of metalwork or other departments – progressive institutions always have surprisingly traditional limitations) we witnessed her transformation of the ancient craft into unique art and a lauded career.Then we had an hour of Bauhaus at 100, tracing its roots as a reaction against expressionism and a bid to put the pieces of a shattered postwar world back together in a new and better way. Whether it worked is an open question. The school was effectively shut down by the increasingly powerful Nazi regime in 1933 and the programme was bookended by a discussion about the controversial decision to cancel a recent event at the Bauhaus building (now a Unesco heritage site) after far-right activists threatened to disrupt it. But, as one of the contributors noted, no experiment in creativity can ever really be said to have failed. Let alone one in whose influence we are still steeped today, with whose designs – both typographical and architectural – we still live, even if we have not kept hold of the idealistic message the marriage of form and function was intended to convey.After all that edutainment, you might have felt ready for a bit of fun. Along came Bauhaus Rules, presented by “Jim Moir, AKA Vic Reeves” – as he was billed in the credits – to provide. The unashamed gimmick here was to take a handful of art students and give them a different Bauhaus-based task, overseen by a different artist, every day for a week and see how they took to the school rules. Ian Whittlesea did the breathing exercises that Johannes Itten, who developed the Bauhaus “preliminary course” that still forms the basis for all art foundation courses, believed helped expand the self-awareness vital for artists. If you find yourself bursting with opinions about the self-awareness of artists, see me after class. They take such things seriously here, even while munching on the garlic mush Itten insisted students eat as part of his commitment to Mazdaznan (a fire cult don’t worry about it). Then they had to make some art out of contrasting materials. Whittlesea’s response to one piece – “So little evident work” – was the most beautifully constructed thing of all.It was fun – a neat way of giving life to the beliefs and theories that animated the Bauhaus founders and, at times, even providing a glimpse into varying artistic temperaments. On the day, Kandinsky’s correspondence theory got a run-out (this is the theory that all circles are essentially blue, triangles yellow and squares red, and you can go and eat more garlic mush if you prefer) some thrived on the rigidity of it, while others … did not. “I don’t agree with it,” said Amar, while Lizzy reckoned: “I trust myself more than Kandinksy.” Oh, to be young and confident again.It also returned to points raised by the earlier programmes. When the students were tasked by Kate Butler, the head of product design at Habitat, with producing a (useful, beautiful) domestic item, we learned that as well as discouraging women from metalwork, the Bauhaus founders believed women could not think in 3D. Marianne Brandt insisted on doing both, eventually succeeding the metalshop master László Moholy-Nagy and producing iconic modern industrial works still revered and imitated today. She must have been quite the headscratcher (and surely worth a half-hour to herself). Also noted was Itten’s transformation from spiritually alert artist into man with a hard-on for eugenics and no issue with the seam of Aryanism that ran through his chosen cult, which went unmentioned in the formal documentary.Overall it was a night that conveyed the wonderment that attends the invention of something genuinely radical and new. Because it has shaped our world so thoroughly over the last 100 years, the awe at the achievement – at any such widely adopted achievement – needs to be periodically disinterred and felt anew. So little evident work, it seems now. Yet this gave back the notion that it wasn’t little work at all. It was a vision of a better world, expressed through all forms of art. How amazing. And how surpassingly impossible it seems now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fee12007e99667a2fe9c28b60f71725052b798e7/140_1759_6505_3903/master/6505.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72d5ad01ac72b18bef28e51654c2f1e4","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work by the late South African photographer that offers nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary South Africa.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

We have an increasing number refusing to attempt mocks and actual exams. This has never happened before.”Almost all of the more than 500 school leaders contacted by ASCL agreed that the reformed exams, introduced by the former education secretary Michael Gove, were harder than the previous version. Several said the new format put less able students and those with special educational needs (Sen) at a greater disadvantage.“Making exams harder doesn’t make kids smarter or more employable. It does make them more stressed, anxious and depressed – especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds,” one senior teacher told ASCL.Another said it was “soul-destroying” to see well-prepared students struggle to cope: “The difficulty of reformed GCSEs places undue stresses upon students and staff. The sheer volume of examinations in such a short space of time leads to tired and weary students.”Another asked: “Why does a 16-year-old need to sit between 23 and 27 papers? Why do they need to be examined for seven and a half hours in English?”The new exams were introduced in 2017, when English and maths were the first to use the harder content and new grading from 9 to 1, replacing letter grades up to A*. This summer another tranche of new courses, including design and technology, were switched to the new format.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Exams are an essential part of ensuring that young people have acquired the knowledge and skills they need, but should never be at the expense of a young person’s wellbeing.“We trust schools to work with parents and support young people so they do their best.”Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, said the findings showed that the new GCSEs had “sacrificed” the interests of vulnerable students in favour of the most able.“In the longer term we simply must review the exam system to find a more humane way in which we can assess the abilities of young people and prepare them for their lives,” Barton said.The comments by school leaders matched those reported by the NEU, which polled more than 600 members who taught GCSE subjects in England. More than seven out of 10 said their students’ mental health had worsened since the new exams were introduced.Teachers told the NEU that the harder content was causing pupils to “switch off” and lose interest in coursework. “It is just focused on memorisation rather than engagement and application. There’s no joy in learning anymore,” one said.The survey also revealed that more schools in England were starting GCSE courses in Year 9, three years before exams are taken in Year 11.The comments about the new style GCSEs only apply to England, although Wales and Northern Ireland have also reformed their exam systems. Northern Ireland this year introduces a new C* grade, to align its grades with the 9-1 system used in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87ae9b9c407122d87e0a9c79b5c1235e705b6cb2/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9a48f43eca6959d015665415b39fcc8 1400w","title":"the new rules of socks novelty ones are out but yes you can wear them with sandals","story":"Socks are the new fashion statement, but are white ones in? Is cotton best? And should they always be pulled up? Here is the long and short of itYou may have noticed that socks aren’t what they used to be. Think back: for a long time socks were just something you used to cover your feet. Possibly black, probably ankle-height and definitely an afterthought. Socks are now an important part of your outfit at the least, the making of an outfit at most.Socks have become an area of diplomacy and woke-signalling – the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau is perhaps the biggest name to use socks in this way, choosing pointedly themed ones for public occasions. Or a telling insight into a political mind: Boris Johnson was criticised recently for not washing his lucky socks, emblazoned with a ruler of the Neo-Assyrian empire King Ashurbanipal, often enough.In fashion, statement socks have been big for a few years. In 2017, kicked off by the Vetements’ socks with the DHL logo teeT-shirt, they became “the most loaded accessory of the year”, according to the GQ columnist Justin Myers. Prada played with pulling socks up to men’s knees and, thanks to logomania, socks have become a more affordable way for fashion fans to conspicuously buy into their favourite designer labels.If none of this is ringing any bells, then it might mean it’s time to reassess your sock game. This is where the rules come in, because, in the words of Monica Geller from Friends: “Rules help control the fun.” EVBWhat kind of socks would you like to wear? Given the proliferation of styles, there is a good sock option for everyone. According to the stylist Bemi Shaw, you can never go wrong with a sports sock. “They add a bit of edge to a basic outfit and make streetwear look more authentic.”A Matisse-bright pair, like you’ll find at Arket, is an easy way to elevate a thrown-on outfit. At John Lewis, according to Elena Bergonzi, a fashion accessories buyer, classic sport socks are proving popular, “but also glitter and animal prints for the fashion-forward customer”. EVBTo this, the answer is a definite: Yes. But again, make clear it is deliberate. As the sock-styling expert and Man Repeller journalist Harling Ross has noted, explicit coordination makes it clear that any unusual use of accessories is intentional. If you’re feeling a bit hesitant, see the sophisticated version of the socks and sandals look as touted at the most recent Agnona show. Socks were paired with sandals of the same shade or just a little different a subtler way to dip a toe. Or, one step up: look to the styling of duck-egg-blue socks with navy-blue sandals at springsummer 2020 Sies Marjan menswear show. EVB“Is there another way to wear your socks?” Shaw asks. For her, pulling them up “looks the best but also avoids the awkward bunching that can look like cankles”.There’s an easy sartorial win to be had for men in shorts and sports socks just by pulling them up – but be sure to look like you mean it. Charlie Teasdale, Esquire’s style director, also thinks socks should be pulled up “in any vaguely formal situation” – he even suggests, “if you were so inclined”, investing in some sock suspenders. EVBMost socks are made from a blend of materials and those that include elastane are likely to be a better, more comfortable fit. Bamboo fibre socks absorb moisture and boast antibacterial and antifungal properties. “Bamboo socks aren’t quite as green as they may appear, due to the processing of the bamboo and dyes,” says Steve Hynd, campaign manager at City to Sea. “Look out for organic cotton certified by Gots (global organic textile standard), which means your socks will be independently checked throughout the supply chain. Also, don’t throw out your old socks – and wash them in a Guppy bag to ensure you don’t leach microplastics as you wash.”No one does socks quite like Tyler, the Creator – see his white socks with beige Teva sandals. The mid-90s director Jonah Hill is another man unafraid of a bold sock – pull up your tube socks and channel the confidence of someone who has been variously called an “style saviour” and “ultimate purveyor of dad fashion”.As Myers puts it: “If you are going sockless, make sure you … wear socks.” This is where trainer socks come in. In our post-Victorian era, it is not always necessary to cover your ankles – but fashion’s ongoing love-in with sports shoes means socks are still essential if you don’t want an unpleasant waft.As visible socks are an easy to way to communicate fashion prowess, and there are so many trend-driven styles available, it makes almost no sense to conceal them. However, if you are opting for invisible socks, the clue is in the name. Make sure that the sock is well hidden – ill-fitting elastic bands that poke out from around the edges of your shoes are never a good look. LHThe thing about socks is everyone wears themneeds themloves them. The trick is to steer clear of novelty socks and instead buy a style they wouldn’t normally buy themselves. “Granted, it seems odd to go north of £20 on one pair,” says Teasdale “but really good socks are the same as really good shoes.” SCIt may have connotations of last-minute daduncleteachersecret Santa present, but herein lies the thing about socks: everyone wears themneeds themloves them. The trick is to steer clear of novelty socks (an unsustainable gimmick that they’ll never wear) and instead buy a style they wouldn’t normally buy themselves. “Granted, it seems odd to go north of £20 on one pair,” says Teasdale, “but really good socks are the same as really good shoes – if you spend a bit more they will wear better and last you longer.” Teasdale points in the direction of Arket (“nowhere near £20, but you could buy someone a bundle”) and the Workers Club. “They make excellent merino wool socks in cool colours if you want to splash out.” SC“Nope,” continues Teasdale. “Colour and print, absolutely. Go mad. But if you need your ankles to tell jokes for you, then socks are the least of your worries.” SC This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But, as any restaurant chef or resourceful home cook will tell you, your icebox is your best friend. Used well, it will sort out pretty much any culinary predicament: dessert options for unexpected guests, lunchbox treats for last-minute outings, emergency dinners for impatient toddlers. All it takes is a little prep and some good ideas. Here are a few to get you going.Maz Demir, executive chef at the Turkish restaurant Skewd Kitchen in LondonSlice the tops off two medium oranges and scoop out the flesh, taking care not to break the skin. Blitz the flesh in a blender, then sieve to obtain the juice. Mix in 2 tbsp honey, then pour into a freezer box and place in the freezer, along with the empty orange skin cups. After 24 hours, break up the sorbet with a fork to obtain a smooth texture. When ready to eat, fill the orange cups with sorbet and garnish with fresh mint.Masaki Sugisaki, executive chef at the Japanese restaurant Dinings in LondonFreezing, then defrosting firm tofu over a sieve is a great trick for draining it of its water (instead of weighting it down to press the water out), thereby creating an excellent meat-like texture. Once defrosted, slice into thick slabs and fry, glazing with teriyaki sauce or mince and use as you would minced meat. Try mixing 300g with 200g onion and 50g shiitake mushrooms (both chopped and fried), 50g panko breadcrumbs, a little soy milk and some flour to bind, and shape into patties. In a saucepan, bring to the boil 360ml mirin, 280ml soy sauce, 200g sugar, 1 tbsp gochujang, 1 tbsp minced ginger and 1-2 minced garlic cloves, thicken with cornflour, and drizzle over the patties.Tom Kitchin, chef patron of Michelin-starred restaurant The Kitchin, EdinburghFreeze the loose grapes that fall off the bunch and use as healthy sweet snacks – mini sorbets, if you will.Sam Pearman, executive chef of The Talbot, in Malton, Yorkshire, and the Swan, in Ascott-under-Wychwood in the CotswoldsPlace 100g halved and stoned victoria plums in a large saucepan with 250g sugar, one cinnamon stick, one star anise and 150ml water. Simmer for 8-10 minutes. Remove the plums and stir gently until the liquid thickens, then pour over the plums and set aside to cool. Place 50g of the cooled compote in a blender with 100g sugar, 100ml plain yoghurt and a splash of water. Blitz until smooth, then pour into six lolly moulds and freeze. Freeze the rest of the compote in inidual servings to use as a topping for yoghurt, ice-cream or porridge.Heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Line a baking tray with a sheet of baking paper. Roll out a sheet of puff pastry and spread over 100g tomato sauce (I make a sneaky veg version blitzing a tin of chopped tomatoes with some garlic and olive oil-roasted veg: courgette, onion, squash, aubergine). Sprinkle with 50g grated cheese and 1 tsp dried oregano, then roll up along the long side. Slice into 12 segments then bake, flat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden. Allow to cool then freeze inidually. Great for packed lunches: a frozen one placed in a lunchbox in the morning will be defrosted by midday.Food writer and broadcaster Nadiya HussainHeat the oven to 220C200C fan425Fgas mark 7. Scrub eight medium potatoes clean then prick them with a fork (so they don’t explode), lay them flat and microwave for 10 minutes. Turn them over and microwave for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix one finely chopped red onion, 1 tsp garlic paste, 300g full-fat cottage cheese, ½ tsp paprika and ½ tsp salt. Place the cooked potatoes on to two large baking trays, drizzle with oil and sprinkle generously with salt, then slice them in half lengthways. Taking care not to pierce the skins, scoop the flesh into the bowl holding the onion mixture. Combine, then spoon back to fill the skins. Drizzle with sriracha and sprinkle with 100g red leicester cheese, fresh or frozen (I always have some in the freezer). Bake for 20 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling and golden. Set aside as many as you need for dinner, serving sprinkled with chopped spring onions, and freeze the rest uncovered until firm, then wrap them inidually in foil and put back in the freezer to be used one by one.Nadiya Hussain’s Time to Eat (Michael Joseph) is out now.Ollie Templeton, head chef and co-owner of the London restaurant CarouselGyoza pastry wrappers from an Asian supermarket usually come in packs of 50, so prepping them all in advance and freezing avoids waste and ensures you have a ready-to-cook batch to hand. Squeeze the juice out of 200g kimchi into a small bowl and set aside. Mix the kimchi with 200g diced and sauteed potatoes in another bowl. To fill, lay one wrapper on the palm of your hand, place a teaspoon of filling in its centre and wet the edge with your finger. Fold in half over the filling and pinch in the middle, then pleat the top layer at regular intervals and press on to the back layer to seal. Freeze in small batches. To eat, fry from frozen in vegetable oil over medium heat. Serve immediately, dipping into soy sauce mixed with lemon juice.Food blogger and cookbook author Niki WebsterBlitz 100g pecans in a food processor or high-speed blender, then add 40g ground almonds, 2 tbsp flaxseeds, 2 tbsp nut butter, 2 tbsp raw cacao and 8 pitted medjool dates, and blitz until everything comes together. Press into a 20cm loose-bottomed cake or tart tin with your hands, then put into the freezer. Wash out your food processor (or blender) and add in 150g pitted medjool dates, 2 tbsp nut butter, 125ml plant-based milk, 2 tbsp coconut oil and 1 tsp salt. Blitz for a few minutes, until smooth and creamy. Dollop on to the pie base and smooth out, then return to the freezer for at least one hour. Toast 150g pecans in a dry pan over a medium heat for a few minutes, until lightly coloured, then place in a concentric circle pattern over the pie to decorate. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and store in the freezer. To serve, remove the pie 30–45 minutes before eating, to sit at room temperature.Rebel Recipes by Niki Webster is published by Bloomsbury in DecemberColin Clague, executive chef at Anatolian restaurant Rüya in LondonCut eight sheets of filo pastry into 15x18cm rectangles. In a bowl, shred any leftover pastry and mix with a chopped handful of flat-leaf parsley, some chopped dill, one grated medium carrot, 120g grated courgette, 300g crumbled feta and four egg yolks. Mix well to combine. Place 1-2 spoonfuls of feta mixture towards the bottom of a rectangle, finely grate over some walnuts, then fold over the edges, brush with egg wash and roll tightly.

Scatter with grated frozen feta and fresh herbs to serve.Jacob Kenedy, chef patron of Plaquemine Lock, Gelupo and Bocca di LupoThe pastry ratio to follow is four parts butter to five parts flour and two parts ice water. For the perfect pie, cut 240g butter into 300g flour (with a pinch of salt), then add 120ml ice water and bring into a dough – do not overmix. Either freeze now, or make the pie to freeze and cook later: roll out half the dough and press into a pie case. Fill with 1kg of fruit (fresh or frozen – diced apples, peaches or pears, halved apricots, whole blackberries, blueberries …) tossed with 150g sugar, 40g cornflour, 40ml lemon juice and ½ tsp cinnamon.

Which Antipodean nation can take credit for it, however, is unclear – though the combination of meringue and cream is far older than Anna herself, both countries claim the pavlova as their own.The safest course to steer seems to be that of Helen M Leach, who, having reviewed the evidence in her book The Pavlova Cake: the Evolution of a National Dish, declares her “preferred, more diplomatic conclusion is that we are dealing with a case of convergent cultural evolution.”What is indisputable is that, whether summer comes in December or July, whether it brings rambutans or raspberries, pavlova is the perfect dessert when you want to make the most of the season’s fruit with something a bit fancier than Eton mess. Not the height of fashion, perhaps, but like ballet itself, always a joy to behold.It may be hidden beneath layers of fruit and cream, but the meringue base is what separates a decent pavlova (because really, it’s very hard to make something bad from meringue and cream) from a truly great one. Though anything involving whipped egg whites tends to strike fear into the slapdash cook’s heart (I speak personally), meringues are in fact very easy to make, as long as you follow a few basic rules, all of which revolve around keeping the whites as far as possible from anything that will burst their bubbles. Separate your eggs with meticulous care to avoid getting even the merest smidgen of fat in the whites (or substitute ready-separated egg whites if you don’t plan to make carbonara or custard with the spare yolks), and use a scrupulously clean metal or glass bowl and whisk to whip them up – any grease or washing-up liquid will stop them achieving their full potential.Many recipes add a little acid to help stabilise the foam, in the form of cream of tartar or vinegar or starch, in the form of cornflour or arrowroot (or all of the above, if you’re Bill Granger). But as Delia Smith tartly notes: “I never make this with the traditional cornflour and vinegar, since side-by-side comparisons have revealed very little difference”. She’s right – her meringue, made solely from egg whites and sugar, is pretty perfect, while some of the starch heavy versions have an unpleasant powdery finish. However if, like me, you’re not Delia Smith, it’s easier to get maximum volume with the help of a little cream of tartar or similar.The more sugar you use, the crisper, and of course sweeter, the end result. Oddly, we discover, it is possible for a meringue to be too sweet, and – traditionally at least – the pavlova should still have “the promise of squidginess” in the middle, as Nigella Lawson puts it so beautifully in her book, Forever Summer. Most of the recipes I try use somewhere between 150-175g per three egg whites, with the exception of Maggie Beer, who goes for 330g, possibly because she’s pairing it with acidic fruit in this particular instance. For a more versatile recipe, however, I’m going to keep the sugar content fairly low.Yotam Ottolenghi and Helen Goh heat the meringue mixture while whisking, more like an Italian meringue, which does indeed give it a beautifully voluminous consistency, but we’ve no complaints about Smith’s version. More important, for a really luscious middle, is not to let it completely dry out in the oven, as you would with crisper meringues – that “promise of squidge” is important – a fairly low temperature is still desirable, however, so it doesn’t caramelise. If you want it to sit for a while you might consider painting the base with melted chocolate, as Ottolenghi and Goh do, to form a protective barrier between cream and meringue.Lawson also recommends a family tip from Australian food writer Stephanie Alexander referenced in How To Eat, which is to turn the meringue base over before smearing it with cream, so “the marshmallow middle melds with cream and the sides and the base stay crisp”, though I prefer the look of them built up around the edge, which of course is impossible to achieve upside down.You can flavour the meringue with brown sugar, which Ottolenghi and Goh credit for the “gooey, almost toffee-like” consistency of their base. Lawson flavours hers with cocoa powder and chocolate chips, which create luscious little pockets of bitterness. But my preference is vanilla, which goes with almost anything, though here I’ve chosen to flavour the cream instead. Experiment – if it goes with sugar, it’ll probably work. Note that a pinch of salt is always a good idea in very sweet desserts like this, but don’t add it until your meringue has formed, or it’ll take an age to whip up.Ottolenghi and Goh use a mixture of mascarpone and cream in Sweet, which gives a firmer, richer, silkier consistency – and flavour it with almond praline, blitzed to a powder to give a wonderful nutty caramel flavour that pairs perfectly with the cinnamon in their meringue. It also, of course, adds to the work involved, but, as someone notes when I post a picture online, “you had me at praline cream. I mean, you could give me a bowl of just that and I’d happily smother to death in it”.This will, of course, depend on what’s available near you – Beer’s stewed gooseberry version is a revelation to me, showing why passion fruit pavlova is so popular in its homeland. Acidity is key here as a contrast to the sweet meringue and bland richness of the cream, which is why the redcurrants work so well in Smith’s red fruit selection, so whatever you go for, if it’s very sweet, consider tossing it with a little lemon juice before adding it to the dish.That said, not every pavlova has fruit: Nigella’s cappuccino version in Nigellissima is topped only with cocoa powder.For those in northern climes, the joy of fresh fruit is enough in itself not to require anything in the way of gilding, but unless you’re using something a bit crunchy, such as passion fruit, the flaked almonds or pistachios in Ottolenghi and Goh’s recipe add textural interest. Or, embrace decadence and shave some chocolate on top as Lawson suggests. After all, there’s no such thing as too much when it comes to pavlova.4 egg whites¼ tsp cream of tartar, or ½ tsp lemon juice or vinegar225g caster sugar 1 pinch salt250ml whipping cream (or 350ml if you aren’t using yoghurt)100ml Greek yoghurt if using sweeter fruit, otherwise, use 350ml cream1 tsp vanilla extract500g fruit, stewed with sugar to taste, if necessary, and cooled1 squeeze lemon juice if using sweeter fruitHeat the oven to 140C (120C fan)gas 1 and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.Whisk the egg whites in a clean, dry, metal or glass bowl until frothy, then add the cream of tartar and whip to soft peaks.

If you own a stand mixer, the process of kneading the dough will be much easier. If working by hand, try to choose a cold day and be prepared to keep putting your dough back in the fridge. Other than that, brioche is not as difficult as it looks. Just take your time with it – the fridge is your friend – and enjoy the light yet very buttery crumb. Makes: 2 turtle brioches, plus extra dough to bake for dipping Prep time: 20 minutes to make dough (a bit longer if working by hand), plus overnight rest, then 20 minutes to shape dough, plus proving timeFor the brioche dough: 450g strong white flour8g salt10g fast-actinginstant yeast125ml whole milk4 medium eggs225g unsalted butter (room temperature, cubed)Plus: 1 beaten egg (for egg wash) 1 round camembert (250g or so) and veg sticks for dipping If using a stand mixer, add all the dough ingredients (apart from the butter), then let the machine knead using the dough hook for seven minutes. Add the butter gradually, kneading well after each addition, until it is all incorporated. If working by hand, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk and eggs. Pour the wet over the dry and stir with a spoon until it forms a rough dough. Tip this on to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Add half the butter, and knead until fully incorporated. The dough will be very wet and sticky (having a dough scraper is very useful), and you will need to refrigerate it for an hour before kneading in half the remaining butter. Chill again, then knead in the third and final lot of butter. If at any point the dough becomes too difficult to handle, put it in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and chill until firmer.When the butter is incorporated, place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to rest in the fridge overnight (at least eight hours). The dough won’t rise much that is normal.In the morning, remove almost half of the dough from the fridge. To make the turtle, shape most of this into a ball, slightly flattened on top. Then add a smaller ball for the head, and four more for the feet. Score the turtle’s back using a very sharp knife or razor. You can make a second turtle now, or leave the remaining dough in the fridge to use a day or two later. Any leftovers can be baked and used for dipping.Lightly cover your turtle(s) with oiled clingfilm. Leave to rise for about three to four hours at room temperature, or until two to three times the original size.Brush with egg wash and bake for 25 mins at 180C160C fan350Fgas mark 4.Leave to cool on a wire rack. Meanwhile, season the camembert and stud with garlic, then bake for 15 minutes at 160C140C fan325Fgas mark 3.Slice off the top of the turtle’s shell, and place the baked camembert inside.

Not yet married to my great‑grandmother, Sarah Pilling, he might have been dreaming of a pint in the magnificent Oak Room of the Old White Lion in Bury town centre or lounging in the summer sun in Kay Gardens a short walk away.He might, too, have longed for a small patch of land on Gigg Lane that the Earl of Derby had donated to Bury Football Club in 1885 and that was home to the 1900 and 1903 FA Cup winners. After he had emerged from the horror of the trenches, he would go on to take my dad, Graham, and my uncles to that same patch of land. In turn, my dad took me and for the past 31 years we have repeated the trek countless times.Now, if the club’s owner, Steve Dale, does not provide the English Football League with the financial information it requires by midnight on Friday, that walk we could do with our eyes shut may be snatched from us.Expulsion from the EFL would almost certainly spell the end of the club and has been brought about by catastrophic mismanagement from the last two iniduals who have held its keys.The club has not been an entirely likeable entity since 2013 when the property developer Stewart Day took over as chairman and chased his dream of Championship football. Local tradespeople went unpaid for services rendered and huge, lucrative contracts were given to players who did not deliver the goods (unlike last season’s squad, which achieved a remarkable promotion, even after it emerged they had not been paid for months).It has become virtually impossible to defend the club against its business practices, but we have to remember that the club is bigger than Day or Dale, who bought the club for £1 from Day and who is said to want a seven-figure sum for his “troubles”. The club is not these two separate men. It’s the 3,000-plus people for whom their support of the club is the defining characteristic of their lives.The effect on these people and the local community if Bury are expelled and then fold will be devastating. When Bury Football Club feels good about itself, Bury feels good about itself. We are not unique in this respect. Lots of small towns who have a member in the 72-club EFL need Jeff Stelling going crazy over last-minute winners on Soccer Saturday on Sky or their place in the classified results rundown.Bury supporters are not alone either in feeling that their fellow fans are an extension of their families. Walking to Gigg Lane at 2.45pm on a Saturday and conducting a postmortem of the game in the social club afterwards is about community. It is about being on nodding terms with a thousand different people who, when you see them in the supermarket on a rainy Thursday night, you raise your eyebrows to them in recognition of shared experiences in a gesture that says: “Great goal on Saturday, wasn’t it?”I feel like I’m a member of a secret society that I was welcomed into when I was seven years old. Supporters have invited those who sit around them at games to their weddings. We grieve when they die. My friend Barry died in 2015 and his ashes were interred on the pitch in front of the Cemetery End. When I posted about his death on a message board, I said: “You may not know his name, but he was the bloke in the South Stand who wore the big Russian hat.” From that simple description, the tributes to a fellow Shaker flowed.Fans know people at the club such as the former social club steward Ian Fitzsimmons, commercial office manager Lynne Kent and her mother, Joan, whose father played for the club in the 1930s and is Bury’s most-capped player. Joan is 80 and was still employed by the club last season. She’s watched me personally grow from a snot-nosed kid to a 38-year-old author of two books about Bury teams.Before the 1892 Lancashire Cup final, the chairman, JT Ingham, said: “We will shake them, in fact we are the Shakers,” and thus gave the club the greatest nickname in the Football League.The EFL, Day and Dale might not be shaken by the death of the club by a thousand cuts, but a small and proud town will be, along with thousands of descendants of people like Thomas Watts.James Bentley is a lifelong Bury fan and author of Things Can Only Get Better: Bury’s mid-90s rise under Stan Ternent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59816e371f1c253fdeecdc16afb22cdda906498f/0_123_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4f7b419a3e82ae3ef47fae8c87a00e","title":"major milestone africa on brink of eliminating polio","story":"Nigeria marks three years without a wild polio case, meaning Africa could be declared free of the disease in 2020Africa is on the verge of being declared polio free, after three years without any recorded cases of the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Nigeria marked three years without a wild polio case on Wednesday, a “major milestone”. If no more incidences emerge in the next few months, Africa could officially be declared polio free in 2020. The last case was recorded in Borno state in August 2016.Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: “We are confident that soon we will be trumpeting the certification that countries have, once and for all, kicked polio out of Africa.”She added that stopping the disease has not been easy and praised the “monumental effort” of health workers “on an unprecedented scale”. She said exhaustive surveillance of people on the move was a significant factor in the progress.In 2012, 200 children in Nigeria were affected by polio, which can cause paralysis and life-long health complications. The number made up more than half of all global cases.Those affected were particularly concentrated in the north-east of the country, where Boko Haram activity had made consistent access for health workers difficult. The group now controls far less territory.Renewed political commitment was evident from 2015 when President Buhari was shown personally giving one of his grandchildren vaccine drops, declaring that his administration would do “all within its powers to ensure that no Nigerian child is ever infected with polio again”. Nigeria and neighbouring countries have held multiple vaccination campaigns in locations from markets to border points to boost the immunity of the local population and prevent the virus spreading. Dr Pascal Mkanda, head of polio for WHO Africa, highlighted the increased use of technology to gather accurate data on whether the target population was really being reached.Nigeria’s progress on polio has not been without setbacks. Having reduced cases to 202 in 2002, there was a spike of 1,122 by 2006 when immunisation campaigns in the north of the country had to be suspended following unfounded rumours about the safety of the oral polio vaccine. Having redoubled its campaign, progress against the disease was again threatened by insecurity in the north-east.While WHO experts celebrated the achievements of the past three years, they underlined that political will and funding will need to be sustained, and all children under five protected. Moeti called on member states to sustain their vigilance in surveillance to maintain their wild-polio-free status.To reach full polio-free certification, a team of independent experts have to assess surveillance systems across the continent, ensuring no cases are missed and there are no gaps in monitoring.Despite the progress in halting outbreaks of wild poliovirus, several countries on the continent are still contending with the rarer vaccine-derived polio virus, which can occur in communities without full immunisation coverage.

After working as a barrister, he became a high court judge and served on the supreme court for several years.His recollections, A Judge’s Journey, highlights the sometimes awkward relationship between judges and senior politicians as they mingle socially and cooperate in administering what has become a severely underfunded justice system.Dyson’s period in high judicial office coincided with the coalition government’s imposition of austerity. He was sworn in as master of the rolls in October 2012 on the same day Grayling, then justice secretary, took his oath as lord chancellor.Grayling, he recounted, felt strongly there were too many judicial review cases funded by legal aid and that public authorities were spending too much time defending them. “In the end, I was able to persuade him water down some of his proposals, but not by much,” Dyson added.Michael Gove, who succeeded Grayling, was, by contrast, “very quick to get the point” and “genuinely believed that it was important for the rule of law to have a strong independent bar”.Gove was replaced soon, however, by Truss, who is now the trade secretary. She notoriously failed to defend senior judges when the Daily Mail in 2016 called those who ruled on the article 50 Brexit case “enemies of the people”.Truss, Dyson suggested, “was more concerned to avoid upsetting the media than to perform her statutory duty of protecting the independence of the judiciary”. Her time as justice secretary “was to prove disastrous”.Dyson calls it “highly regrettable” that the government regards “the office of lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice as being relatively unimportant. Sadly there are few votes in justice.”As a supreme court justice, Dyson was invited every year to the Royal Tea Tent at a Buckingham Palace garden party. He recounts a “long conversation” with Theresa May, then home secretary, who “wanted to talk about legal challenges to some of her decisions”. She had an impressive grasp of the issues and was “very charming”.Dyson records the Queen telling “an admiring group of guests ... that on one occasion when it was raining, she allowed some people who were not Royal Tent guests to come into the tent to shelter from the rain. She told us that, when they had left, some of the gold-plated teaspoons had disappeared. ‘Rather disappointing,’ she said.”At another dinner in 2012, to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, Dyson sat next to Hammond, then defence secretary, who was critical of a supreme court decision that the Ministry of Defence could be sued for providing soldiers with inadequate equipment.Hammond insisted that the judgment showed “a complete lack of understanding of the practicalities and difficulties facing the military”, Dyson writes. “He offered to meet me in order to educate me and explain why the decision was so bad. I did not take up the offer.”One of the dangers of being a judge, Dyson says, is of “becoming desensitised by excessive exposure to the same kinds of case, such as applications for permission to appeal by litigants in person”, especially in immigration and family law.The atmosphere in the supreme court, he said, was intense. “At the beginning I was rather lonely and felt under pressure to perform well.” He worried about being judged by “clever colleagues”. He had the “impression that at least some of them wrote judgments to impress each other and to win over colleagues to their point of view. I may have been guilty of this myself.”Dyson, whose family originally came from eastern Europe, says that being Jewish has always been important to him – “a core part of my identity”. He “hardly ever” encountered antisemitism himself but was on the “security rota” to provide protection at his synagogue.Antisemitism, he warns, has become “more overt and widespread”. The accusation that “Israel is an apartheid state is grotesque”. Those on the left are particularly prone to subjecting Israel to double standards when comparing human rights records, he writes.Dyson, who describes himself as “strongly opposed to Brexit”, records his disappointment at not being promoted to the House of Lords. David Cameron, he said, had “cleared the way” for a peerage but “May had other ideas”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bbcba53cc0e004e4840484c7d1f306c0bd467a2/0_255_5097_3059/master/5097.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e1d8dd32e5e29a956f8d826148930eb4","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree. You are absolutely right. The problems of the UK run far deeper than Brexit. The thing is, the country did vote for Brexit. Millions of people who will suffer the consequences of Brexit voted for it. People whose prospects are so poor that they voted for Brexit on the assumption that things can’t get any worse. But he also has to acknowledge the fact that we cannot go on to do that with the threat of Brexit hanging above our heads. It will make everything so much worse, and take away our ability to address the issues that are causing so much misery and poverty. Brexit will not lead to any short term or mid term increase in job or wealth creation. It will have the opposite effect for most ordinary people. Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one. It’s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2583df5ad79ddb7c935ff72e8919bfe3afca7213/0_138_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed8ca74ac7a390a6c744b08e2c42880","title":"brexit no deal funding too little too late says portsmouth council leader","story":"Labour says level of support is a ‘woeful drop in the ocean’ compared with sums spentThe government’s plans to give councils an extra £9m in additional funding for no-deal preparations have been criticised as “too little, too late” and “a drop in the ocean”, with the leader of Portsmouth council leader saying the city had spent £4m preparing for potentially thousands more lorries to use the port.The shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne, said: “‘Too little too late’ doesn’t even begin to describe the government’s woeful level of support for councils’ no-deal preparations. The £9m promised last night to some coastal councils is a drop in the ocean when compared to the amount that councils across the country have already had to spend.“Beyond ports, so many of the vital services that our local authorities provide are put at risk by the government’s pursuit of a reckless no-deal Brexit and they have simply not received the support they need.“All of this takes place against a backdrop of nine years of savage cuts to local government funding. Councils are already at breaking point and this additional spending means even less money is available to spend on vital services such as adult social care, road maintenance or environmental protection.”Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth council, said it had only been refunded £350,000 of its spending on no-deal preparations. The council has been advised that a two-minute delay in vehicles clearing in to the port could mean 60 extra lorries queueing on to the motorway.“The government has been happy to give money to ferry companies that have no ferries, that was £20m, but they have not helped local authorities get ready and we have had to plan to make sure if there is a no-deal Brexit that the whole of the M27 doesn’t grind to a halt because of queues of lorries trying to get into the port who can’t get in,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.Liberal Democrats:\u0026nbspTheir first choice would be legislation to extend article 50 then call a second referendum. If this did not work the party would support the no-confidence motion, but rather than installing Corbyn, the Lib Dems would seek a cross-party government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. It is not clear if the party would try to block a temporary Corbyn government.SNP:\u0026nbspThe Scottish National party supports a no-confidence motion. They have said they will talk to Corbyn about his plan, despite their differences over\u0026nbspBrexit. The party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has criticised Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u0027s stance.Plaid Cymru:\u0026nbspLiz Saville Roberts, Westminster leader for the party, has indicated she could back the Corbyn plan, but would prefer an immediate second referendum rather than general election.Independent Group for ChangeIndependents: The group formerly known as the TIGers, now split and reduced in number after two joined the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats, seem wary of the Corbyn plan, with some MPs saying they could not support him.Greens: Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP has taken a similar view to Saville Roberts, and has also appealed to Swinson to reconsider backing a temporary Corbyn-led government.Rebel Tories: Conservative party MP Guto Bebb has said that even a Corbyn government would be preferable to no deal. But it seems hard to see many other Tories following him.Former\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspindependents: Ian Austin, a long-time Corbyn foe, has already ruled out supporting his plan for a temporary government, and it is hard to see MPs such as Frank Field, John Woodcock, and others, doing so either.Vernon-Jackson said preparations, including triage points and lorry parks, had cost the council millions. “We’ve been out and spent the money anyway. We can’t allow government inaction and inefficiency to crucify Portsmouth,” he said.Asked if the logjam could be averted, he said: “We hope so, but we don’t know. We do 500 lorries a day. Dover dwarfs us, they do 10,000, but we’ve been told to expect up to 2,000 extra lorries a day turning up in Portsmouth because they can’t get through Dover.”On a visit to Holyhead in North Wales on Wednesday, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal Brexit planning, said predictions of a three-month “meltdown” at ports contained in leaked Operation Yellowhammer documents represented a worst-case scenario.“I’m confident that, if we all do the right thing, on 31 October we will be able to ensure that goods can flow in and out of ports like Holyhead without any significant delay,” he said. “There are a number of scenarios, there is a worst case and we are trying very hard to reduce the risk of that worst case materialising.“I think the steps that we’ve taken over the course of the last three weeks and more steps that we’ll be taking in the next few weeks and months will ensure that we reduce the risk even further. One of them is making sure that traders have all the information and the systems that they need in order to be able to export.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced overnight that it would allocate £9m to councils to help ensure they are staffed to deal with any issues at ports. Calais alone has spent £20m on no-deal contingency planning, but the ministry says it has already spent significant sums on council’s no-deal preparations.It said £5m would be split between local authorities which either have or are near a major air, land or sea port, of which Kent council would receive £2.6m because of the pressures on the port of Dover. The other £4m is set to be spent on “local resilience forums” across England, which are supporting Brexit preparations for public services. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the funds would “help local areas get ready for Brexit, whatever the circumstances” and that the ministry had “stepped up our preparedness significantly in recent weeks, including by asking every council to appoint a Brexit lead officer”.Jenrick said Portsmouth city council would be getting an additional £286,000, well short of the £4m spent by the council. The sum was “purely for staff, communications and planning”, he said.Jenrick also defended the amount announced on Wednesday. “We’ve been giving significant amounts of money to local authorities,” he said. “With the money we’re announcing … we’ll have given £77m to local authorities across the country to prepare for our departure,” he told the Today programme.“This is not money for hard infrastructure, that could come from the chancellor’s additional £2.1bn he’s announced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ada13fe7dc0bc2aacb3a6abddd969b53ca0aa0/0_561_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c8b96b4ef10a77c71db40b15ed1093c","title":"bitter leaves tobaccos devastating global legacy","story":"A new book by Rocco Rorandelli, Bitter Leaves, explores the environmental, health and social impacts of the tobacco cycle, from seed to saleby Photographs by Rocco Rorandelli and text by Judith Mackay“With a long history of denying the health risks of smoking and second-hand smoke, obscuring the truth about tobacco and deceiving smokers, the tobacco industry has evolved into an inordinately lucrative business,” writes Judith Mackay, in the abridged afterword to Bitter Leaves.“A crop that can be grown in any warm, damp environment, tobacco can be farmed on all the continents except Antarctica. With this accessibility among other forces, the industry is one of the most powerful on earth.“Smoking tobacco is the most well-known cause of lung cancer and other diseases such as heart disease, stroke and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The supply side of the tobacco industry is also the cause of a slew of other reparations including extreme poverty, dependency and diseases of tobacco farmers child labour deforestation.

Being sedentary, for instance, by sitting for long periods of time, has been linked to an increased risk of developing many conditions, including heart disease, as well as an early death.The latest study backs up previous research suggesting that reducing time spent sedentary and replacing it even with light movement is beneficial. It says higher levels of any physical activity help ward off an early grave.However, the study finds that there is more “bang for your buck” if you engage in intense activity compared with light activity. A short stint of intense activity is viewed as beneficial as much longer periods of lesser activity.Emmanuel Stamatakis, professor of physical activity, lifestyle and population health at the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study, said movement should be re-engineered into our daily lives.“People could seek to add more physical activity of any intensity to their daily routines when their circumstances and surroundings allow. But the onus is more on governments to put forward policies that will enable and empower people to move more as part of their daily routines,” he said, noting that this could include building infrastructure to promote walking and cycling.Published in the BMJ, the latest research involved a review of eight studies encompassing a total of more than 36,000 people with an average age of almost 63 years. Participants were followed for about five to six years 2,149 deaths were recorded.Crucially, all the studies involved monitoring the physical activity of iniduals who had activity trackers, and the studies did not rely on self-reporting, which, the experts noted, could be unreliable.For each study, participants were split into four equal-sized groups, based on the total amount of time spent active, and the risk of death assessed, taking into account factors such as age, sex, body-mass index, and socioeconomic status. This was then repeated for an amount of activity at different levels of intensity. The results were analysed together to give an overview.The team found a greater volume of activity overall was linked to a lower risk of death. The results held for different intensities of activity.The team said the study supported the message “sit less and move more and more often”.However, the study had limitations. It only looked at the situation for middle age and older adults, most of whom lived in the US or Europe, and some of the effect could be due to those people with a higher risk of death being less likely to engage in physical activity. Physical activity levels also were only measured over one period of time.Gavin Sandercock, of the University of Essex, said the results suggested moving more brought bigger benefits than simply reducing sedentary time, another factor measured in the study. “This study reinforces the important message that getting the least active people to do even just a little bit more physical activity can have have important public health benefits,” he said.

It took the help of a psychologist to ensure he opened up about subsequent fitness problems.Tuilagi’s revelation is alarming but he is not the first England regular to highlight how players hide injuries. Last year, Billy Vunipola claimed he has done so at least 10 times and that rugby union was “almost in NFL territory” as regards fitness problems being kept quiet for fear of losing contracts.At the start of the 2014-15 season Tuilagi’s injury list was long enough but hiding a pulled adductor muscle until “there was a loud pop” against Ulster set in motion years of fitness problems for the centre.It is widely accepted Tuilagi missed the 2015 World Cup after admitting to assaulting two police officers but he would not have been selected because of his groin injury. Hamstring and knee problems followed his return before his groin flared again in 2017 and it took until February this year for Tuilagi to make his first England start since 2014.“It was stupid,” he said. “It was the start of the season in 2014. I did it on the Thursday, played on the Saturday and strapped it up. It went higher and higher into my groin. At one stage I started strapping my pubis. The physio was like: ‘What are you doing?’ I said: ‘Er, nothing’. In the fifth game I got the ball in the first 20 minutes, went to accelerate and bang, there was a loud pop and I just couldn’t walk. I had pretty much dislocated my pubic bone.“I guess I wasn’t honest with the physios, but also I didn’t really know what it was. I didn’t tell them. I would say: ‘It is a bit sore.’ It got to that point where you are running and trying to just take the pain. I used to put a padding around my pubis, trying to keep it together.”Tuilagi is now injury-free and set to feature in his ninth consecutive England Test against Ireland on Saturday, eight years after announcing himself on to the international stage with a blockbusting performance in Dublin on his second cap, also in a World Cup warmup match, effectively booking his place at the 2011 tournament.Asked what advice he might have now for his younger self, Tuilagi said: “To look after your body a bit more and listen to it, don’t force it, because that is how it all started for me. You just think: ‘I am never going to get injured.’ Even if it hurts you think ‘I will be all right.’ That is a lesson.”Tuilagi said he often wonders how differently his career might have panned out had he not kept his groin injury hidden. But he adopts a philosophical tone when insisting he has no regrets because “whatever happened there has got me here now”. As far as he is concerned, however, honesty is the best policy.“You don’t want to miss out on playing but then you miss out more when you don’t deal with it. It might seem worse at the time but if you do it then you can come back quicker. If you hide it three or four times, maybe longer, you are out. You can take the pain but if you physically can’t do it, not because of the pain, but because your body mechanically can’t do it.”Whether Tuilagi starts on Saturday is likely to depend if Jones pairs George Ford and Owen Farrell as England’s 10-12 axis for the first time since June 2018, having hinted at playing a more expansive game last week. Mark Wilson, Sam Underhill and Tom Curry are pressing for inclusion, while Jonny May is also in line for his first appearance of the World Cup warmup games.Meanwhile, World Rugby has hastily passed a law amendment that would have denied Wales their decisive try against England on Sunday. George North scored while England were down to 13 men, with Anthony Watson in the sin-bin, Willi Heinz off the field for a head injury assessment and Ben Youngs having not yet received permission to replace him.After Wales’s 13-6 win, which put Warren Gatland’s side top of the world rankings, Eddie Jones joked that the referee, Pascal Gauzere deserved a yellow card for allowing play to restart. In fact the relevant law stated that it was the referee’s discretion as to when to restart the match but the amendment issued on Wednesday now states that for HIAs and blood injuries, the departing player must be replaced before play resumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5199e7b2363725a5f59e37dcf14314bfe8a3f0f0/0_108_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8e3e682fe1e5f8f9dcce6a949b831f","title":"japan crystal ocean juddmonte international york ebor festival","story":"Japan’s season started with a stutter here in May but he returned to the Knavesmire to set the record straight on Wednesday by beating Crystal Ocean, the 11-10 favourite, in the Juddmonte International Stakes and establishing a strong claim to be the season’s best middle-distance three-year-old in the process. Ryan Moore did not get Japan’s nose in front until the final strides but he is still improving and bookmakers now see him as the main danger to Enable when she attempts to win the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe for an unprecedented third time at Longchamp in October.York’s most prestigious Group One event was not an obvious target for Japan when he crossed the line in fourth behind Telecaster in the Dante Stakes three months ago. It was a promising run from a horse that had suffered a slight setback over the winter but no more than that and he was a 20-1 shot for the Derby a fortnight later, with Moore aboard Aidan O’Brien’s first-string contender, Sir Dragonet, the 11-4 favourite.The stable companions’ paths have taken very different directions since Epsom. While Sir Dragonet was beaten at odds-on on his only start since Japan has reeled off three straight victories, the last two of which have come at Group One level. His possible targets now include the Irish Champion Stakes and the Breeders’ Cup meeting in November. But the Arc appears to be his primary aim and on his form with Crystal Ocean here, there should be very little between Japan and Enable at Longchamp on 6 October.There is still some distance between them in the ante-post market, however, as before her run in the Yorkshire Oaks on Thursday Enable is a 6-5 chance to become the first horse to win three Arcs. Japan, who was a 5-1 shot on Wednesday, is the same price to add Europe’s showpiece event to his CV while Crystal Ocean, still officially the best horse in the business, is 8-1 alongside Sottsass, the French Derby winner. It is 16-1 bar the four.“We always thought that he was very good, but he had a setback in the spring and we thought he wasn’t going to make the Derby. We let all the horses run in their trials, and the last one was the Dante, and we came here just in case he was going to make the Derby.“We still thought the Derby was going to come a little bit quick but he ran a super race. We’ve always thought the three-year-olds have been under-rated it’s a good crop and we’ve been very happy with them.”Tips by Greg WoodThe Irish Champion Stakes is one possible assignment before Paris while a run at the Breeders’ Cup in California in early November is likely afterwards, with the Turf looking a more plausible target than the Classic despite the International Stakes’ status as a “Win-And-You’re-In” event for the meeting’s showpiece."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a49347fd68d7b82fd2ffc18c52e98a80913c9932/700_785_4772_2863/master/4772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f7b33f6513875d1da4972e78e13108","title":"justin thomas fedex cup rory mcilroy golf","story":"It is quite a feat for a $15m prize, hiked by $5m from previous years, not to be the main topic of discussion at the Tour Championship. A switch of format, as the PGA Tour seeks a fairer and simpler conclusion to its FedEx Cup, has dominated the buildup at East Lake. A 30-man field are about to step into uncharted territory.In linking the sport’s most illustrious names to the domain of amateurs, a handicap system has been implemented. The leading points scorer in the FedEx Cup, Justin Thomas, begins the season-ending event on Thursday at 10 under par and holding a two-shot advantage over Patrick Cantlay. Five players starting out at even par complete the field.Unlike before, when the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup were separate, and complicated, entities, the winner walks off with the biggest bounty in golf.Thomas said his scenario was “weird”. “I’m just going to have to try to play another tournament and act like everyone’s starting at zero and try to shoot the lowest 72 holes,” he said. “I know if I do that then I should be OK.“We changed it because we thought it was for the better but like anything you don’t really know for a couple years where you see what happens. It could be for the better, hopefully it’s for the better. We think it would be or else we wouldn’t have changed it.”Thomas rejected the notion that the pot of gold at the end of this particular rainbow was in his thoughts. “Money has never driven me,” he said. “I hope it never will. I play to win trophies, win championships, be the best player to ever walk the planet and that’s all I play for.”Rory McIlroy, who is five shots adrift of Thomas before a ball is struck, is similarly unsure whether this innovation is altogether valid. He won $10m in the FedEx Cup’s previously volatile form, whereby a complex points table – that changed hole by hole – determined the outcome. Players could see their exact positions via leaderboards but the public struggled to comprehend the detail.“The field right now is spread by 10 shots,” McIlroy said. “That could theoretically go down to six shots by the start of the second day depending on how everyone plays. So that’s probably my favourite thing about it.“Then again, you could shoot the best score of the week and not win. If that happens to someone it’s going to be hard for them to wrap their head around.“We just had a breakfast with some of the sponsors and what I said to them was: ‘If we’re at the PGA Tour trying to do the season of championships, where it starts at the Players in March, goes through the four majors and culminates with the FedEx Cup, if the FedEx Cup really wants to have this legacy in the game like some of these other championships do, is people starting the tournament on different numbers the best way to do it?’ That’s my only thing.“I know it’s definitely a simplified version and format and people will understand it better. I think it gives more guys a chance to win this week. If you look at it just from that lens it probably is better this way.”McIlroy also said the huge prize on offer had presented him with a dilemma. “It’s definitely a thought that came into my head, how can we make ourselves more relatable to the fans?” he said. “And having $15m front and centre isn’t probably the best way to do it.“But at the same time, if you turn on Sports Center, you turn on any other shows, you’re looking at football players and baseball players, basketball players getting $150m over four years. So it’s front and centre over there and it’s guaranteed. This isn’t guaranteed for us, you’ve got to play to earn it.”McIlroy raised a smile when the question of the pace of play was put to him. The European Tour released an action plan on Monday that barely registered with its most high-profile member.“I only read the headline,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t go deeper into it. I’ve had enough of the slow-play stuff.” Join the club, Rory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f129e2c5ee0c0547f2879ffcb07bfa1d4e2366e4/0_12_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9e88b01dba6e96a752ca0f29575425a","title":"third ashes test headingley england australia cricket roy","story":"• England aim to capitalise on Steve Smith’s enforced absence • Jofra Archer to spearhead bid to square Ashes in third TestJoe Root believes England are ready to pounce on the absence of Steve Smith and heap more pressure on Australia using the fast bowler who was born for the big stage. Jofra Archer remains the name on everybody’s lips after sending down the searing 92mph short ball that struck Smith’s neck at Lord’s.The tourists have lost their talisman to delayed concussion for the vital third Test starting on Thursday at Headingley.While England’s predicament looks precarious – the 1-0 deficit with three to play means they cannot afford any slip – Root is sensing a major chance in the first Ashes fixture in a decade at his home ground.On Smith, who was dominating the series with 378 runs from three innings, Root said: “They will be huge shoes to fill. It’s very unfortunate on their part but we had the challenge with Jimmy Anderson going down injured in the first Test and had to manage without a replacement.“You get these swings within a big series like this and when you get your opportunity you’ve got to jump on it. It is a huge hole. He is a big focal point of their team and we have got to try to capitalise.“I feel we are in a really good position in the series to square it up, then put a lot of pressure on Australia. I’m fully confident we can do that. I expect us to go up a level in this match.”Asked about Archer was coping with the attention, Root replied: “He’s one of those guys who seems to be born for these occasions. Once you’ve got a super over in a World Cup final in your back pocket, it makes everything a bit easier.”The high-velocity debut from Archer, when batsmen were struck on the head or body 11 times, has certainly got them thinking and after seeing Smith’s blow a number of players on both sides are now expected to attach the optional neck protectors to their helmets.Jason Roy was struck on his protector in the nets on Tuesday and while he has passed all concussion tests since and is down to play Surrey’s Ollie Pope – fresh from a double-century against Hampshire – will be on standby in Leeds just in case.Roy will undergo a final checkup on Thursday morning but were he to be named in the XI and then report delayed symptoms mid-match, a concussion substitute like the one afforded to Smith would not be allowed.Root reflected how blows such as Smith’s might affect a batsman, saying: “The thing that hurts the most is your ego. You’re stood out there in front of 35,000 people and some has mugged you off a bit – that’s how it feels when I’ve been hit.“You pride yourself on being able to either get out of the way or take it on and you make sure, first and foremost, you stay in and keep batting. I’ve never had a blow as serious as that, so it’s hard to comment on Steve’s case. But you could see the concern on the guys out in the field.”Provided Roy is passed fit, Root is expected to name an unchanged side even if he was coy on the eve of the Test. Sam Curran does offer a left‑arm angle and potential swing but the captain leaned towards the under-bowled Chris Woakes when saying: “He certainly has the ability to exploit the conditions.”Overall, Root said he expects the bowlers to dovetail Archer’s thunderous approach from the other end. Stuart Broad, the newcomer’s senior by 128 caps, was described as “enjoying the fact Jofra is getting quite a lot of the headlines” despite the fact Broad has 10 wickets.Marnus Labuschagne, Smith’s concussion replacement at Lord’s, is likely to be one of two changes for Australia, with Peter Siddle down for a rest and James Pattinson the favourite to come off the bench ahead of Mitchell Starc.Labuschagne was struck on the grille by Archer but the Australia captain, Tim Paine, while calling the 24-year-old’s impact as great for Test cricket, also looked to attribute his side’s struggles to the pitch. All eyes then on a strip that looked to have a decent covering of grass 24 hours before the toss.On how the two batsmen knocked down by Archer will respond, Paine said: “Steve loves batting, I don’t think that’s going to change. Marnus is strange, he seems to enjoy getting hit on the head, so he’s a different kettle of fish altogether."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232c443ebc0db575dfeb7551e0108b55a0f3cf6a/0_1471_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c15b695deafac817ab7669791840194","title":"jayde adams the ballad of kylie jenners old face review a pop at pop feminism","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghThe Bristolian standup’s blunt good sense is deployed to optimal effect in taking fashionable feminism in the Instagram age to taskAfter several shows in which showbiz and song featured as prominently as standup, Jayde Adams doesn’t think she’s being taken seriously enough as a comedian. This year’s offering sets out to fix that. Having not read a book in seven years, Adams has been boning up on feminism. The glam couture has been swapped for a black turtleneck, uniform of the earnest. The Bristolian is not impressed by fourth-wave feminism – or by how Beyoncé and the Kardashians represent it – and is here to take it to task.The Ballad of Kylie Jenner’s Old Face – good title – is certainly a departure from her previous work, if not the great leap forward some have perceived. (The pop it takes at Beyoncé’s feminism is reheated from previous shows.) Adams pours cold water on the progressive claims made for pop culture icons, arguing they conceal the more radical work being done elsewhere. Perhaps – just perhaps – Jay-Z grabbing his wife’s backside onstage isn’t really advancing the gender equality cause, while Adams posits a very droll analogy for the attractive actor Jameela Jamil writing a book about body positivity.Her blunt good sense is deployed to optimal effect in these sections, as she highlights the contradictions in our Instagram era between what we see and what we’re told we see. But there are contradictions at play here, too. One routine recounts Adams’s experience of online harassment after she disses a member of the band Little Mix on social media. But in a show purportedly about compassion, her offending tweet isn’t a glowing example of compassion itself.The bigger problem, though, is that her inquiry into feminism doesn’t reach much of a conclusion. “I think I’ve made my point,” she says at the end, but – having told us her show is about confidence (largely to justify a tangential anecdote about an unpleasant Parisian dining experience), then projected the word “compassion” on her upstage screen – she hasn’t, really. I relished Adams’s takedown of fashionable pop-feminism, which is very well done. Less so the lessons she draws from it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

It is just three miles long and two miles wide, a 490-million-year-old schist and slate rock that rises out of the North Atlantic.The island is known for its views over the mountain ranges on the mainland, stretching from the Twelves Bens and Maamturks of Connemara, north to Clare Island, Achill and the Nephins for its secluded beaches such as Tranaun and Curran and its colonies of cliff-nesting fulmars and auks, as well as choughs, wheatears, plovers, and puffins.The economy of Inishturk is based on “a bit of farming and a bit of fishing. That’s enough to get by”, according to Pete Faherty who was born on the island in 1954. There are also a number of state-funded initiatives to stimulate the rural economy, including environmental maintenance and staffing for Inishturk community club. Former island nurse Helen says: ‘‘It’s a slower pace, but it’s labour intensive so your day is filled.” Her husband Jack was born on the mainland and was rowed out to the island as a newborn 70 years ago.The island has been inhabited on and off since 4000BC, and permanently since around 1700. Local historian Paddy O’Toole recently told Roads \u0026amp Kingdoms magazine that “600 people lived here before the Great Famine but from 1841 to 1851 more than 400 died or left the island, many fleeing Ireland. The population never recovered.” Today there are 54 permanent residents. There is concern among the islanders, however, that essential services may be at risk if the population continues to decline.Eamon Heanue, a farmer, fisherman and father of three young children, says: “The kind of pattern that has been happening here is when your kids get to secondary school age they have to go across to the mainland … and they are kind of gone from you then after that age. The primary school has low numbers now. There have been three children, but I believe those three are going to be leaving after the summer. If they close the school will they reopen it again in a couple of years time? I don’t know.”In an effort to develop more opportunities and income on the island, which may encourage more families to settle, the islanders are looking to tourism. Phylomena Heaney runs one of the island’s three B\u0026ampBs, Tranaun House, as well as opening the island’s post office for two afternoons a week.James has been bringing two boat loads of people to and from the island seven days a week for the last four years. The ferry represents the only regular link to the mainland, and the crossing takes an hour. Before it started operating in 1997, people had to make the journey in fishing boats.Though they embrace tourism, the islanders are careful to protect their culture and identity. According to resident Bernard Heaney: “People come to an island to see an island. Turk is nice because not everybody is in tourism, they are in fishing and farming and doing their own thing. Some busier islands can feel like an extension of the mainland. Most people come to our island because they want to talk to the locals.”However, for one weekend of the year, the population grows fivefold, when the island throws open its doors to 200 young revellers. Turkfest, held over the second weekend in June since 2013 (but now every other year from 2017), is “an exploration of craic and island adventure” with a core aim of highlighting one of Ireland’s most resilient island communities, according to its organisers Fionn Kidney, Aoife McElwain and Conor Wilson.The island is transformed into a natural theatre that plays host to beach barbecues, lobster pot stages, and music venues. The Inishturk community club, which is the social hub of the island year round, extends its hospitality to the guests, and a “glampsite” of 12 bell tents is set up by the islanders on one of the few areas of flat land.The islanders assemble stages and catch fish and lobsters to feed the visitors, as well as helping to lay on extra ferries. “Everybody pulls together and gets it done. That exchange and the support from the islanders is integral to Turkfest,” says volunteer Daithi. Islanders and guests alike “put the headphones on and go mad”, according to islander Jack during the silent disco which forms one part of the broad musical programme.Turkfesters also learn skills, such as how to catch and prepare fish. Other events see festivalgoers making the most of the island’s dark skies with guided tours of the cosmos.Coming mostly from Dublin, Cork and London, the festivalgoers bring with them aspects of their urban lives that are otherwise not readily available on the island, such as primal scream yoga, fermentation classes and tap-dancing. “It could be a clash of cultures but it’s more a meeting of minds” says Emma, a returning guest from London. Many guests have returned every year since the first festival and have formed ongoing relationships with the islanders.A highlight of the weekend’s festivities is the GAA football match, which takes place on a pitch laid out in a natural arena of rocky hills. Islanders compete against the “blow-ins” in a game that is competitive but cordial.This year’s match was won by the blow-ins but only after the odds had been sufficiently stacked against the residents by loading the field with almost twice as many players on the visiting team. “The island lads and the Turkfest crew all mixing together and having a bit of fun – it’s great,” says Robert, who lives on the island and is responsible for purifying the drinking water.Turkfest comes to a close on the Sunday evening with the spectacle of road boules. Two teams comprised of a mix of islanders and visitors compete to see which can throw a boule around the distance of the island’s only road in the fewest possible throws. Islander Brendon O’Toole says ‘‘Turkfest is brilliant. It’s a long winter and you can see here how happy the locals are to have these people here.” Turkfester James says: ‘‘The islanders are not only hosting us, they’re also the life and soul of the party.”The festivalgoers are part a growing trend of respectful tourism that seeks to leave no trace that that they were ever on the island. This philosophy ensures there is mutual appreciation between the partygoers and the residents. Eamon says that after the guests leave, “the island is exactly as it was … as if nothing has happened.”Though the island faces difficulties in terms of sustaining its population, the islanders continue to believe that “tourism gives a chance for other people to come, as well as creating jobs to keep people here”.Stephen Young, who works remotely as a graphic designer, says of his experience moving to the island with his wife Maggie from Bath in 2015: “Inishturk is a small community with a big heart, you will find no better welcome anywhere.”With a steady flow of Woofers, foreign nationals and seasonal workers, there are reasons to believe that this beautiful island will continue to provide a home to people for generations to come. For now though, the islanders need a chance to recuperate. Mary Anne O’Toole, who hosts Turkfesters, says “after the storm, there is a calm – and a big one”.• The next Turkfest is in June 2021. Tickets cost €135 to non-islanders, which includes access to music, classes and workshops other activities cost extra.

It was as painfully inevitable as a dutiful cop being shot in the head on his last assignment before retirement. But like all football fans, Leeds supporters are suckers for punishment. They will relive this misery and pay for the privilege of doing so. In fact, they will look forward to the prospect – Leeds Twitter has been abuzz with talk of a new Amazon documentary series about their glorious failure for several months.And really, why not? Take Us Home tells a brilliant story, full of the cliches that somehow resonate in the context of sport. A sleeping giant of a football club with a glorious past and a tragicomic present is reawakened by a mysterious guru. He turns journeymen into thoroughbreds. He gets the club – and the city – believing in itself again. Redemption beckons. But increasingly, there is a sense that this renaissance is brittle, fragile, running on fumes. And heartbreakingly, this proves to be the case.Leeds’ wonderful Argentinian manager Marcelo Bielsa is a shadowy, elusive presence in Take Us Home, as if his impossible gravitas makes him too potent to process in large doses. After all, this is a man who, in January this year, was accused of spying on opponents and, in response, managed to turn an hours-long PowerPoint presentation into the mother of all mic drops. Rather than lengthy interviews, Bielsa’s gnomic pronouncements are subtitled onscreen. Here he is, for example, on Leeds’ burly, earnest skipper Liam Cooper: “He helps other people and is humble enough to accept help.” Now that is the kind of acute and empathetic interpersonal assessment you rarely get from “Big” Sam Allardyce.Leeds’ owner, however, is far from camera-shy. Andrea Radrizzani made his fortune trading in sports TV rights. There is an underlying shrewdness to him allowing his club to be opened up to this scrutiny. For Radrizzani, Take Us Home presumably represents a triumph of ersification, brand establishment and synergy. And he is not the first sports magnate to feel this way. Increasingly, the sprawl of small-screen streaming options has left ample room for enterprises such as this documentary series with niche appeal but a guaranteed and eager constituency.Amazon’s All Or Nothing strand has taken us inside football, rugby and American football outfits. Netflix’s Losers was an understated triumph, exploring the dimensions and psychology of sporting disaster via eight inidual stories, ranging from the gently amusing to the genuinely harrowing. The streaming giant’s Sunderland ’Til I Die series was a minor classic of its kind, too, capturing a football team in catastrophic freefall. There is always the sense that these shows are far from warts-and-all renderings and that the clubs have final edit approval what made the Sunderland series so compelling was the sense that it was impossible for the club to hide their many blemishes by the end of the season in question.There is already a set of directorial cliches in place for this emergent genre, too: obsessive, excessively tattooed supporters establishing shots of half-cooked burgers being flipped in catering vans aggressive men shouting “WE GO AGAIN!!” at each other. You can rely on hearing the assertion that the supporters of each and every club undergoing the documentary treatment have a unique level of passion and intensity. In fact, the word “passion” is foundational, a sort of holy writ.Still, passion is arguably the key component of any constructed drama, whether fact or fiction. The events being dramatised have to matter. Or why would anyone bother? Sport is, of course, the ultimate binge-watch. There are hours and hours of it – sport literally never ends. Each one is a self-sustaining ecosystem of ever-expanding and unspooling plot. It’s like Game of Thrones, only real and eternal. Every season there are new characters, new heroes and villains, new plot twists. Every year seeks to ramp up the intensity with ever-riper melodrama. There are narratives of agony and redemption. So in some ways, all this glut of accompanying entertainment does is make tangible something that has been latent for years. Sport is a permanently self-renewing drama serial with a vast captive audience.And the other thing with sport is that hope springs eternal. It is always changing, but it is always the same, too. There is always next week, next year. Myths accumulate around teams every failure and injustice is grist to the mill, making occasional triumphs sweeter. Sport in general, and football in particular, can feel like an exercise in permanently deferred gratification. Accordingly, it is the perfect subject matter for television in the streaming age. Resolution is always just around the next corner but, somehow, never quite within reach. Maybe next season? Leeds United fans certainly know that feeling ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7dd2d811ba2e3a939745ab71b30566fca6024b9/1954_284_1546_928/master/1546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f413864c461c80ff754e2b75e24ae9","title":"emmanuel macron aims to ease us iran tensions at g7 summit","story":"French president warns of ‘crisis for democracy’ ahead of Biarritz meetingThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said he will use this weekend’s G7 summit to attempt to de-escalate tensions between the US and Iran and seek to overhaul the global corporate tax code to make corporations like Google and Amazon pay more.World leaders including the US president Donald Trump, Britain’s Boris Johnson, Germany’s Angela Merkel and Japan’s Shinzō Abe will meet in the French coastal resort of Biarritz this weekend at a tense moment for international relations clouded by transatlantic rifts over trade, Iran and the climate emergency.Macron told reporters in Paris that he would meet Iranian officials ahead of the summit to make proposals to de-escalate tensions since Trump pulled the US out of Iran’s internationally brokered 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the Iranian economy.“We have made proposals either for a softening of sanctions or a compensation mechanism to enable the Iranian people to live better,” the French president told reporters, without giving more details.Macron warned of “a profound crisis for democracy in Europe and elsewhere”, saying it was up to leaders to defend and reinvent multilateralism, rethink capitalism and redefine modern democracy and “not leave it to nationalists”. He said the climate emergency was one of citizens’ biggest fears around the world and part of the growing anger at capitalism came from unfair tax systems.The French president said he would push ahead with plans to overhaul what he called the “crazy” system in which tech giants – such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple – were able to book profits in low-tax countries, no matter where revenue came from. He said they enjoyed something akin to a “permanent tax haven status”.Despite Trump’s firm opposition to increased tax on tech giants, Macron said: “The big digital players are not contributing to the common good. I don’t agree with this system, I don’t think it’s a good one, including for American workers.”Macron will also change the summit format, scrapping the tradition of signing a joint final communiqué at the end. This is in part to avoid a repeat of the fiasco last year when Trump threw Canada’s G7 summit into disarray by leaving early, scotching the final declaration.Macron said that as a former sherpa himself who had spent full nights racing to get such communiqués agreed, they were a waste of time which could be better spent developing strategy. Instead there would be what he called “useful”, informal conversations “behind closed doors” to bring leaders closer on key issues.The G7 group includes the US, France, Britain, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada, and the European Union also attends. This year Macron has also invited leaders from several other countries including India, Australia, South Africa, Senegal and Rwanda to widen the debate on inequality and climate change.Macron said “finding a solution on Ukraine” on the basis of existing peace talks was an “essential precondition” for Moscow’s return to the group.Russia was thrown out of what was the G8 in 2014 after it seized Ukraine’s Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, an annexation never recognised by the international community.Asked whether he feared the US’s Trump and UK’s Johnson siding together against others at the G7, Macron said he did not think it was Johnson’s plan after leaving the EU for the UK to simply become the “junior partner” of the US, or a vassal state. He said the UK remained close to many European capitals on foreign policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41855217fb2aed3b38a7f8f05202b3cc14f782d5/0_230_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd977a151e08f92bffbc9fd26f6bf96","title":"iran backed militia blames us and israel on bases in iraq","story":"Claim that drone strike caused blast near Baghdad follows leaked findings of Iraqi inquiryAn Iranian-backed militia in Iraq has accused the US and Israel of involvement in an alleged drone strike on a munitions warehouse near Baghdad last week, the latest in a series of mystery explosions at similar bases.The claim came after the findings of an Iraqi government inquiry into the huge blast at the facility of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) were leaked.A spokesman for the PMF said it had intelligence that showed the US had brought in four Israeli drones earlier this year to work as part of the US fleet in Iraq and target militia positions in the country.Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis said the PMF would from now on use “all means at its disposal to deter and prevent such attacks on our positions”.His comments followed another explosion on Tuesday, this time at a Shia militia base north of Baghdad which was again blamed on an aerial attack.The explosions have encouraged a wealth of competing theories as to those responsible including Israel, Islamic State militants or rival Iraqi factions.Tellingly, however, an official report leaked to the Associated Press said investigators believed the explosions at the al-Saqr military base on 12 August were the result of a drone strike. The blasts killed one civilian and wounded 28 others.The base housed weapons both for the Iraqi federal police and the PMF, which was heavily involved in the fight against Isis alongside Iraq’s official security forces.The al-Saqr incident was the fourth in a series of explosions at similar facilities in the last month. Two Iranian military engineers were allegedly killed in one blast on 19 July.That attack, on the al-Shuhada base of the PMF, was also initially blamed on a drone strike amid reported allegations that the facility had recently received a shipment of Iranian ballistic missiles.After a national security meeting last week, the Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, ordered a ban on all military flights throughout the country, unless specifically authorised by the defence ministry.Amid speculation in Israeli and Iraqi media reports that Israel may have expanded its targeting of Iranian-backed proxies from Syria to Iraq, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Monday: “Iran has no immunity, anywhere ... We will act and currently are acting against them, wherever it is necessary.”An American official, however, said the US had no evidence or credible intelligence that Israel was behind the two most recent blasts.The series of explosions, however, have exacerbated the already fraught perception in Iraq that it risks being sucked into the escalating tensions between the US and Iran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d448ad330b9585db7c86faae40f51abc1c3cb4d/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b74d596ce8245c0fb1a6c628a4a132a8","title":"top polish official resigns over alleged harassment of judges","story":"Claims emerge of attempts to discredit judges opposing government efforts to control judiciaryPoland’s deputy minister of justice has resigned and a senior official from his department was dismissed after evidence emerged of a campaign of alleged harassment, intimidation and blackmail coordinated from within the justice ministry against judges resisting government efforts to take control of the Polish judiciary.Łukasz Piebiak, who served as deputy of minister of justice with responsibility for the judiciary, resigned on Tuesday after Onet, a news portal, published alleged communications via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger with a woman identified in the Polish press only as “Emilia”.In one of the alleged exchanges, Emilia outlines a plan to discredit Krystian Markiewicz, a judge and law professor who serves as the head of Iustitia, an association of Polish judges that has been fiercely critical of attempts by the ruling rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS) to assert direct control over the appointment, promotion and discipline of all the country’s judges.The plan consisted of circulating a lurid four-page dossier of unsubstantiated allegations about Markiewicz’s private life. Responding to Emilia’s suggestion, Piebiak is alleged to have written: “I think it will help. It is important that it sweeps through Iustitia to let them know who we are dealing with. People will spread it, and Markiewicz will fade away, knowing what we have on him.”Emilia’s social media history reveals a history of abuse directed against judges who have criticised the PiS over its efforts to take control of the judiciary.The dossier, which included unsubstantiated claims about Markiewicz’s private life, was distributed to more than 2,000 people associated with Iustitia. According to the Onet report, Piebiak also gave Markiewicz’s private address to Emilia, who sent a copy of the dossier to the judge’s family home.In another alleged exchange, Piebiak and Emilia discuss a plan to share with state media details of an alleged extra-marital affair involving a judge from the Warsaw branch of Iustitia. The allegations were broadcast on state television in May last year, after which Emilia wrote to Piebiak asking whether he approved of the result. Piebiak is alleged to have replied: “Great, I am just sending it to the boss, to make him happy.”Piebiak’s reference to “the boss” has raised questions as to whether Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland’s justice minister, was aware of Piebiak’s activities.Piebiak, a regional judge, played a leading role in the PiS campaign to assume control of the judiciary, through the passage of legislation giving Ziobro the power to dismiss court presidents, and the appointment to key positions of pro-government judges with close professional and personal links to the justice ministry.“He was an insider. As a judge he knows our weakness, our vulnerabilities. He knew where to find unhappy people,” said Jaroslaw Gwizdak, a former court president in the south-western region of Silesia who opted to leave the profession rather than serve as a judge under the new regime.“They find judges with disciplinary problems, judges whose careers are going nowhere, people with no integrity, and offer them the chance to leapfrog everybody else, by giving them jobs in the ministry and by appointing them to the country’s top courts,” Gwizdak added.Polish judges who have resisted the government have long complained of a campaign of intimidation that they allege is closely coordinated between the justice ministry, state prosecutors, government-controlled media and anonymous social media accounts.“They’re trying to break me and they are winning. I’m tired, I want to live in peace. They have the power of the whole state behind them and I’m alone,” Wojciech Łączewski, a district court judge in Warsaw, told the  last year.Emilia, the woman at the centre of the scandal, is understood to be the former wife of a pro-government judge with close ties to the justice ministry.In an emotional statement published on Wednesday by the liberal broadsheet Gazeta Wyborcza, she described herself as having been “cheated and exploited”, claiming that a group of judges and officials within the ministry had passed her the compromising information and encouraged her to believe that she was doing her patriotic duty in helping to rid the country of what government propaganda routinely denounces as a “privileged caste” of “thieves in robes”.“All that hate,” she wrote, “I did it for Poland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Research Lives: Dr Diarmuid Torney, DCU assistant professor in environmental politicsFigures show 257 cases recorded last year \u0026ndash the highest number since records began in 2010Clouds appear over 78th annual Cavan show as farmers struggle to predict political futureShirley Moran Breslin diagnosis took more than four years after being bitten by a tickLocal authority consulting with HSE about wording of the signsOne sex offender living with son (14) in the care of the State, internal emails showImporters and exporters urged to get supply chains ready for \u0026lsquodifficult period ahead\u0026rsquoExperts believe incidence of Lyme disease may be much higher than estimatedScientists and doctors unite in call to act on climate change to protect human healthUCC academic Amanullah De Sondy says caller told him: \u0026lsquoI hope you are executed\u0026rsquoCalls for politicians to set up fund for protection of churches, mosques and synagoguesVast majority of designated habitats in Ireland are in poor condition, EU hearsWin is 15th biggest in game\u0026rsquos history and follows jackpot roll-overs since June 12thPaul Casey and Robert O\u0026rsquoLeary arrested in connection with car bomb under PSNI carErosion of trust in society is a threat to food safety, says European food authorityMinister for Health makes unannounced visit as 76 patients lie on trolleys at UHLEU commissioner says failure to reach an agreement will create a \u0026lsquofoul atmosphere\u0026rsquoReview of south Dublin services found Tusla lacks \u0026lsquoconcrete plan to address risk in a timely way\u0026rsquoSt Aidan\u0026rsquos National School in Bawnboy needs three more pupils to retain third teacherJudge rules against Paul McIntyre (51) amid claims of witness intimidation in Derry"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3993379.1566421388!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bovine talk turns to brexit and boris in virginia as cliff edges closer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRebecca Windrum and Alesha McAloon with their goats Millie \u0026 Minnie at the Virginia Agricultural Show in Cavan on Wednesday afternoon.

None of those “fancy ‘AI’ bulls”, he said.Local TD and Minister for Business Heather Humphreys, who awarded the prize, was not too put out that a cow from Dublin was taking the prize out of her home constituency.“The best cow won,” she conceded.The winner, named Baldonnel Flashmatic Dawn, produces 14 gallons of milk a day, Dowling boasted.After BrexitIt was what will happen to this produce after Brexit at the end of October that had many farmers talking at the Co Cavan show.“There is a little cloud on the horizon,” said Dowling. “Anyone could see that any form of borders or tariffs, or anything, especially in the delicate times we are in with beef and milk prices, is a worry.”Milk processors were equally concerned at the new type of brinkmanship being played by the new British prime minister Boris Johnson as he appears willing to risk a no-deal Brexit.“It is coming very close to the cliff now,” said Martin Keane, the chairman of dairy processor Glanbia Ireland, one of the sponsors of the dairy cow breeding competition.Some 30 per cent of the milk processed at Glanbia’s local plant in Virginia comes from Northern Irish cows which, in the event of a crash-out Brexit, will require approval from EU food health inspectors.Keane said he was “very concerned” about what might happen over the coming weeks.“Clearly Boris has a strategy that is different from his predecessor. We don’t know where this is going to land,” he said.Cavan man Joe Brady, a candidate to be the next Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) president, said there was much frustration “on the ground” at the show over Brexit and whether the Government was doing enough to prepare.‘Doomsday’“For an ordinary farmer on the ground, he probably sees nothing happening and thinks that Doomsday is very close. Hopefully that is not the case, that there is a plan that will be put in place that will kick in in the worst-case scenario,” he said.As for the agreement reached between beef farmers and the meat-processing industry in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Brady said that it “doesn’t go near far enough”.Brexit wasn’t just concerning farmers.Helen Craig, who had travelled across the Border from Co Down to sell her preserves and pickles at a stall, said she was concerned about what the UK’s exit would mean for small businesses like hers.“I’m pickling a lot more to prepare for Brexit. It’s a good thing that preserves are long-lasting to take me over the bumpy period,” she said.Humphreys, still pushing for the proposed Brexit agreement that Johnson wants scrapped, showed a flash of frustration at when Boris would produce his Plan B to the contentious backstop.“Where are the alternative arrangements?” she asked, telling The  there were just 69 days until Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3993347.1566421052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lucky ticket holder scoops 11m in biggest lotto win for two years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe jackpot of €11,225,280 – the highest in more than two years - had been rolling since June 12th.The Republic has its latest millionaire after one lucky winner scooped the 15th largest jackpot in Lotto history on Wednesday.The jackpot of €11,225,280 – the highest in more than two years - has been rolling since June 12th.The winning numbers were 10, 13, 23, 24, 25, and 44.

On a per capita basis, that was more than the US. Well she might crow.\u0026nbspThat’s indeed impressive.\u0026nbspBut those figures require a bit of context because while tech might be attracting foreign cash, overseas investors have been turning\u0026nbsptheir backs on the rest of UK plc.\u0026nbspMore than half of women working in tech told they’re ‘too pretty’Trump ‘tells UK US trade deal relies on dropping tax on tech giants’ Ocado’s tech gobbledygook has investors in a tizzy Figures from the Department for International Trade, published in June, show a 14 per cent slump in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u0026nbspover the 201819 financial year\u0026nbspcompared with the previous 12 months. The number of new jobs created fell at an even faster rate: they were down by 24 per cent.An analysis by the Financial Times also found that in the three years to June, the number of jobs created through UK FDI in new production facilities, or extensions of existing ones, had dropped by nearly a fifth (19 per cent) to 183,000 compared with the same period before the EU referendum.\u0026nbspThe Conservative Party used to hail Britain’s record as a hub of overseas investment and a European leader. That’s\u0026nbspbecause it was. It has systematically trashed that.\u0026nbspThere are a few reasons why tech may be bucking the marked downward trend, or rather, there are a few reasons why tech may currently be bucking the marked downward trend.For a start, the Brexit induced slump in the pound makes buying into clever UK tech projects very cheap right now. Foreign investors are, in effect, shopping for whizzy new gizmos in the bargain bin where you might normally find previous generations of mobile phones and tablets shortly after a new model’s launch.It also comes at a time when the UK (and Europe) might provide a handy hedge for Asian investors\u0026nbspwith the US and China knocking trade lumps out of each other. Asian investors like Japan’s Softbank or Singapore’s Clermont Group have been active investors in the UK tech scene.\u0026nbspTech isn’t likely to be affected by the no deal Morgan will play a role in kicking the country with as much as, say, the motor industry, with its requirement for just-in-time delivery of parts up the supply chain, or agriculture, which faces a series of ruinous new tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She was 19, a self-described “sneakerhead” with a part-time job in Footlocker and an obsession with matching her outfit with her trainers. She was also a big fan of working out at the gym, where she would do strength training and resistance, partly to prove to her brother that she could do press-ups. Wearing the hijab provided a new challenge: “I didn’t know how to do my headscarves in general, let alone at the gym!”\u0026nbspA lack of choice online led Hossen to start her own clothing brand called SH Athletics in October 2015, making modest, comfortable clothing for workouts that didn’t look completely shapeless. But it was only when she started seeing articles referring to her as an entrepreneur that Hossen realised she was one. “I thought, ‘oh, that’s what I am!’” she says. “I was just doing what needed to be done, but I think that’s how a lot of businesses start out.”\u0026nbspSince 2017, Hossen has also been Nike’s first hijab ambassador in the UK, a post invented to promote the brand’s\u0026nbspPro Hijab. This October, Hossen will take part in the Red Bull UK Academy to work with other social entrepreneurs who want to make a difference within their communities.Hossen’s\u0026nbspwork – from her day job as a personal trainer\u0026nbspto her business manufacturing sports clothes – is united by a common theme of helping others to feel confident in their pursuits. “The most common thing I hear from women is that they are afraid of being stared at,” she says. She says women too often feel like they don’t belong in a gym. “All it takes is for someone to say how long have you got left, and often, even if they’re not finished they will give it over rather than say, ‘no,’\u0026nbspbecause they feel like it’s not their piece of equipment.”When\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspfirst meets a client, often after they have approached her on Instagram, she starts with exercises that build their confidence and assert their right to train. She bases her lifting workshop in a “proper bodybuilder gym with proper rusty weights”. “I tell them if you can train in this gym you can train in any gym,” she says.Hossen starts by reassuring clients that most people in the gym are minding their own business, but she also helps them find words to stand up to people who interfere: “For people who put their nose in, it’s about developing the confidence to stand up to them and say, ‘I do know what I am doing,’ and leave it at that.”But she knows from personal experience that developing that confidence takes time.\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspstarted training at 15 as a way to blow off steam from secondary school. “It helps me to have an outlet, to have that scheduled time to move,” she says. The gym that\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspbegan training at was in a leisure centre in north London that charged the tiny concession price of £1.60 to train. But it only had a small gym with a section for resistance weights and cardio and a floor section for abs work.Nike pro hijab among ‘hottest fashion products of the year’There was also a weights room, but this was sectioned off.\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspremembers it “smelling of man”. Just like her clients before her, she decided not to go inside, choosing the resistance machines instead. “There wasn’t a thought process, but there were all the men in there, and little old me, and I’m still quite small.”Going to the gym was always about improving her strength, rather than her appearance. “I was a teenager and I wanted to get strong,” she remembers. “I didn’t realise that it wasn’t normal. I thought, if I can’t do a push-up, I can train to do a push-up – as opposed to let me grow my bum.”Even now, she rails against the idea that women should stay away from weight training because it’s not attractive to men. “There’s this whole stigma that we shouldn’t be weight training or strength training because it’s not attractive to men,” she says. “I was just doing what I wanted.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSH Athletics was founded when\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbsprealised that if she couldn’t find clothes that made her feel comfortable and confident, then other women must also be struggling. “I looked around and there was stuff in Malaysia, Turkey and Singapore, but there was nothing in Europe,” she remembers. “I thought that I probably needed a custom-made gym outfit for myself.”She got talking to a friend who had started her own clothing line: “She said that starting a sports brand is quite easy because it’s just jeggings, and then\u0026nbspyou decide what kind of material, either cotton or lycra, and the style. But with what I wanted, it had to be designed from scratch.”Hossen had a few hundred pounds saved from her part-time job.\u0026nbspWith help from a friend who had trained as a designer, she created some drawings that she paid to have made into her first line of clothes. These included training dresses, cut long in the body and with a flattering bias hem, high-waisted jogging bottoms and long-sleeved T-shirts. When the website launched in October 2015, Hossen watched excitedly as the first order came through from the US a few minutes later. “That was so cool!” she remembers.Why the makers of Wallace and Gromit decided to become employee-ownedThe communities taking on harbours, libraries, sports grounds and pubsHow a Google millionaire is creating an offline future for communitiesSH Athletics\u0026nbspis now in a research phase. Hossen plans to relaunch the brand in 2020 with new lines and fabrics. She is still self-funding the business, but thinking about crowdfunding to raise investment to take it to the next level.\u0026nbspOne of the biggest challenges of being a young designer with a low budget, she says, is finding manufacturers willing to make clothes in small batches. “The quantities I’m after are not industrial,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Because my designs are so unique, I need someone I can work with who understands. I really want a manufacturer that I can grow a relationship with and who understands my brand.”In October, Hossen will run fitness classes at the first Red Bull Academy in the UK, an event for aspiring entrepreneurs. Her best advice for entrepreneurs is something that could just as easily be applied in a workout: “Start where you are with what you have,” she says. “A lot of the time a lot of what stops us from starting is thinking that we have to\u0026nbsphave everything now, instead of making baby steps. Then reach out to see if other people can help.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They found that up until those born in the 1970s, each generation tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.“Stagnating income for more recent generations compared with their older counterparts is likely to be influenced by several factors. For instance, over recent years, wages and salaries have fared worse than their historical trends,” the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.In the 10 years since 2004, pay per head fell by on average 0.1 per cent each year, whereas in the preceding decade it rose by 3.9 per cent every year, the ONS noted.The release uses inflation-adjusted data on household incomes after taxes, including private pensions and cash benefits provided by the state.Created with Sketch.Sixties pop and films  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and film17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and filmThe results are not uniform. For example, people born in the 1990s had a higher household income at the age of 27 than those born in the 1980s did at the same point in their lives, but the reverse was true at the age of 23.But, overall, the figures point to a broader trend and confirm an observation made in the House of Lords report.“Pay progression has slowed for younger generations. They are unlikely to enjoy the same generation-on-generation income gains that their predecessors received,” it said.The ONS data also shows that tax and benefit reforms over the years have tended to benefit later generations.On average, people of all generations pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits throughout most of their working lives. Their net contribution peaks in their mid-50s when they are less likely to have school-age children and therefore use education services.But, within that overall pattern, the ONS has spotted some changes. For example, those born in the 1950s paid on average £3,000 per year more in tax than they received in benefits when they were between 25 and 34 years old. Meanwhile, those born in the 1980s paid only £1,100 per year more in taxes than they received in benefits at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Earlier this week, the private space company\u0026nbspbegan selling t-shirts on its website with the slogan Nuke Mars.The plan has proved controversial, with some scientists warning that nuclear weapons could in fact throw up giant clouds into the planet\u0027s atmosphere that block out sunlight and cause it to cool down even more.\u0026nbspA recent study published in\u0026nbspNature Astronomy\u0026nbspalso claimed that terraforming Mars is not possible using present-day technology.\u0026nbspUndeterred by these projections, Mr Musk now claims there is more than one way to warm up the Red Planet. His latest plan involves a system of giant mirrors that would orbit Mars reflecting sunlight onto its surface.Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites to warm Mars vs artificial suns, he tweeted.Created with Sketch.

But they have only confirmed two that repeat.Repeating FRBs are so valuable because they offer researchers the opportunity to predict where they might come from, and study them in more detail. As such, discovering eight more repeating bursts could provide huge value to the researchers who are attempting to find where the bursts are coming from.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The researchers suggest that one of the bursts could be coming from a galaxy that neighbours own Milky Way – though caution that further work will need to be done to discover more about the bursts.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?The new data comes from the\u0026nbspCanadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, a telescope that scientists had hoped would shed new light on FRBs. Now it has done so, with the discovery of eight more that have been described in a new paper published on Arxiv.Nobody knows where the FRBs are coming from, or what they might be. The profound intensity of the blasts suggests that they are being sent by some extreme event – but that could be anything from a star falling into a black hole to a message being sent through the cosmos by aliens.To try and understand their source, scientists have searched for more bursts and looked to understand them in better detail when they come. Repeating bursts are likely to be key to that, since they can be examined with so much more clarity.In addition to the two confirmed bursts, other researchers have reported two more that are yet to have been published in peer-reviewed journals. The new discovery therefore triples the number that have been found and could lead to much more detailed research on where they are coming from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So far, not too crazy, but then the machine gets stuck in the sky and it starts raining food. Everything goes wrong and Flint Lockwood must save the day by flying up to the machine and kicking fried chicken butt. Yeah, a pretty crazy premise, but a fantastic film.Michael Fassbender may be one of the most bankable stars of the moment - having starred in the likes of Steve Jobs, X-Men and Macbeth - but in 2014, instead of flaunting his face, producers decided to make him wear a weird papier-mâché mask for the film’s near entirety. The plot see’s Fassbender’s titular character front a rock band, play SXSW and make ‘likeable’ music. It’s all just a bit strange.Almost anything with Bill Murray in it is a win in my book, but when you say the premise of Ground Hog day out loud - a weatherman who must relive the same day over and over again - it sounds quite boring. What transpired was one of Murray’s funniest films.With Star Wars being so prevalent in pop-culture, it’s hard to imagine a time when no-one except George Lucas knew what a Lightsaber was.

While he may have chosen to reboot numerous films in the past few years (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the upcoming Dumbo 2) it was his original concepts that set him apart from everyone else. In Burton’s head, the love story of a man with scissors for hands and a young woman made complete sense, while for everyone else - from just the premise - it seemed entirely weird. Luckily, he was given the opportunity to make the film and a cult classic was born, all while Johnny Depp’s ability to play the outsider was solidified. Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn’t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke. Luckily, Chris Columbus managed to pull off the ridiculous plot (how wouldn’t the kids know it’s their father, really?) leading to one of the funniest films of the 90s.Like Burton, most of Yorgos Lanthimos’s films could probably feature on this page, but we’ve gone with The Lobster.

Earlier in the film, Trinity died in a hovercraft crash.It should be highlighted that the all-knowing Oracle\u0026nbsp(Mary Alice) tells a young girl named Sati\u0026nbsp(Tanveer K\u0026nbspAtwal) that she thinks they will see Neo again. In many ways, this moment could be considered the perfect setup for Neo\u0027s return.Quite how this happens is a mystery, but revisiting the climax of Revolutions provides food for thought. During Neo\u0027s battle with Agent Smith, the\u0026nbspleader of the Machines sends a surge of energy into his body, which causes the Neo-Smith clone to be deleted. Perhaps there was – wait for it – a glitch in the Matrix and\u0026nbspanother clone existed that didn\u0027t get\u0026nbspdestroyed?

Maybe this clone of Neo has created his own Inception-style world in which a version of Trinity exists?A possible, if extremely unlikely, theory is that Lana Wachowski will attempt to rewrite the events of sequels The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy. Sure, there are quite a few murders, but what about that beautiful Oxford setting, where dreaming spires tower above the grisliness? It\u0027s intelligent and has brilliant characterisation, with John Thaw\u0027s curmudgeonly, Wagner-loving, real-ale man its wonderful centre of gravity. The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

They found that up until those born in the 1970s, each generation tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.“Stagnating income for more recent generations compared with their older counterparts is likely to be influenced by several factors. For instance, over recent years, wages and salaries have fared worse than their historical trends,” the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.In the 10 years since 2004, pay per head fell by on average 0.1 per cent each year, whereas in the preceding decade it rose by 3.9 per cent every year, the ONS noted.The release uses inflation-adjusted data on household incomes after taxes, including private pensions and cash benefits provided by the state.Created with Sketch.Sixties pop and films  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and film17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and filmThe results are not uniform. For example, people born in the 1990s had a higher household income at the age of 27 than those born in the 1980s did at the same point in their lives, but the reverse was true at the age of 23.But, overall, the figures point to a broader trend and confirm an observation made in the House of Lords report.“Pay progression has slowed for younger generations. They are unlikely to enjoy the same generation-on-generation income gains that their predecessors received,” it said.The ONS data also shows that tax and benefit reforms over the years have tended to benefit later generations.On average, people of all generations pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits throughout most of their working lives. Their net contribution peaks in their mid-50s when they are less likely to have school-age children and therefore use education services.But, within that overall pattern, the ONS has spotted some changes. For example, those born in the 1950s paid on average £3,000 per year more in tax than they received in benefits when they were between 25 and 34 years old. Meanwhile, those born in the 1980s paid only £1,100 per year more in taxes than they received in benefits at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

But there is now no prospect of Yellowhammer’s national emergency. By Halloween, we will be ready to go.There will be no public demand for bird-spotter Ken Clarke to volunteer as caretaker PM “once I find out what the Devil’s going on”.We now have TWO Magic Grandpas! One, an endearingly dotty optimist who has lost count of the times he’s run for PM, the other a maling Marxist misfit.Andthese two old geezers need help, political harpy Hattie Harman is ready for her comeback as unwanted baggage.We must be in desperate timesthis trio, accompanied by Green MP Caroline Lucas and her All-White Women’s Unity Band, think they can stop us honouring the  referendum.As a sideshow, Oliver Letwin, who once invited burglars into his home at am, came close to a repeat offence last week by offering to help Jezza into Number .Jeremy Corbyn, for all his slippery twists and turns, is a lelong EU-hater.He worshipped at the feet of Tony Benn who fought Brussels until his dying day. Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown. It will be rebel MPs versus the democratically expressed wishes of their own voters.Boris Johnson will not resignhe loses a confidence vote. He will call a general election immediately after Britain has left the EU on October .There is talk about a challenge to the Supreme Court but judges are unlikely to intervene against a PM executing the will of the people. Only the Queen could stop him — and there’s no chance of that.Would Bercow take this clash to the bitter end, sending in troops to drag Boris out of Number Ten — and providing a springboard for a Tory election landslide It is hard to know what goes on in the heads of fanatical Remainers.Whatthey get their own way, delay Brexit and leave a humiliated UK swinging half-in, half-out of the EU, coughing up a £billion lump sum and paying £bn a year for the privilege Imagine the bomb-site political landscape after a Parliamentary lynch mob sabotages the wishes of .m voters.We would be looking at another civil war, Mr Speaker.Brussels and Remain diehards need to wake up. Britain WILL leave the EU as promised. And Boris WILL win the election immediately afterwards, almost certainly by a wide margin.Any MPs who flirt with Corbyn’s Marxists or Hammond’s subversives will be purged.They will look back from the ashes of their political careers to a Britain which has cut free and prospered in open trading waters.And they will see arrogant EU leaders steering their vaunted Grand Projet on to the rocks of broken dreams.We are bleakly accustomed to a day-by-day massacre of young lives. Knives, machetes and now motor vehicles are the murder weapons of choice. Newlywed PC Harper is simply the latest tragic victim of a fast-accelerating assault on The Thin Blue Line.I have criticised police in the past for abusing their power against politicians, journalists and celebrities.

In the meantime . . .It’s series one of Gemma Collins: Diva Forever, an off-shoot of public service broadcasting I like to call National Service broadcasting, on account of the fact I find it impossible to watch without longing for theof conscription.It’d be hard, in fact, for me to think of anyone who could possibly have less fun watching “The GC” in full flight.Fair play to ITVBe, however. They’ve not just thought of him, they’ve got the poor sod doing the voiceover.It’s only Angus Deayton, whose every word has to be extracted here with forceps and retractors, even though, truth be told, on a purely technical level it’s probably the easiest buck he’s ever earned.Cos it’s not that Diva Forever lacks a narrative, it’s just that it’s got exactly the same one every week.Gemma turns up horrendously late for an appointment. Gemma treats ious assistants like absolute dirt.Then Gemma dissolves in floods of self-pitying tears when on off boyfriend Arg does exactly the same to her.There’s a lot of eating going on here as well. And I mean A LOT.They’re like Mr and Mrs Creosote at the local curry house, which definitely isn’t a spectator sport.But it still comes as a relative relief because it means Gemma isn’t bellowing orders, over-sharing details about her nether regionsand generally carrying on in that adorably emphatic and boastful way of hers.“I’m going to sack my manager, he should pick up the phone.” “You work for one of the most famous reality stars in Britain.” “People normally pay to get this close to me.” “I wish I could clone me. Could you get DNA and make another me ”What  Like Dolly the Orca  On supply and demand grounds alone, it seems a long shot, Gemma luv.Occasionally, there are moments of high comedy as well. One arrived minutes into the first episode when she asked her musical collaboratorNaughty Boyher new single could be “heard in space”.Pause . . .“Space  Everything you say can be heard in space, Gemma.”Why’d you think the Martians never land in Brentwood High Street The rest of the time, Diva Forever is the most depressing thing on television right now. A show that offers no hope of redemption. Just more of the same.The truly crushing irony, of course, is that it’s going head-to-head with Channel ’s Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain, which is the network’s attempt to apologise for exploiting an ill-prepared and out-of-her-depth girl without any of the contributors ever coming close to apologising.They can spare us their faux regret and sly buck-passing, though.Jade Goody didn’t change Britain, she just changed television, paving the way for Charlotte Crosby, Jodie Marsh, Nikki Grahame, Gemma and a format that continues next week with “The GC” on the blower to a well-known tourist attraction.“Can you kindly tell me how I’d go about getting a waxwork of myself in Madame Tussauds ”Is it too much to expect you start with just a hint of talent Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “KP Equestrian is a clothing range by which celebrity and former glamour model ”Helen: “Kevin Pietersen.”Bradley Walsh: “How many minutes after a quarter past eight is a quarter to nine ”Kwame: “.”And Ben Shephard: “On what date is Christmas Day traditionally celebrated each year ”Tom: “Wednesday.”Not  minutes into ITV’s big new “emotional thriller” and Anna Friel’s already lost her pants in a rich neighbour’s bathroom.She’s looked in the laundry basket, under the sink and round the back of the toilet cistern, but you know how it is . . .You have sex with Adam the plastic surgeon and, next thing you know, no pants.I’m pretty sure, though, we haven’t seen the last of Anna’s undercrackers on Deep Water, a six- parter which has been sold to us as “female led” for the very obvious and woke reason ITV couldn’t possibly sell it to us as “good”, or even a “give-a-toss drama”.Cos it isn’t either of those two things.You’ll already know from that description, however, the blokes are all a bunch of weak, hopeless EastEnders cliches. Joe, who’s married to Anna’s character Lisa, is a drunken football bore who drives a cab.Winston’s a layabout with a gambling addiction and Guy’s the bloke off Monarch Of The Glen but smugger.There’s also some other creep called Scott, who’s made an indecent proposal to Anna’s debt-ridden physio mate Roz, who should bite his hand off for it, as that’s as good as it’s ever going to get for her on Deep Water.Don’t feel too sorry for any of the women, though. They’re almost as bad as the men, as are their hideous children, one of whomwent missing at the end of last week’s first episode.The police have been called, search parties scrambled, the Lake District scoured and, God willing, they’ll find Anna Friel’s pants before long.Sport reporters who say “game time” instead of games.This Morning bothering to ask: “Should all doctors wear a fat suit ” And comedian Adam Rowe, who was spewing foul-mouthed class-war hatred on the “truly anti-establishment” Tez O’Clock Show a couple of weeks ago but has now reappeared fronting the Nationwide Building Society’s new advert.Workers of the world unite.

They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers. What a conversation that must have been.“Air-miles Andy” has long been an embarrassment to the Royal Family and the country, the best possible argument for getting rid of the monarchy.He likes to travel by helicopter to events he could just as easily reach by car.He once took a £, helicopter trip from Windsor to West Sussex, which is less than an hour and a half by car. But his profligacy is just the start.His role as a “special trade representative” from  to  cost the public £million including travel and police protection. One trip to America by private jet cost £,.And he wasn’t very good at it. Wikileaks revealed the US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote of Andrew’s diplomacy: “Rude language a la British . . .  turned to the general issue of promoting British economic interests abroad.He railed at British anti-corruption investigators who had the ‘idiocy’ of almost scuttling the al-Yamamahdeal with Saudi Arabia.”Former minister Chris Bryant said of Andrew: “When I was at the Foreign Office, it was very dficult to see in whose interests he was acting.“He doesn’t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem.”He lives in luxury with his similarly profligate and foolish ex-we Sarah at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, which was renovated at a cost of £million when he moved in.His family are supported by the Queen’s income from the privy purse and the Duchy of Lancaster. In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid.

Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed. Inner contentment is the greatest anti-ageing formula there is.Don’t I know it.In Mexico, The Bloke said: “Seen one old building, seen ’em all,” as I headed off to Chichen Itza and he headed for a sun lounger.And when I once suggested a safari in Africa, he replied: “No thanks, I’ll watch it on the Discovery Channel.”I got him to come to Rome’s Colosseum once, but only because it was raining and there was a recommended restaurant right opposite.Dear reader, I married him.MICHAEL Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones have posted a charming photograph of a family lunch that includes their two teenage children, Michael’s brothers and nephews, and his once troubled son Cameron from his first marriage.Now , Cameron – who credits Catherine and Michael for sticking by him – has turned a corner and is happily married with a young daughter.Also there were Michael’s dad Kirk, , and stepmum Anne, .Proof,needed, that Hollywood royalty or not, every family has its ups and downs and all that matters as your le nears its end are the loving people that  surround  you.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Reeves is told, the sentinels are a killing machine designed for one thing: search and destroy.In reality: Terryingly, we now have the technology to make machines which can identy human targets and automatically choose to kill them.So-called lethal autonomous weapons include drones, ships and land vehicles armed with missiles and machine guns which will make up the future of warfare.China is really at the tip of the spear with these terrying war machines after unveiling its Blowfish A drone which can carry out devastating airstrikes without any human input at all.In the film: The underground refuge, Zion, is the last remaining human civilisation in the Matrix movies and its also the setting of the epic last-stand of mankind against the machines in the third film, The Matrix Revolutions.The city is explained to have been built deep in the earth near the core where theres still warmth after humans scorched the sky in a bid to cut off the solar powered machines from their energy supply during a war with them on the surface.In reality: All over the world, many people are similarly looking beneath the ground to survive in vast concrete complexesthe world were to become uninhabitable because of some catastrophe, like a war with the machines or cataclysmic climate change.In America, a property developer has bought up  disused weapons cellars to convert into the largest survival community on Earth.The project named Vivox xPoint will eventually become home to , people who buy a place in the subterranean shelter, ready for when Armageddon comes.In the film: One of the few upsides of having a direct digital port into your brain, which all characters unplugged from the matrix do, is that they can have skills digitally installed.In one scene, Neo masters Kung-Fu in seconds while sitting in a chair with his eyes closed as the file is downloaded into his head.And in another, Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, instantly learns how to fly a helicopter to stage a rescue of kidnapped Morpheus.In reality: Unbelievably, boffins have being making some astonishing steps towards real-le instant learning.In , MIT scientists managed to implant a memory from one mouse into another, effectively learning something without ever having experienced it, like knowing how solve a maze that another mouse had completed.And earlier this year a tech expert said Google brain implants in the next  years could allow us to learn anything instantly.In the film: Neo is unplugged from the matrix by Laurence Fishburnes prophetic character Morpheus, who is also the captain of the Nebuchadnezzar — a flying hovership.And although the crafts futuristic propulsion system might not be a reality yet, flight as the main kind of transportation certainly is.In reality: A vertical take-off and landingcar was successfully demonstrated in Japan recently, with the manufacturer saying itll put the drones into mass production by .And theres also a flying car racing Grand Prix set to kick off next year in an all-new high octane motorsport, pitched as a cross between F and drone racing.Even Uber has designed flying taxis, so we could all be on the lookout for squiddies in the rear-view mirror soon.In the film: An electromagnetic pulse destroys machines in The Matrix by firing a burst of electromagnetic energy at them which scrambles electronics.This is the hovercrafts only defence against sentinels — and its also a major security threat in the real world.In reality: Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to make agencies strengthen US infrastructure against a possible EMP attack.A foreign enemy could effectively destroy all electronics in a country by overloading them with a huge blast of electromagnetic energy, crippling its national grid at the same time.They could do this firstly by detonating a nuke at high altitude over the target because nuclear explosions produce an enormous electromagnetic pulse — one US test over the pacic ocean in the s caused streetlights to explode and phones to die  miles away, far out of reach of the actual blast radius.The other option is to use a high-power microwave weapon which generates a powerful and targeted electromagnetic field of microwave energy.Although this wouldnt wreak the same kind of havoc a nuke would, its much more effective over a short range and even a small device could disrupt communications networks.In the film: Neo sits down for a stomach-churning breakfast onboard the Nebuchadnezzar which consists of a single-celled protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals. Everything your body needs.But, as another character quips, it looks more like a bowl of snot.In reality: In our weight-conscious age, meal replacement products like Huel have exploded in recent years, with its manufacturers now being one of the fastest-growing companies in the UK.The idea with these kinds of meal replacements is to offer consumers their daily nutrients in a single product, or everything the body needs.Looks like well all be drinking our dinners soon."},{"url":null,"title":"tui holiday nightmare crete family","story":"PR worker Lisa Wood, , forked out for the special summer jaunt to Crete to celebrate her mum Glynis th birthday.Lisa booked out the Elounda Breeze hotel on the Greek island in April, while it was still being built, but was promised it would be ready for her family arriving later in the summer.But when she arrived at the hotel with parents David and Glynis, , her husband David, nephew Callum, , and five-year-old daughter Sienna, all was not well.She was told by staff that the two-bedroom family apartment booked for her parents and her -year-old nephew didnt exist.She said: When we arrived we saw my parents room and knew it was just too small.

I couldnt stop itching.Emilie says her parents and boyfriend are fully supportive of her decision not to use the prescribed medication anymore, but doctors have advised her she should continue it.But she says she is confident her skin will eventually heal naturally.She added: A lot of people have completely normal skin once theyve completed Topical Steroid Withdrawal, some people have minor eczema.I am going through a flare now. On steroid withdrawal, you usually flare for a few weeks then it goes back to normal.Ive been flaring for a while since last year. I am having to bandage my feet and hands, which I havent had to do for a year.Emilie also claims people around the world are suffering from Topical Steroid Withdrawal and wants doctors to recognise it as a condition.She added: I want doctors to acknowledge that steroid withdrawal is happening.I saw a dermatologist who told me I was selfish for not using steroids and that I was putting my family though hell and that I would never get better.If people are using it, the guideline is dont use it for more than two years.Be aware that it can thin your skin and suppress your immune system.If you notice your skin is getting worse, stop using it.There is a lack of medical assistance and it is frustrating because it is avoidable.Doctors see it as untreated eczema, it is not a medically registered condition.If I kept using the cream, I would never get better.Id rather go through a few years of this than have skin that will never heal. "},{"url":null,"title":"ghost of child caught on camera playing by the stairs inside haunted house in the middle of the night","story":"Footage shows a living room with a cat sitting in the middle but at the side a misty outline enters in the bottom right hand corner.The “figure” appears to move backwards and forwards before disappearing out of sight as the cat nonchalantly sits on the floor.The clip was uploaded to YouTube by Joel Nolan, who said it was taken earlier this month.“On August th,  at :am our security camera picked up a strange visitor walking through the kitchen,” he said.“Some claim its a little boy and their pet.

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors.

I had really bad joint pain and terrible headaches. I didn’t have any energy.By June, Aubrees health had deteriorated further - leaving her barely able to walk and throwing up blood.She added: “I lost my appetite and I had really bad chest pain.“I felt like I couldn’t breathe, like I wasn’t getting enough air in my lungs.“My neck was super stf and I couldn’t move it - I couldn’t turn my head fully.“I slept for hours and hours and I was still so tired.”Symptoms of lipoid pneumonia tend to worsen over time.In some cases, they can become severe or even le-threatening.Some common symptoms of lipoid pneumonia can include:Other, less common symptoms can include:Source: HealthlineAubree was admitted to Ogden Regional Medical Center on July  where an x-rays revealed she had contracted a virus.She was transferred to Brigham City Community Hospital where further tests revealed the grave extent of her condition.Doctors there told Aubree that her heart was severely inflamed - leading them to fear she was on the verge of a heart attack, she claims.She was rushed via air ambulance to specialists at the University of Utah Hospital and tests on the fluid in her lungs revealed vegetable glycerin was present.Aubree said: They did another chest x-ray and at that point they asked me: ‘Did you ever smoke  Did you ever vape ’“They told me that they had found vape oil in the fluid they had pulled out of my lungs.“They explained that I had lipoid pneumonia and it was caused by vaping.”Sean Maddock, of the University of Utah Hospital’s Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine program, said patients suffering vaping-related illnesses were on the rise.He said: “Our big concern is that we just don’t have a good sense of what exactly in these vaping products are causing these illnesses.“All these cases had oil breakdown and tissue.“We presume based on everything … that was most likely caused by the vaping.”Aubree spent a week in hospital being treated with antibiotics and steroids to fight the pneumonia - as well as oxygen to help her breath.She now expects to be on oxygen until at least October - forcing her to cut her working hours and delay plans to become a registered nurse.Aubree added: “I’ve given up vaping but I crave it like crazy.“Every time I see someone vape it makes me want to do it.”But she warned: “I don’t want others to go through this.“I want to raise awareness so people can look out for the symptoms.PUFFING on just one e-cigarette could increase your risk of heart attack or stroke, experts have warned.A single vaping session is all it takes to cause immediate and signicant damage to the bodys blood vessels, they found.A team of scientists at the University of Pennsylvania performed MRI scans on  healthy, non-smokers before and after using nicotine-free e-cigarettes.They found just one session puffing on the device caused reduced blood flow.Vaping was also found to damage the endothelium - a thin membrane that lines the inside of the heart and blood vessels - in the femoral artery, that supplies blood to the thigh and leg.The endothelium is essential for proper blood circulation, the studys authors said.Once its damaged, the arteries can thicken and blood flow to the heart or brain can be cut off - causing a heart attack or stroke.Professor Felix Wehrli, who led the study, said: While e-cigarette liquid may be relatively harmless, the vapourisation process can transform the molecules - primarily propylene and glycerol - into toxic substances.Beyond the harmful effects of nicotine, weve shown that vaping has a sudden, immediate effect on the bodys vascularand could potentially lead to long-term harmful consequences."},{"url":null,"title":"remain parties general election pacts poll","story":"A BMG Research survey for the Electoral Reform Society poll found  per cent of the public want all political parties to stand in all areas -

A government web page listed “dances in adult entertainment establishments” as one option for jobseekers with “no formal academic” skills. The Department for Work and Pensions site - titled work you could do - suggested claimants could search the phrase “striptease artist” online to find vacancies. The career was included as part of a list of elementary services occupations for people on Universal Credit. Other job suggestions on the same page included becoming a fortune-teller or loading a Bingo machine. The Mirror was able to browse the page on Tuesday but it has since been taken offline, hours after concerns were raised on an online welfare forum. A DWP spokesman admitted: “This is inappropriate and we will immediately review this to determine why it is mistakenly listed.    This is not the type of employment our work coaches help people into, and since  more than % of all new jobs created are high-skilled and full-time. A Whitehall source suggested the information had been sourced from a list of professions on the Office for National Statistics. Paul Morrison, a policy advisor to the Methodist Church who spotted the adverts, said: “Suggesting that people perform in strip clubs is clearly unacceptable.” He added it was part of a wider picture of Universal Credit “pushing people towards low paid, insecure jobs that exploit and trap families in poverty.” The Daily Mirror is campaigning to stop the rollout of Universal Credit and replace it with a fairer system. We say it should either be redesigned to be fit for purpose, replaced by a brand new system, or axed in favour of the old systemit is unfixable.

In June ministers said there was little reliable data to suggest the six-in-one benefit was pushing people towards sex work. But after watching testimony by women who said they were, DWP minister Will Quince said the previous memo did not reflect his thinking and we need to better understand this area.

Some of it was literal. Whether Everton or ­Liverpool would win the old First Division. Some of it was actual. Mum was Evertonian and dad Liverpudlian – a “mixed marriage”, as my grandad would say. I remember thinking, “I hate you, mum” because her team had beaten mine in the FA Cup in . This was when I used to stand alongside dad on the Kop. Before Everton signed me up and showed me the light. Obviously, I didn’t really hate my mum. I just felt like she had got it wrong. I had a similar feeling recently when she said: “Pete, I voted Leave.”  I replied: “Mum, Leave is Boris. Leave is Rees-Mogg. Leave is Michael Gove and David Davis.” She nodded and said she had changed her mind. I didn’t make some lofty economic argument full of big numbers and lost jobs, although I could have, as the North will be beaten up by a No Deal. I just reminded her of the people she was aligning with. People who do not represent us. People who do not share the same values. People who do not speak for us. In Liverpool, you see a dference every time a team gets to a final and flags hang from windows, or when you get in a taxi and are asked, “You a red or a blue ”, or when you get your first kit and kick a battered “casey”around on the “Georgies”as I did in my day.  But whether you are a red or a blue, you know what it means to come from Liverpool.You share working-class values and there is a sense that what brings us together is way bigger than our dferences .It’s why there are moments when our city’s red and blue are so close it’s almost purple. Like after Hillsborough, when the Kop was covered in red and blue scarves, by red and blue shirts, shedding red and blue tears. Contrast this with what populists like US President Donald Trump or Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would do. They point out dference. They would say: “If you are a blue, hate red because they are the enemy. If you are a blue, hate red because they are trying to change Liverpool. If you are a blue, hate red because they are not like you.    “If you are a blue, hate red because it is their fault. Hate the media too, because they are red. “And the politicians are red through-and-through. But you can trust us. We are blue. Like you.” It’s how Remainers became unpatriotic Remoaners, who hated Britain even though it is Brexiteers putting the union at risk. It’s how calling for a second referendum was twisted to become undemocratic. How can giving people a say based on what we know now, based on a clear understanding of Brexit, be undemocratic  It’s how the Second World War has been unforgivably recast, not as Europeansstanding alongside each other, dying alongside each other, in the fight against fascism, but as soldiers fighting to keep England separate, an island alone.  Or contrast Liverpool’s unity and sense of togetherness with the isive words published by former editor of The Spectator and our new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson: “They see themselves whenever possible as victims and resent their victim status, yet at the same time, they wallow in it. “Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone , thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society.” It goes on to talk of the “deaths of more than ” supporters and “the part played in the Hillsborough disaster by drunken fans at the back who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. “The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at wider causes of the incident.” It’s why Liverpool must never forgive Boris Johnson. I am not saying everyone from Liverpool is perfect. Esther McVey. Enough said.

Bill Duncan, , had been married to his we Anne,  for  years - but suffered an onset of dementia that caused him to lose most of his memory and forget parts of their le together. Convinced Anne was his new girlfriend, Bill proposed again last week. Devoted Anne was sure heaposd forget, but convinced she was his new girlfriend, smitten Bill persisted, and kept asking when theyaposd be walking down the aisle. They tied the knot again in an emotional garden ceremony at their home in Aberdeen on Saturday, and Anne said they are as happy as ever.    Weaposd been to a family memberaposs wedding earlier in the month, and clearly it touched Bill as he turned to me not long after and said that he wanted to be with me forever, Anne said. He asked me when would we be walking up the aisle together, and I thought he would just forget heaposd asked me that, but then the next day he said it again. I had some friends coming over on the weekend and thought that would be the perfect time to have our second wedding,Bill still wanted to by then. Every day, he asked me about our wedding, and finally on August , I walked down the aisle with my wonderful husband,  years after our first wedding.  Our friends pitched in to help with decorating the garden and providing a wedding cake, and my daughter Andrea convinced me to get a dress for the day too, she continued. We renewed our vows surrounded by a small group of our friends and family, and even added some bits in for Bill so it felt like he really was getting married. It was the most beautul day, and being with our friends in the garden we share together made it all the more perfect. The pair met in  when Bill was working as an entertainer and magician in Aberdeen. They married three years later, but Anne soon noticed Bill had started to forget things.  The pair visited the doctor and shortly after he was diagnosed with dementia. His health began to slowly deteriorate and he started losing memory of precious moments, including their wedding day. Anne became his full-time carer but Bill was convinced she was his girlfriend.

Travelling on a ferry, made world-famous by Gerry Marsden, from Liverpool’s Pier Head down the Mersey to the point where it meets the Irish Sea, then jumping off at New Brighton. For a day of pure bliss. Swimming in the open-air baths, playing football on the beach, searching for crabs, riding the waltzers in the fun-fair, eating chips as you battled away crazed seagulls, the vinegar smell mingling with the salt from the sea as you watch the big boats head into port. Then taking the evening ferry home, knackered and burnt.    Back then, New Brightonwas still a vibrant resort but one that was heading for the rocks. In the s, my mum’s family would spend summer holidays there. A huge marquee would be pitched to sleep up to a dozen children and my grandad would go to work on the Liverpool docks by day, ing at night. In the s, my dad and his brothers would take the ferry every summer weekend to show off in front of the local girls by ing off the high boards in the lido, then the UK’s biggest open-air pool. Parents who fondly looked on New Brighton as part of their heritage would take their kids for days out in the s, but come the s, with Pontins and Butlin’s taking off at home and package holidays abroad, as well as biting economic times, New Brighton fell into decline.  The ferry stopped sailing there, the famous Tower Ballroom was destroyed by fire and the lido closed. New Brighton, like many other historic British seaside towns, became dilapidated and unloved. In fact, it came close to extinction. But in , Wirral council, and a Labour government, recognised the potential of a regeneration plan centred on a £million leisure and retail development, Marine Point, and le was breathed back into the old place. It now gets a million visitors a year and on summer weekends the pavements are bustling and the beach is buzzing. When I ed there for the first time in many years, I was genuinely surprised at how handsome it’s looking.  For a start, it’s hard to imagine a Blue Flag beach in swimming distance of Liverpool’s docks, but the sand and the water measure up to that gold standard. I cast my crab line out in the clear rock pools, but, now veggie, I refused to put bacon on the hook, and the little nippers turned their claws up at the tofu. I cooled my tootsies with a paddle in the sea, which was as freezing as I remembered it, but looked nothing like the murky brown colour of old. I larked around on the Black Pearl pirate shipuntil it was clear I was shivering the timbers of approaching teachers shepherding primary schoolkids. I took a long, bracing walk along the three-quarters-of-a-mile of sand and bumped into Peter and Alison Greene, from Chester, and their four-year-old granddaughter Alice. What brought them to New Brighton, I asked   “It’s just a great, cheap and cheerful day out. Alice loves to play on the pirate ship and make sandcastles, then get an ice cream,” said Alison, a retired carer. “I stopped coming here for years, but I look forward to our days out now. It feels like a proper seaside resort again.” Peter, also retired, said: “I had days out here as a boy, when it was in its heyday. It’s moved with the times, but I love how you can still feel the history of the place.” New Brighton oozes history. From the th to the th century, it had a reputation for smuggling and wrecking, with secret underground cellars and tunnels rumoured to still be in existence. Fort Perch Rock was built in the Napoleonic Wars to protect the port of Liverpool from the French. Disputes over who should pay meant it wasn’t finished until , when Boney was well gone.  The building now houses an Aviation and Archaeology Museum, with a section on the Luftwaffe’s blitzing of Merseyside. At the start of the last century, the resort had the tallest building in Britain, the ft, all-steel New Brighton Tower, which was neglected during the First World War and dismantled shortly after. Walking around, you can take a nostalgia trip while enjoying what the resort offers current and future visitors. There are watersports on the marine lake and regular open-air events on seafront stretches they call The Dips. The revamped Floral Pavilion is flourishing and I never thought I’d see Bella Italia, Prezzo, Starbucks and Travelodge investing here, and making profits.

She agreed a price of £, with the builder for the work and moved out into a rented house with the hope that the refurbishment would only take  weeks. But Nichola said the dream turned into a disaster when she found out that the house had not been completed - after the cost of the project spiralled to £,. Now, she has to sleep on the sofa at her daughteraposs house. Nichola said: Iaposve been sleeping on my daughteraposs sofa since May and I havenapost been able to sleep under my own roof in my own home since February. Itaposs been an absolute nightmare, my two dogs and I are living with my daughter in her two bedroom house.    Iaposve had break downs, the stress has been terrible, Iaposve had sleepless nights.

She selected a builder who told her the work would cost £, and moved into rented accommodation. Nichola said: I more or less decided around Christmas that I wanted to do the house up and I mentioned to the girls and my son that I was going to get builders in to give me quotes. I chose the builder that I did because he made me feel comfortable in the house and it seemed like he would take care of everything. He claimed he could do a  minute makeover and Iaposd come back into the house and it would be done. He also said I wouldnapost need to worry and that heaposd deal with all the contractors and manage everything.    He gave me a quote and the price was right so I asked him to go ahead and start the job. The work began in February and at the end of the first week Nichola made the first payment of £,. At the beginning of April Nichola claims things started to go wrong. When she asked for an update on the work with the expectation that she would soon be able to move in she was told repeatedly that more time was needed. She alleges that despite paying money for work to be done on the property much of it was never completed and what work took place was of poor quality. The costs for the project also increased after the builder informed Nichola that the house had severe damp and required rewiring, increasing the overall cost to £,. She said: He hadnapost finished the tiling, putting the skirting boards on, finished the wiring or anything like that. He hadnapost finished the front of the house either.

Hannah Fraser was about to start her PE exam on May  last year when her dad suddenly turned up at Range High School. After the -year-old was told by her headteacher you need to go to hospital, but youaposll be okay, Hannahaposs dad bundled her into the family car and drove to Alder Hey Childrenaposs Hospital.There the teenage received the le changing diagnosis by a doctor, who explained she had a tumour wrapped around her windpipe, Liverpool Echo reported .The ailment came to light after the Liverpool girl visited her GP complaining of tiredness. When the prescribed iron tablets for anaemia failed to do the trick, mum Denise took her back to the doctors where more tests were carried out along with a CT scan.    Just days after a tumour showed up on the scan, Hannah was told she was suffering from a rare type of cancer called Hodgkin Lymphoma. Hannah, who is now , is speaking out to raise awareness about her condition and to give other people hope. She said: I was just stood outside the exam room going into my PE exam when my friend said your dad is here. I tried not to think about it because I was about to do an exam but then I just heard the head teacher walking down the corridor. She told the exam invigilator I will sort her papers out and she told me Iaposd be okay but I needed to go to hospital. When we got there we had to go to ward b and when we went in I knew straight away that I had cancer because of all the posters on the hospital wall. We waited to see a professor and he told me you have a tumour around your wind pipe. He said he was pretty certain it was Hodgkin Lymphoma but they would do a biopsy to check.    He was planning on keeping me in over night but because of how well I was he said they would do the tests the next week. After a biopsy confirmed the diagnosis, Hannah had to have her lymph nodes removed. And she began receiving chemotherapy and steroids to treat the illness. I was just in shock. I wasnapost really feeling anything at first. I think it properly sunk in when I lost my hair, she continued. I got a lot of my hair cut off before it started to fall out because I didnapost want to watch it fall out. I woke up one morning and there was clumps of hair on my pillow. And another day I woke up and my face was so swollen, that was when it sunk in that this is what Iaposm going to look like. I put on three stone because of the steroids, that was probably the worst thing. Hannahaposs diagnosis also left mum Denise Carver, , in a state of shock. It was the biggest shock of my le, she said. I took her to the doctors because I thought she could be anaemic. They gave her some iron tablets but they didnapost work so we went back about three weeks later and they upped her dose. Then when we went back a third time they did some more tests and a scan. The nurse rang me to say something has shown up on the scan.    Despite having just been dropped off by her mum for the exam, Hannah had to be picked up a short while after because doctors wanted to admit her immediately.  They couldnapost believe she was that fit and well when they saw her, they thought she was going to be in so much pain, Denise added. So they started her procedures the following week and she had to have her lymph nodes removed. At the same time as battling her illness and undergoing chemotherapy, Hannah decided to carry on doing the rest of her GCSE exams at home with an invigilator. On August , the -year-old who thought she wasnapost going to pass them, discovered she had achieved an amazing  GCSEaposs including English, Maths and Science. Hannah said: I didnapost really expect to pass any of them. I didnapost want to open my results with everyone , they were all really happy with their results. So my teacher took me into her office and said go on open them. When I opened the envelope I burst out crying I couldnapost believe it, I rang my mum crying.    She was standing with the other mums and she thought I was crying because I was upset at first but they were happy tears. She ran over and hugged me and then all the other mums came running over afterwards, it was really good. The good news didnapost stop there.

Mia Cuddington,  was on her third driving lesson in Sheerness, Kent when a Silver Impreza came hurtling towards her as the driver fled from police. The driver swerved onto the pavement and around Mia followed shortly after by three police vehicles in hot pursuit. Not knowing what to do the helpless teen slammed on her brakes and screamed: “Oh my god, oh my god. Help me, what are we going to do ” to her driving instructor Darren Willett. She is then heard saying: Oh my god, what’s happening  Oh my god, I’m so stressed out right now.    Rookie driver Mia was only  minutes into her third lesson, and was left shaken and unable to continue after the incident last Thursday. Officers were pursuing the driver after they had earlier tried to pull the car over as it was uninsured, but the driver failed to stop. Speaking afterwards Mia said: “I drove around the corner but had to finish my lesson early. “I was in shock and still shaking and not in a fit state to drive.” Mr Willett of Willett’s School of Motoring has been a driving instructor for  years and had never seen a real police chase - let alone whilst teaching.  Mr Willett,  said: “I heard the sirens and then suddenly saw the Subaru turn into the road ahead. “We were shocked when the driver took to the pavement and then again when the police followed either side of us. “It’s the school holidays, children are usually out and about playing everywhere – luckily, the weather wasn’t good today, so I think most had stayed indoors.” Speaking today he added: “I won’t be charging for the lesson, I can’t expect my pupil to pay when she has been scared like that!”  Officers continued to pursue the vehicle for just over two miles until the driver abandoned the vehicle after running out of petrol. The unidentied -year-old man, who was also found to be in possession of cannabis, was released pending further enquiries.

Gemma Lynch, Emma Page, Sian McGreary, Gemma Albiston, Gemma Roughsedge and Katy Wynne decided to hide the container as -year-olds to capture memories of their friendships in .The memorabilia featured posters of men they fancied such as popstar Peter Andre and copies of Just Seventeen with a young Holly Willoughby on the cover.The pals also buried diary entries and handwritten notes predicting each othersapos future lives, such as their careers and what sort of men they would end up with. But they mates lost touch after leaving school in Helsby, Cheshire.   However, Emma contacted the girls on Facebook after a recent segment on Blue Peter gave her the idea to unearth their capsule.And the friends, now aged , reunited last month on Helsby Hill armed with shovels and metal detectors. They were left screaming with joy when they found the steel cylinder. Incredibly, they managed to accurately predict four of their future careers. Emma has indeed become a primary school teacher, and Gemma Albiston works with animals as she went on to become a dog groomer. Gemma Lynch was also touted as a teacher, which she was for  years, and the girls said Sian would become an office worker. We had captured who we were at the time. We used to write little letters to each other,one of us went into another lesson.    We wrote things about each other and predictions and some of those were correct. There was a lot in there signicant to us, it was about our friendship group, Emma, from Kelsall, Cheshire, said. The mum-of-two described having goosebumps when they found the capsule. The teacher added: It was a goosebumps moment when we found it. It took about  minutes to dig it up and it was a feeling of elation for all of us. We took up some prosecco to celebrate and it was such an emotional day but in a good way.  The whole day was a rollercoaster of emotions and laughter. There was a copy of Just Seventeen magazine, which was the magazine we used to all read at the time. Funnily, when we opened it, on the cover was Holly Willoughby, she must have been -years-old at the time and must have been a clothing model. As we looked back at the stuff, it was a reflection of how the times have changed.  Everything is on social media now, no one writes letters anymore, people donapost print photos out as much. Gemma Lynch, who now works as a nursery inspector, said: We were gobsmacked when we saw how accurate they were. Also I am getting married next week and one of the girls had drawn a wedding dress which is pretty much identical to the one Iaposm going to be wearing. Digging up the time capsule was a day to remember filled with emotion, love and laughter. We put all of things in there, we had photos, predictions of our futures, our favourite snacks and friendship bracelets.  We put Twiglets, Wrigleys Extra chewing gum and coins in case they changed over the years. Inside was books that we sprayed with our favourite perfumes, one was called Fuzzy Peach and the other was called Dewbury, I used to wear those perfumes in .

But now, the potentially deadly disease has ed as fewer children are being vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is offered from free on the NHS and protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Two doses of the jab mean  percent of people are protected against one of the worldaposs most contagious diseases. Two jabs have been offered in the UK since  but a damning report by now disgraced doctor, Andrew Wakefield, has seen take-ups of the vaccine decline.    The majority of the new measles cases are now being found in people who have not been vaccinated. In the first three months of this year alone there have been  cases of measles compared to just  in the whole of . Experts from the World Health Organisation, who have revoked the UKaposs measle-free status because of the sharp rise in the number of cases, say some people may be opting out of the vaccine because they have become complacent to the risk of measles. But another key factor is the publication of Wakefieldaposs research in the late s. In it, he claimed there was a link with the MMR vaccine and autism, which has now been discredited and Wakefield struck off the UKaposs medical register.    And his damning report not only led to a downturn in the number of people having the vaccine in Britain, it also affected take-up rates in the US. The MMR vaccine is a totally safe jab. Wakefield is now a staunch supporter of the anti-vaccination movement and has even directed a film, Vaxxed, which claims to show a US health cover-up. However, the film had to be withdrawn from the Tribecca film festival after founder Robert De Niro would not allow it to be included. Despite this, Wakefield is said to have several powerful supporters, including US President Donald Trump.    But despite the controversy surrounding the disgraced doctor, he is reported to be in a relationship with one of the worldaposs most beautul women - model Elle Macpherson. Dubbed The Body because of her stunning figure and ageless beaut, the pair were snapped buying organic vegetables from a supermarket and kissing as they made their purchases. His relationship with the model came after he and his we, Carmel, along with their children fled to the US at the height of the controversy following the publication of his MMR research. Wakefield is believed to have left the family home early last year and is said to have met Elle shortly aftewards at an awards ceremony.    They have been snapped holding hands together several times since and Wakefield is said to be infatuated with the supermodel, known for her healthy lestyle.Brian Burrowes, the man who edited Wakefieldaposs controversial documentary Vaxxed, told Mail Online : Heaposs obviously a bit infatuated. He did say to me aposBrian, how did this happen aposI laughed and said I really didnapost know how this happened. Iaposm just really happy for him. Elle and Wakefield are also said to have enjoyed several mini-breaks, visiting friends. The model is also reported to be responsible for Wakefieldaposs trimmer figure after introducing him to dferent health foods and switching up his wardrobe.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

They have got the choice of three roads. The first is the C, which is impossible. Somebody would get killed every day.ldquoThe second is the Lowood Bridge and that is unsuitable.ldquoIf anybody is on that bridge, how will a -tonne lorry be able to pass  If it tried to squeeze through, it would hit the people and would crush them.ldquoThe other option is bringing the traffic through the town and the community of Galashiels does not want that.ldquoThe roads were not built for that use. It is dangerous.ldquoThere never has been a route proposed on this application and there is still not one to this day.ldquoSo how could it have been approved, without knowing where the traffic is going Melrose community councillor Mr Douglas claimed SBC was ldquounnecessarily endangering the publicrsquos lives and putting financial expedience before public safety in a letter to council chief executive Tracey Logan.And he asked to see a copy of a lsquopre-planning application decisionrsquo on potential vehicle routes.But, in a response, Ms Logan said: ldquoI have been advised no such document exists.She added the council had considered a transport statement and a report from the public consultation process.However, she admitted: ldquoNo detail of vehicle routes was included within either document. This was principally because at the time of the planning application, the contract for removing and treating wasted had not yet been awarded, meaning that the end destination was not known.ldquoThe council has recently awarded the contract for waste recycling to Levenseat, a company based near Forth in North Lanarkshire.

This is standard, legal practice. Safety is our number one priority when arranging home to school transport.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe are working with colleagues across the council and in schools to ensure that all pupils who have been issued with a bus pass are on the transport providersrsquo lists and to improve access to the school transport timetables.ldquoWe recognise that this may have caused uncertainty for parents, carers and pupils.ldquoOur staff and the transport providers will continue to work closely together to manage the transition to these new arrangements.Councillor Craig Hoy, ward member, said: ldquoI was relieved to get clear reassurance from council staff on the issues of vehicle safety and the safety of children travelling from Gford and outlying areas to Knox Academy.ldquoItrsquos clear that there were communications problems which impacted parents and pupils. Managing this sort of process is never easy, but the council and operators should try to learn from this experience before any future changes to bus operators or routes."},{"url":null,"title":"lightning-strikes-house-east-lothian-drenched-storm","story":"Torrential rain led to flooding in many parts of the county, with floodwaters just minutes away from flowing into homes before subsiding just in time.In Prestonpans, the police and fire service rushed to Dolphingstone View after a two-storey terraced house was struck by several bolts of lightning, causing a ruptured gas main and a fire in the roof at pm on Saturday evening.Fire engines from Dalkeith, Tollcross, Musselburgh and McDonald Road in Edinburgh were called out to the scene, along with police.Amanda Milne lives next door to the house that was struck by the lightning.She told the Courier: ldquoThe strike set fire to their attic and also the gas box that we all have outside our front doors.ldquoWe knew when the lightning struck that it hit something nearby as it lit up the sky and went out with a huge bang louder than the rest of them.ldquoOur power went off straight away and at that point it was quite scary, especially with a petried toddler and dog.Amandarsquos partner, Murray McKeown, took her and -month-old Ollie to his motherrsquos house as they were evacuated from their home when the fire engines arrived.She added: ldquoMy partner got us in the car and drove us somewhere safe until the firefighters put the fire out and the gas men had done their checks.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

Now that claim is seemingly dead in the water, the Tories have hit on a new way to boost an economy they seem hell-bent on ruining: raise the state pension age to  and, thanks to the combination of more workers and fewer pensioners, the state will stand to benefit to the tune of poundbn.According to the Centre for Social Justice - a right-wing think-tank chaired by benefits-slasher and one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - existing policies that will see the state pension age rise from  to  in  and then again to  by  should not only be speeded up, they should be turbo-charged too. Indeed, with the proportion of the population reaching pension age growing far faster than the proportion reaching working - and hence tax-paying - age, the organisation has mooted raising the state pension age to  by  before ramping it up to  just seven years later.At face value it almost seems like a reasonable plan. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, it was only ever meant to act as an insurance policy to be cashed in by those unlucky enough to make it into an infirm old age. With just a quarter of the population living long enough to receive it, the cost of providing that version of the pension was relatively small.Due to dramatic increases in le expectancy in the intervening years, though, state pension provision has become a hugely costly business, with the near poundbn the Government pays out to pensioners now expected to balloon to closer to poundbn in little over a decade.As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, with the taxes paid by todayrsquos workers funding the pensions paid to todayrsquos pensioners, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense raising the pension age is the most obvious way to ameliorate the impact. After all, anything that can reduce the burden on taxpayers while also increasing the pool of workers paying into the system has got to be a good idea, right Well, yes, only there are three glaring problems that show why the plan in its current form should never have seen the light of day. The most obvious issue with forcing swt and dramatic changes to retirement plans is that great swathes of the population are finding it hard enough to work beyond  as it is, never mind keeping on going to  and beyond. Sure, many people are more than capable of continuing to work beyond the official retirement age of , and many do so out of choice. But for those who have spent  years scrubbing floors or laying bricks, fighting fires or digging roads working into later le may not be an option.The state already makes allowances for those in the former group, giving all workers the option to defer taking their state pension infor enhanced payments when they do decide to draw it. Those in the latter group have no such luxury, though, with no systems in place to enable those who cannot keep working to take their pension early at a suitably reduced rate. The implication for them is clear:the pension age is raised further many people will face the stark option of either continuing in a physically demanding job they are physically unfit to do or potentially falling into poverty.The risk of the latter is all too real, with a study from Professor Bernhard Ebbinghaus of the University of Oxford finding that the proportion of over-s living in severe poverty in the UK is already five times what it was in , with our state pension provision largely to blame.The UK is, Professor Ebbinghaus said, ldquoa good example of the Beveridge-lite systems that have historically failed to combat old-age poverty because they ldquohave rather ungenerous basic pensions with means-tested supplements which ldquoreproduce relatively high severe poverty rates among the elderly. Low though the state pension may be, putting it further out of that age-grouprsquos reach is hardly likely to help solve the problem.Then therersquos the question of le expectancy. While it is true that part of the dficulty in accounting for the state pension is that people now typically live for  years or more in retirement, in some parts of the country - and Scotland in particular - that is not the case. And while Scottish males being born today are expected to make it to  and females to , there is no expectation that anyone born between  and  - the first cohort that would be impacted by the mooted pension-age rises - will make it to .That is the crux of why the proposal cannot be allowed to fly. Yes, itrsquos a fallacy that each of us has a pension pot sitting at Westminster with our name on it - and, no, none of us has a right to be supported in retirement by the state - but it would be a cynical government indeed that would expect its citizens to pay the pensions of older generations without any hope of ever getting one of their own. It would be an egregious breach of the social contract and no exaggeration.The Centre for Social Justice has its own spin on the age-rise proposal, with its chief executive Andy Cook saying that by finding ways to help older people stay in work the Government would be doing its bit to improve their health and wellbeing. But as those who want to do that already have the means of doing so, the proposal smacks more of finding ways for a Government staring financial ruin in the face to cut its own costbase.Sure the state pension is expensive, and sure it makes sense to find ways of limiting the extent to which that cost will grow.

Some rural towns ndash such as Lochgelly in Fe, Gourock in Inverclyde and Dornoch in Sutherland, have no banking infrastructure at all, which is harming local businesses.Camleys cartoon: Rural towns under pressureIt also found that while the Highlands has a self-employment rate of about  per cent, in some parts of the country it is signicantly less, with many locals instead forced out of numerous areas in search of work after traditional industries closed.Now the FSB is demanding that a new Scottish Government commission be set up to tackle the blight of empty properties.The group also wants banks to deliver on the shared hubs promise they made when they closed branches and the FSB also wants fresh help for independent traders to better utilise digital technologies.Andrew McRae, FSBrsquos Scotland policy chairman, said: ldquoMore people in Scotland live in towns thancities. Thatrsquos why governments in Edinburgh and London must make a generational investment in our towns to overcome their current challenges and prepare them for how wersquoll work and live in the future.Despite their big city focuses, both UK and Scottish governments have funding packages for small towns.Mr McRae took some credit forScotlandrsquos.He said: ldquoFollowingFSB campaigning, last year theScottish Government announced extra funding to boost Scottish towns. We need to build on this initiative because inclusive growth canrsquot only be a priority for city-dwellers.ldquoAfter the wave of recent closures, we need to rethink how we use our high streets. A new commission should investigate the barriers to bringing vacant properties back into use, eventhat means turning offices into housing, or department stores into art galleries.ldquoSimilarly, we need to make it cheap and easy for independentbusinesses to take up high street property and we believe a standard small business lease could be part ofthis solution.The FSB report, called Transforming Towns, urges the Scottish and UK governments to direct the Scottish National Investment Bank and the UK Stronger Towns Fund respectively to invest in these places.In its report, the FSB praises what it calls innovative work to fill empty retail units.However, it wants Scottish ministers to set up a commission to tackle the rise of vacant properties.High Street vacancy rates inInverclyde, where depopulation and deindustrialisation have hit hardest, top %.The figure is nearly as high in North Lanarkshire. The national average is about %.In the last three years, more than  local bank branches have closed or are winding down across Scotland. The FSB now forecasts the number of branches across the country will soon fall below , compared to , branches in . Meanwhile, around  cash machines close each month north of the Border.Mr McRae said: ldquoIn terms of local closures, the banks are the worst offenders. At the very least, they should make good on their promise to introduce shared banking hubs and we would urge them to start withthe largest towns that have no banks.ldquoMany smaller businesses are at the forefront of using new technologies to boost their efficiency, productivity and most importantly sales. But others may be behind the curve.Scottish Enterprise should develop a programme to give local traders a helping hand.The FSB was backed byPhil Prentice, of Scotlandrsquos Towns Partnership.He said: ldquoThe time is right for a renewed focus and investment for our town centres and high streets.

Being part of this national initiative will ensure some of our local recordings of Scots music will be digitally preserved and available to folk at home and abroad for future enjoyment and learning.”Alastair Hardie, one of the trustees acting on behalf of the late John Junner, said: “In his will, John Junner asked for his collection to be kept ‘at a suitable location in northeast Scotland’.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.deesidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rehomed Horse of Year  Tinto and Fiona Bell.\"  Tinto has been so much more than a friend viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DEES | Article Teaser\"\"Ten years after his death, his wish has finally been fulfilled with this donation.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The review aims to ensure the police service continues to grow and develop.\"  Your views could shape the future of policing in Scotland viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Orkney already generates more than enough renewable energy to meet the needs of our community. The islands are taking a world leading role as a hub for renewables and hydrogen innovation – and for an ever expanding range of research, development and community-led projects.“But we cannot do this alone and continuing support from government will be crucialwe are to overcome the challenges and so make the most of the opportunities for Orkney to take a lead in achieving our shared carbon-neutral ambitions.”He added: “This was a key focus for what were very positive discussions.”During her time in Orkney, Councillor Stockan accompanied the cabinet secretary on a visit to the Kirkwall Harbour Flood Defence Scheme, a £. million project backed by  per cent funding from the Scottish Government.There was also a visit to the project to supply locally produced #green# electrical power to the MV Hamnavoe while docked in Stromness – substantially reducing the ferry’s carbon emissions.In addition, the cabinet secretary saw the work of Kirkwall-based Restart Orkney, a social enterprise which sells good quality second hand furniture and other household items at affordable prices.The venture helps protect the environment, as many of the items would otherwise have ended up being incinerated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period. I look forward to seeing the improvements that are made and the effect these have on our historic streets.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions by phoning  ,# said those involved.A spokesperson for the project went on to say: “A huge thanks to all the landowners who have helped us by agreeing the essential land access we need to get started. With their support together we can protect Orkney’s unique wildle for future generations.”The traps will be laid around  metres apart in preferred stoat habitat, which may include some road verges. They will be checked regularly by the project staff.The Orkney Native Wildle Project is a partnership between Orkney Islands Council, Scottish Natural Heritageand RSPB Scotland. Following three years of development generous support for the project has been provided by, the Heritage Lottery Fund and EU Le, providing a combined grant of £. million for the duration of the five-year project.Stoats are native to the UK Mainland but not to Orkney, where they were first recorded in . Since then the population has increased rapidly and is now fully established and widely-distributed throughout Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay. Those involved said that they are grateful for any sightings of stoats which can be reported via the Stoats in Orkney Facebook page giving a map grid reference.Stoats pose a very serious threat to Orkney#s native wildle particularly the Orkney vole, hen harrier, short-eared owl and other ground nesting birds such as red-throated ers, Arctic terns and curlews for which Orkney is internationally important and upon which Orkney’s thriving wildle tourism industry relies.Keep up to date with the blog ‘Stoat Snippets’, the Orkney Native Wildle Project Facebook page at www.facebook OrkneyNativeWildleProject or visit www.ONWP.orgcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed. This has been part-funded through the Island of Hoy Development Trust.Repairs to the Romney Hut at Lyness and options for the Oil Tank will be considered at a later date.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To make sure you can have your say at future elections, simply check the form you receive and respond as soon as possible.“All responses can now be made online and we would encourage householders, where possible, to use this method rather than ing the form in the post.”People who have changed address recently are particularly encouraged to keep an eye out for the form and check the details.Research by the independent Electoral Commission indicates that recent home movers are far less likely to be registered than those who have lived at the same address for a long period of time.Across the UK,  per cent of people who have been at their property for more than sixteen years will be registered, compared to  per cent of people who have lived at an address for less than a year.Further information about registering to vote is available on the Electoral Commission website at https:www.yourvotematters Any residents who have any questions can contact the Electoral Registration Office at  Broad Street, Kirkwall.

We are exceptionally lucky to have the support of thousands of music fans, who bought tickets for nine outstanding shows, which included local artists too, during Summer Sessions in Princes Street Gardens. Whilst sales tell us that people love these concerts, we face the inevitable complaints from a few, including Clf Hague of the Cockburn Association in Scotland On Sunday at the weekend.We are all entitled to opinions, but I feel a duty to respond in the interests of fairness and honesty, and to stand up for music lovers in this city. : Princes St gigs mean curtains for common good – Clf HagueAt DF Concerts  Events, we’re all about making incredible cultural experiences accessible to as many people as possible. We’re proud to be at the forefront of the hugely important music scene in Scotland. Our Summer Sessions concerts attract international appeal, bringing , visitors into the Gardens, a third of whom reside in Edinburgh, to enjoy music surrounded by a stunning setting.We understand Clf may personally dislike the music of Lewis Capaldi and Tom Jones, but that doesn’t mean he should deny Edinburgh audiences from seeing them outdoors in their city – which is realistically the alternative. The Gardens are for everyone to enjoy, including music fans. To deny such joys is both selfish and elitist. We received feedback that the experience we offer for accessible customers is magnicent and beyond what is offered by most event organisers. The sarcastic comments regarding Summer Sessions are largely childish. We work with Police Scotland and council officials to ensure safety is maintained throughout. We listened to feedback, installing a retractable curtain to allow full views of the Gardens during the day. A happy medium, in my view. Safety is our only concern with regards to the screening, and the barriers have been placed in front of the benches to prevent anyone climbing railings and risking injury. There is still ample space to walk on the pavements butpeople congregate there, it becomes unsafe. If Clf’s aversion is to ticketed events, I wonderhe appreciates that “free” concerts must still be paid for, presumably as a burden to council tax payers. The city council would lose revenue from renting out the Gardens, which are not free to hire.In fact, the fireworks which Mr Hague approves of may only take place for one night each year, but actually block access to the Gardens for a week beforehand. It begs the question – why isn’t he consistent in his disapproval Furthermore, not that I have any issue with the fantastic event, I’ve never seen criticism from such commentators on the fencing blocking Charlotte Square each year for the Book Festival. Is this one rule for literature and another for rock ‘n’ roll  That hardly seems fair.Eyes from around the world are on Edinburgh during August, and it feels right that locals and visitors can enjoy an iconic music festival as part of the festivities, boosting the atmosphere and civic pride in the city. We’re bringing communities together, and generating hundreds of thousands of pounds for the local economy at the same time. With the images the world sees of our stage beneath the iconic Edinburgh Castle, we are doing our bit to promote the beauty of Edinburgh on an international scale to potential visitors. Perhaps Lords Cockburn and Moncref would have approved!It’s been said that these concerts are Scotland’s Red Rocks equivalent. I would argue that they are even better, and we hope to be back again in !

The poet is right to point out that in , the average Scottish child will be unaware of how Glasgow’s grand cityscape was builton ­proceeds from the slave trade. But neither will they, nor the vast majority of their parents, realise the long-forgotten role one Scots emigrant played in American slavery. I have spent several monthsdeveloping a documentary project about the Hairstons, a fascinating family which, at one point, had one of the largest slaveholdings in the antebellum south. Its historic patriarch, Peter Hairston, was born in ­Dumfries in the twilight of the th century, and became a loyal ­Jacobite. But after the Battle of Preston in , he fled to Ireland before emigrating to the American colonies with his we and five children.They settled in Virginia, where Hairston and his sons secured  acres of fertile land for a tobacco plantation in Goochland County, and a succession of slaves to work it.From that modest holding of the man known nowadays as Peter the Immigrant, an empire grew. Within the space of three generations, the Hairstons came to own around , slaves across  plantations spanning four southern states. The wealth they accrued was ­dizzying. An  edition of the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser newspaper declared Samuel Hairston – Peter’s great grandson – to be the “richest man in Virginia”. A census showed he owned between , and , slaves, and with plantations across Virginia and North Carolina, it is estimated he was worth as much as million. These are familiar traits of the Hairston story – fortunes forged on the back of human misery, ­preserved by rape, coercion, and concubinage, and recorded in meticulous detail in ledger books referencing the dollar value of each man, woman, and child.Yet the narrative is altogether more complex in places, such as the story of Samuel’s brother, Robert, who had secured his own sprawling plantation estate by the time he lay on his deathbed in . One of his final acts was to rewrite his will toemancipate his only child, a slave girl called Chrillis, and leave her his entire fortune. But in a country on the verge ofwar, such a bequest could never stand. The courts denied Chrillis her inheritance and her freedom. Such stories are extraordinary but not exceptional. Countless slave children were given the family name and, in time, formed clans of their own.Not all found brighter futures. One of the family’s most prominent ­living members, Ever Lee Hairston, was born on Cooleemee, a North Carolina plantation where the Hairstons had once enslaved  people. Many,not all, left after abolition. Those who stayed included Ever Lee’s house servant grandparents. Their children did likewise, working as sharecroppers. Even though the Civil War had ended nearly a century previously, Ever Lee was expected to follow suit when she was born in . She spent her early years picking cotton and sleeping in an old slave cabin, before fleeing as a teenager, having realised her family had been ­effectively brainwashed.The youngest generation of Hairstons share her determination to provide a warts and all account of the past. Princess Hairston, an Emmy-nominated film editor from New York, is working on a film about the white and black descendants of Peter the Immigrant. She hopes in time to screen the completed feature in Dumfries. That is, after all, where the story began, and the family’s Scottish roots have long provided its white lineage with a conveniently innocuous backstory. “A lot of white Hairstons weren’t told the family history about how they were one of the biggest slaveowners,” ­Princess told me. “The Scottish heritage became something they ­emphasised to look at their past in a dferent way.”None of these hard truths would have been realised were it not for the prodigious research of Henry Wiencek, who wrote a spellbinding  history of the family, and Peter Wilson Hairston, the sixth generation owner of Cooleemee and a former Superior Court judge. Before his death in  at the age of , he availed himself of the sprawling Hairston archives, ­compiling a history which shone a light on dark places and secured a rapprochement between two families who, through slavery, were one.Earlier this month, the National Hairston Clan held its th annual reunion, with its members ­gathering at Cooleemee, where their descendants once toiled, ­suffered, and often against their will, ensured the continuance of an astonishing legacy. Very few people in the Hairstons’ ancestral homeland will be aware of their story, butthey have found the strength to overcome the lies, mythmaking and silence that for so long obscured the truth, we in Scotland should draw inspiration and ensure we too ask ourselves some searching questions, no matter how uncomfortable the answers. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"parents share update on fate of boy 6 who fell five storeys from tate modern","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The child, who was visiting from France, suffered injuries including a brain bleed and spinal, leg and arm fractures after being allegedly thrown by a -year-old boy from a th-floor viewing  at the art gallery on August .His parents issued a statement to the organiser of a fundraising page set up on their behalf which has received donations of almost £,.They said: \"Our son has already undergone two long and dficult operations. - Mice droppings and mould found at Michelin-starred The Kitchin in Edinburgh\"He is stabilised, but we still do not know the full extent and severity of his injuries.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too.

I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me.

No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there.

While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

has rejected the findings of a poll which revealed that almost three out of five voters in Northern Ireland would prefer a border down the Irish Sea to a hard Brexit.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit general election once-in-a-generation chance for changeJohnson under pressure to recall Parliament following no-deal Brexit warningsSome .% of respondents said they would vote in favour of \"a border in the Irish Sea\" and would rather Northern Ireland remained more closely aligned with the EU than Great Britain.Some .% said they would reject the compromise, while .% said they did not know.Within the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist side.\"In contrast to the  of people that they poll, the people that I talk to in my own constituency do not share that view at all. data-dfpadtargetingSir Jeffrey Donaldson\"A clear majority of them would not support Northern Ireland being separated from the UK.\"As the UK hurtles towards its exit from the European Union, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said will go ahead with or without a deal on October , experts have warned that at least , jobs could be at risk in Northern Irelandan agreement is not reached.Sir Jeffrey said the survey has no bearing on his partys position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with % of Alliance voters and % Green Party voters backing the proposition."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley. A bit like in a video game.

And to prove it, as part of the course recent guest lecturers have included  Eoin O’Callaghan  ,  Phil Nelson  ,  Tony Perrey and  Gareth Stewart  . As part of the course students have visited SSE Arena, Belfast , London West End Theatre, Output Music Conference, Belfast and have partaken in student collaboration weeks in Kokkola , Talinnand Glasgow.  Rory  and  Grainne  then tell me about the end of year show which is a collaborative effort between the departments to re-imagine popular films, last year it was “Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and included a pit orchestra and utilised the equipment available to students to reproduce scenes they couldn’t perform live on camera. That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there. I have actually seen this course being taught myself and, I’m not just saying it, but it is something that I wish I had done myself. The list of Full-Time Music and Performing Arts Courses includes Level  Music Production Level  Music Performance Level  Music Technology Level   Music Level   Music Production Level  Performing Arts  Level  Performing Arts Level   Performing Arts Prospective students need no qualications to apply at level  and can potentially graduate at Level  and do a one-year top up to full honours degree. Online application and details of courses we run can be found at  http:www.nwrc.ac.uk apply  Start date for Full-Time courses this year is September nd.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"mixed emotions achieved set danny bradley","story":"The brother of a teenage IRA member killed by the British Army almost  years ago has said that hes achieved what he set out to do after a Coroner last week ruled ruled that killing was unjustied.Seamus Bradley was shot by a member of the Royal Scots Regiment during what was known as Operation Motorman-a large scale British Army incursion into the no go districts of nationalist areas in Derry in the early hours of July , .The death was a point of major contention for almost half-a-century with the British Army claiming at the time that the teenager was armed and in a tree when he was shot. They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA.

All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -. At the opposite end Shane Murray blasted over the bar when he was played through by Jones and then Killyleagh thought they had pulled it back to - to set up a grandstand finish when Nealersquos shot was spilled and Dylan Kelly rled home, but the referee ruled he had been in an offside position when the initial shot was delivered.No one was leaving early and at this rate, there will be plenty looking to book their place for thematch later in the season.By then, Olympic will hope they have further underscored that they are the team best equipped this season to challenge Crumlin Starrsquos stranglehold on the premier title..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sharon stars on Angela’s day  ","story":"LADY luck shone down on Angela Kenmore for her Lady Captainrsquos Day at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club on Saturday.A welcome window in the weather meant that the ladies escaped the dayrsquos frequent deluges and almost miraculously went round rain free.Heavy showers early in the morning had put the competition under threat and the afternoon downpours meant that Mrs Kenmorersquos male guests got a soaking.But not aof rain fell on the ladies, who also had the benefit of not having to play out of the water-logged bunkers.Despite the weather prediction, there was a great turnout and a thrilling finish.Sharon Heaney and Anne Teggart finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with  points, but it was Sharon who took the Lady Captainrsquos prize thanks to a better back nine.With Anne having to settle for the runners-up spot, third place went to Patricia McCormick, who came in with  points.The prize for the best gross went to Caitlin Burke who beat Twyla Gibson on the better back nine after they both ed a score of .The front nine prize went to Mary Rice with  points and Orlagh Carson won the back nine prize with  points.Anne Savage won the past lady captainsrsquo prize with  points and Alison Rooney won the committee prize with  points.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Margaret Willis , Caitlin Burke , Jackie Elliottand Patricia McCormick .Gerry Gray won the lady guestsrsquo prize with  points and Brendan Mullen won the male guestsrsquo prize with  points.The Lady Captainrsquos mixed greensomes competition on Thursday was won by vice-captain Robert McCausland and past lady captain Eileen Mullen with  points mdash one point better than runners-up Ryan Teggart and Carmel Hanvey.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Anne Tumeltyand John Passmore ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Taking porridge and exercise are Roddy’s secrets to long life  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new centenarian, Roderick Maguire, says his secret to a long le is his daily bowl of porridge.The former master painter says he still has porridge every morning which he makes for himself at his Thomas Russell Park home.Mr Maguire, better known as Roddy, turned  nearly two weeks ago on August .He received the customary congratulatory card from the Queen as well as a letter from Irish President Michael DHiggins and euro, mdash a special financial bounty known as the Centenarian award.Mr Maguire was treated to a special reception in St Patrickrsquos Church after parish priest Fr John Murray said a special mass for him on his birthday.His family gathered at Quoile Bistro the next night to have a family reunion, which included children and grandchildren who travelled over from Doncaster in England.With his first we Betty, who sadly died many years ago, he had four children mdash Rory, Joan, Anne and Niall.

Merkel has told Prime Minister Boris Johnson he has  days to come up with an alternative solution to replace the Irish backstop.Mr Johnson called her timetable “blistering”, but said he was “more than happy” with her proposal to speed-up the talks.The Conservative Party leader arrived in Berlin yesterday to kick-start talks to find an alternative to the Irish backstop – a contingency measure negotiated by his predecessor Theresa May to get an exit deal over the line.Mr Johnson, in a letter this week to European Council President Donald Tusk, said Britain would leave without a deal unless the “anti-democratic” backstop – voted down three times by MPs in Parliament – was removed from the Withdrawal Agreement..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget

.fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The backstop was a stop-gap measure agreed by Mrs May in an attempt to prevent a hard border being reinstalled in Northern Ireland, a move that would have tied the UK to European Union rules until a solution was found.Mrs Merkel, in a statement in the Chancellery, said the backstop had always been a “fallback position” and would only come into effectno other solution could be agreed that would protect the “integrity of the single market”.In an attempt to have a backstop solution in place before the October  Brexit deadline, the German leader said she wanted a new arrangement agreed within  days.She said: “If one is able to solve this conundrum,one finds this solution, we said we would probably find it in the next two years to come but we can also maybe find it in the next  days to come.“Then we are one step further in the right direction and we have to obviously put our all into this.”Mr Johnson said he was “more than happy” with the timetable proposed by his German counterpart.“I must say I am very glad listening to you tonight Angela to hear that at least the conversations that matter can now properly begin,” he said.“You have set a very blistering timetable of  days –I understood you correctly, I am more than happy with that.”A Downing Street source said the government was happy with the tone of Mrs Merkel’s exchange.Secretary of State urged to ditch victims’ commissioner Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The government was not briefed beforehand that Mrs Merkel would apply the “pressure” of a -day deadline, but Mr Johnson’s team is hopeful it is an indication that European leaders are preparing to renegotiate – an outcome the EU has previously ruled out.Mr Johnson told Mrs Merkel that the backstop would have to go as part of further discussions – or  Britain was prepared to leave without a deal.He said the backstop would need to be removed “whole and entire” before a deal could be reached.But Mr Johnson, on his first trip to Germany as PM, said he was optimistic an agreement could be struck.He is due to travel to France today to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris to hold similar discussions.try catch  TrendingThese are all the mobile speed camera

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management.

Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.
