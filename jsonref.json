Narendra Modi taking part in a yoga session to mark International Yoga Day in DehradunNarendra joined the BJP in 1987 and soon became the General Secretary of the Gujarat branch, influential in ensuring that the party’s presence was strong in the following years. Three years after joining, he participated in a coalition government and helped to achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections.Despite the BJP’s control over the Indian government being short-lived, only lasting a few months in 1996, Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organisation in New Delhi and three years later, appointed the General Secretary.However, because of fellow BJP member and Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel’s poor response to the Bhuj earthquake in 2000, that killed more than 20,000 people, Modi replaced him and went on to enter his first-ever electoral contest in February 2002, which he went on to win and take a seat in the state assembly.Modi’s political career was then marred with controversy and scandal: his role during the Gujarat riots in 2002 were questioned and he was accused of condoning violence, or at least, not doing enough to stop the killing of over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.          Theresa May and Narendra Modi arrive for a photograph ahead of the India-U.K. Tech SummitIn 2005, the US declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for these riots and the UK also criticised him for this. While Modi escaped without any indictment, his close associates were found guilty of complicity and were jailed.His government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings: one case resulting the deaths of a woman and three men, members of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, involved in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.Modi was soon indispensable to the BJP and under his leadership, the party secured victory in 2002 after winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber and again in 2007 before prevailing again in 2012. Both times he won his contests and returned as Chief Minister.          Justin Trudeau, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Narendra Modi poseModi speechIn Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, he hailed India’s rise under his government and said that ‘policy paralysis’ during the UPA rule was over, according to The Times of India. From the Red Fort, Modi spent 88 minutes addressing his nation and explored burning issues.‘When 125 crore people move towards achieving a goal, there is nothing that cannot happen. In 2014, the people of the country did not just stop at forming the government. They moved together towards nation-building and are contributing to do so.’After showcasing his achievements, he stated that ‘India was earlier a sleeping elephant which has woken up now and started running’ and went on to quote Tamil nationalist icon Subramania Bharti to say in Tamil, ‘India will show the path to the world.‘I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient for my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is based on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT skills. I am impatient for my county to lead it.’          Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Deputy L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi picturedHe also announced the rollout of the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Scheme, which has been described as the world’s largest healthcare measure and will cover 500 million people, providing a cover of 500,000 rupees (£5,600) per family a year.In addition to discussing the commissioning of women in the armed forces, he spoke about the recent incidents of rape, but made no mention of the hot topic being debated in this country at the moment of lynching.Modi also promised that he would send a manned flight into space by 2022 and become the fourth country to achieve this. India is currently the sixth-largest economy in the world and Modi said that international institutions will see the subcontinent as as engine to strengthen the world economy for the next three decades.He will seek another five-year term for his party at elections due by March-April next year.Narendra Modi net worthWhile Narendra Modi may be the leader of the sixth-largest economy in the world, he only keeps a measly Rs 4,700 (£55) as cash in hand.His total assets are worth Rs 14 million (£16,000) because of a property he owns in Gandhinagar, the value of which has increased by more than 25 times since it was purchased 13 years ago, according to Mashable.He does not own any vehicles, aircrafts, yachts or ships and while he has no loans, Modi owns four gold rings, which are worth Rs 1,19,000 (£1380). It was also revealed that he was one of the most modestly-paid world leaders and earned a salary of Rs 1.9 million (£24,000).Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

They had insisted Stokes protected them from verbal abuse.Stokes, who had admitted drinking heavily but denied being \u0027really very drunk\u0027 had insisted in court: \u0027Everything I did that night, I did in defence of myself.\u0027He said he had acted to protect Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor from homophobic abuse.          Following his acquittal Stokes was immediately restored to the England squad for Saturday’s Test against IndiaNottinghamshire batsman Hales, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with attempting to calm the ruckus until footage of him \u0027stamping\u0027 on Mr Ali emerged in evidence. In police bodycam footage of Stokes\u0027 arrest, Hales appeared to lie to PC Stacey Alway, claiming he had missed the fight.Despite the severity of the violence he allegedly used, and his apparent lies to police, Hales was not arrested or charged, merely interviewed under caution.In his closing speech, Stokes\u0027 barrister Gordon Cole QC went as far as to suggest that Hales could have been responsible for Mr Ali\u0027s injuries, which included a fractured eye socket. The CPS said it was an Avon and Somerset Police decision not to pursue Hales.On the morning the trial began, prosecutors sought to lay two additional, more serious charges against Stokes to reflect the injuries suffered by Mr Hale and Mr Ali. But Judge Peter Blair QC said introducing the counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail, would be unfair on Stokes and his legal team at such a late stage. The decision  is under scrutiny following the last-minute attempt to introduce the extra charges and the acquittal of Mr Hale halfway through the trial.Jurors may have been baffled by the absence of Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, who maintain that Stokes defended them against homophobic abuse. Sources said the CPS deemed them unreliable.As the jury, who deliberated for two hours and 34 minutes, announced the not guilty verdicts, Stokes\u0027 chest heaved and he staggered forward, tears welling in his eyes, before he shook Mr Ali\u0027s hand. In the public gallery, Stokes\u0027 wife Clare wept and embraced his agent Neil Fairbrother.Outside court, Mr Stokes\u0027 solicitor Paul Lunt told reporters: \u0027Today\u0027s verdict represents the end of an 11-month ordeal for Ben during which time he has had to maintain his silence at times when many on social media, and certain parts of the Press, predetermined his guilt long before the trial began.\u0027The jury\u0027s decision ... fairly reflects the truth of what happened in Bristol that night.\u0027A CPS spokesman said: \u0027A decision to charge this case was made following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. We respect the jury\u0027s decision. The CPS keeps cases under continual review.\u0027We selected the charge of affray at the outset in accordance with the Code. Upon further review we considered that additional assault charges would be appropriate.\u0027Avon and Somerset Police said: \u0027Early investigative advice was sought from the CPS in relation to Alex Hales\u0027 involvement in the incident and a decision was subsequently made at a senior level to take no further action against him "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/13/4F22FD7D00000578-6067031-image-m-151_1534421451506.jpg","title":"Gordon Ramsay congratulates twins level success","story":"    Gordon Ramsay posted this picture and message about his twins Jack and Holly on InstagramRamsay, who also has a 16-year-old daughter called Tilly with his wife Tana, 43, said in the post today: \u0027Well done Jack and Holly! \u0027Two more Ramsays off to university.\u0027Exeter (and) Ravensbourne.

CIA Director John Brennan testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingJohn Brennan CIABrennan served with the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) before working for the State Department as a Political Officer at the US Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and went on to direct terrorism analysis at the Director of Central Intelligence’s Counterterrorism Center in the 1990s.According to Britannica, he then acted as the CIA’s daily intelligence briefer under former President Bill Clinton before serving as the agency’s chief of station in Saudi Arabia, as Chief of Staff to CIA Director George Tenet and the CIA’s Deputy Executive Director.Before retiring from the CIA in 2005, he led efforts for the formation of an organisation that would become the National Counterterrorism Centre and was an interim director. Brennan then took on a role as President and CEO of the Analysis Corporation and Chairman of the Board at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, but this was short-lived.Following this, while former President Barack Obama found that he shared similar philosophies when it came to the CIA, Brennan’s involvement in enhanced interrogation techniques working under President George W. Bush, he was not appointed as head of the agency.          President Barack Obama and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, listen to John BrennanInstead, Brennan was made Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and Cyberattacks for around four years and in this role, helped to share US policy in response to a number of different events.He also oversaw the CIA’s use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, that were used to target terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. However, this and his involvement in methods such as waterboarding during the Bush era were called into question with Obama nominated him to lead the CIA in 2013.Brennan said that he was against waterboarding and despite this, his appointment was approved by the Senate 63-34. As reported by Reuters, during his tenure, Brennan created ten new mission centres so that the CIA could focus on cyberthreats.In 2017, he also briefed Trump, along with James Comey, Mike Rogers and James Clapper, on the findings in regards to Russian election interference and the allegations contained in the Steele dossier, as reported by CBS News.Before he left office, Brennan was open about how he felt about the current US President and said: ‘I don\u0027t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia\u0027s intentions and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. Brennan stated that it was outrageous that Trump was equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany”.’John Brennan is married to Kathy Pokluda Brennan, also of North Bergen and is the father of a son and twin daughters.John Brennan on TrumpJohn Brennan hit back at Trump after he ordered that his security clearance should be revoked and wrote that the President’s campaign had colluded with Moscow to win in the 2016 election. Trump said that this decision was made because of Brennan’s ‘erratic conduct’ and ‘outrageous allegations’, according to the BBC. Trump cited that the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election was the reason why Brennan’s clearance was revoked.However, in the NYT piece that Brennan wrote, he said that his clearance was a politically motivated ‘attempt to scare into silence’ other critics of the President. He continued: ‘Mr Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.’Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

The marriage broke down in 1972 and matters soon became acrimonious. Up to his eyeballs in debt, Lord Lucan became obsessed with getting his children back.Lady Lucan was the only known witness to the events in 1974 which led to the murder of the children’s nanny, Sandra Rivett. Lady Lucan always maintained that it was her estranged husband who bludgeoned the nanny to death, a case of mistaken identity.Lord Lucan, she said, hit her four times with a length of bandaged metal piping before she managed to escape and raise the alarm at a local pub, bursting through the door of the Plumber’s Arms screaming: “Help me, help me! I have just escaped from a murderer. My children, my children. He’s in my house. He’s murdered the nanny. Help me!”He disappeared almost immediately, his borrowed car found abandoned and blood-spattered at the cross-Channel port of Newhaven in East Sussex. On the way he stopped off to tell a friend, Susan Maxwell-Scott, that he had stumbled on an attacker hitting his wife and had tried to save her. Lucan said he was going to “lie doggo” for a while.What followed was one of the most bizarre missing person cases there has ever been. Over the years there were reported sightings of him working as a waiter in San Francisco, at a clinic for alcoholics in Brisbane, living rough in a Land Rover in the rural outback of New Zealand’s North Island with a menagerie of pets including a cat, goat and possum.In 2003 the Sunday  published claims by a former Scotland Yard detective that Lucan had been living in a hippy commune in Goa and was known to friends as Jungle Barry. Days later the  reported the truth: Jungle Barry was in fact a now deceased folk singer from St Helens.If Lucan were to still be alive, he would be 83.Lady Lucan was found dead at her home in Eaton Row, near Buckingham Palace, last September. An inquest ruled that she had taken her own life in the mistaken belief she had Parkinson’s disease.For decades Lady Lucan cut a lonely, tortured figure, severing ties with her children and their families in the 1980s. In her will she expressed her wish to leave her estate to the homeless and housing charity Shelter.Shelter will benefit from the sale at Bonhams of 40 objects from Lady Lucan’s house including a 1972 portrait of her husband by artist Dominick Elwes.Observers have found it curious that Lady Lucan appeared less bitter towards her husband than her children. In one rare interview, to the Sunday Times in 1998, the journalist remarked on how the Elwes portrait dominated the drawing room along with a display of silver cups Lord Lucan won at the Clermont Club backgammon tournaments.The portrait, with an estimate of £2,000-£3,000, is layered with extra poignancy in that Elwes, one of Lucan’s closest friends from their Eton schooldays, killed himself in 1975. Elwes had been shunned by Lucan’s friends for selling a drawing of them to the Sunday Times.Charlie Thomas, Bonhams director of private sales, said the Lucan name resonated throughout history with the 3rd earl, for example, giving the order to deploy the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. “These items offer a rare chance to acquire pieces belonging to one of this country’s most famous aristocratic families.”Other objects in the 3 October sale include a backgammon trophy with an estimate of £200-£300 and a Victorian silver cigar box engraved with B - for Bingham - with an estimate of £700-£900.There are also boxes of books including, with perhaps morbid irony, Graham Greene’s novel The End of the Affair and his short story collection May We Borrow Your Husband?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e3bcf4c623b5e4266790080db02bc17662e6847/0_592_2362_1416/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a1006225f6f5f483d9bbfca569b4713","title":"wendy mcmurdo best photograph girl bears museum","story":"‘The children kept asking the attendant: Are the bears alive or dead?’ I have always been interested in childhood and play, that unguarded space of imagination and reverie that children access so easily. In the 1990s, I started thinking about how children were engaging with gaming and the internet, which were still embryonic. So when I moved back to Edinburgh from London, I set about exploring how digital learning was being used in schools.The more time I spent in schools, the more I saw what children were actually doing. One of those things was museum visits – and it was clear that digital culture was greatly affecting museums too. So I spent a year trailing school parties taking guided tours around the Royal Museums of Scotland. I would secrete myself in a corner with my lights – this was in the days before cordless equipment – and shoot large groups quickly, then in post-production isolate single children. Here, you can see a split reflection of two girls in the vitrine, but only one of them actually looking.The memories you have of going to a museum are not of your classmates, they are of the objects. I remember the children speaking to the guards, often asking them: “Is it alive or is it dead?” They were five or six years old. The guard would hesitate, saying: “Well, it was alive and now it’s dead.” I can relate to that sense of anxiety. Even now at the zoo, if I’m standing too close to the lion enclosure, I feel nervous. It just appears too open, even though you know the animals cannot get out.The vitrines became a really important part of all the images. This one was an amazing display case in a Victorian gallery, with a glass cupola that gave beautiful overhead light. I remember visiting it myself as a child. On the other side of the bears, there was a Bengal tiger. We would line up to sit down on our little padded seats, inches away from this huge creature. Being in such close proximity to something like that was a strange, memorable experience. And that inidual experience is what I wanted to capture: a child engaging with something much larger than itself.These Victorian displays and dioramas were often quite ferocious and bloody, with animals ripping out each other’s gizzards. That kind of containment of emotion or feeling is a gift for a photographer.The children loved the bears and the birds most. There’s another image of an owl swooping on a taxidermied mouse with a little boy looking out to the camera in front of the case. And another of an impossibly huge albatross in a beautiful sculpted case. The images that worked best were those that played with scale: a very small child engaging with a very large object.I was thinking about children’s engagement with the outside world, especially in the face of the rapidly evolving culture of gaming and the screen. When I was that age, the museum was the place where everything important was held. Now with the internet, that is very different. If a child wants to learn about something, they don’t naturally go to the museum. They go online.This gallery no longer exists. Some of the objects have been brought out, cleaned up and displayed elsewhere, freed from the glass cases. Going back 20 years on, it’s like seeing old friends.Wendy McMurdo is in the group show In Focus: Scottish Photography at City Art Centre – which is part of this year’s Edinburgh Art Festival – until 26 AugustBorn: Edinburgh, 1962.Training: Edinburgh College of Art, Pratt Institute, Goldsmiths, University of London.Influences: “Lee Miller, Man Ray, Susan Hiller, Marina Warner, Sarah Charlesworth, Valérie Belin, Martin Scorsese, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.” High point: “Having my first British Council touring show and beginning to see the work go out into the world.

Access to both warehouses continued to be closed on Thursday as the dispute remained unresolved.A source close to Sports Direct said it had been forced to cancel orders as XPO was being “totally unreasonable in terms of their demands” and was “refusing to engage in any process” which would “move the situation forward”.“XPO is trying to hold us to ransom,” the source said.It is understood that XPO has blocked suppliers and Sports Direct from entering the warehouses. XPO was not available for comment.Some fashion suppliers have taken action while negotiations over payments continue. Jigsaw has removed stock from 20 stores, and brands including Karen Millen and Mint Velvet are also understood to have withdrawn some stock. These brands run concessions in House of Fraser store and so own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct’s purchase.One concession operator said it was continuing to operate as it hoped a deal could be agreed. “We have been getting paid since Friday and are meeting people from House of Fraser next week,” the operator said.Sports Direct has no legal obligation to pay suppliers money owed before its buyout as their debts were part of the administration. No supplier debts are expected to be paid from the administrators as virtually all the proceeds from Sports Direct’s buyout are going to its banks and bondholders. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of the debts in the interest of good relations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f11e3879c80ab42bd2ad793014c2bb85e91308d4/16_103_1296_777/master/1296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076a47789c026ce9a5f63f8b04220c9f","title":"could greening every paris schoolyard cool the city","story":"Playground oases could benefit students and city alike, but will making them public prove too controversial in a city on high alert?It’s only 10am but the heat is already radiating off the asphalt at the École Riblette, a primary school on the outskirts of Paris. Sébastien Maire, the city’s chief resilience officer, points to the school’s lower courtyard, a classic heat trap: surrounded by concrete walls that reflect sunlight inside. Last June, the courtyard hit 55C (131F).“For three days, school activities stopped,” Maire says. “It was not possible for the children to study, nor to go into the schoolyard. We would forbid them because it’s 55 degrees – you can fry an egg on the ground.”Maire explains how the courtyards at this school will be transformed: a green wall here, a vegetable planter there, expanded areas of shade and special drainable concrete surfaces that can absorb water when it rains. If all goes to plan, all of Paris’s 800 schools will be transformed into green spaces by 2040. The City of Paris plan is also being facilitated by 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a project of the Rockefeller Foundation, which also supports  Cities. But if the trees and planters are uncontroversial, the next two steps of the scheme could prove more difficult for the city to sell. Maire first wants to open up these newly built green spaces to vulnerable people during heatwaves, and eventually wants the general public to enjoy them too – albeit outside school hours.“By 2050, we’ll have 800 cool spots in the city using school infrastructure,” he says, arguing that it is a better alternative than taking vulnerable people to supermarkets and churches. In Paris, which has the highest population density in Europe, no one lives more than 200 metres from a school, meaning the plan could dramatically increase access to green space for many residents.Lina Liakou, the regional director for Europe at 100RC, says of the new green spaces: “They don’t just address the environmental challenges, but also improve social cohesion and create a better environment for the people around them.”That holistic approach stemmed from an 18-month resilience-building process that the city underwent in collaboration with 100RC, attempting to think in a more interconnected way – not just focusing on climate after the Paris Agreement, but also “the social and inclusion issues that have so clearly impacted the city”, says Andrew Brenner, associate director of global communications at 100RC. “The fact that the city is looking at the oases as not climate interventions – tackling a singular challenge, in this case heat – but rather resilience interventions with multiple benefits, and elaborating that from the start, is a huge development.” Still, opening up Paris’s fortress-like schools to everyone is not an easy pitch in a city that remains on high alert. Terror attacks have killed 150 people since 2015. Heightened security measures make it difficult even for parents to access schools. Liakou says this part of the project has not yet been finalised. “It’s a challenge for the city of Paris, and we want to work with them and pressure them more,” she says.Maire is undeterred. He says the spaces will be kept safe and clean, and says no one will force a school to open its doors to the public if parents and teachers don’t agree to it.He points out that heatwaves have killed many more people in France than terrorism has: 580 people died in a single week of heat last year, and the European heatwave of 2003 killed 14,800. Maire also argues that bringing people together in school grounds is an essential part of making Paris more resilient to terrorism – setting himself in stark opposition to the French state.“They have been forbidding people to organise small things together because of terrorism: ‘You shouldn’t convene, you shouldn’t meet together, you’re going to be targets, so stay at home,’” Maire says. “But the resilient vision says, ‘If a crazy guy wants to commit something, we won’t be able to prevent it. Stop lying to the people.’”“Our concern is much more how society can face this and bounce back afterwards. What is the way? To know your neighbour, to do things with people. Not to be alone in front of your TV scared by terrorism, but to convene.” As for whether increasing green cover in schools can actually bring down temperatures across Paris, it’s still unclear. There is some evidence that making Paris greener can cool the city. In 2012, researchers from the French weather service simulated the 2003 heatwave against a number of adaptation scenarios. They found that turning every bit of bare land in the city of Paris into green space, including half of all pavements wider than 15 metres, could bring heatwave temperatures down by three to five degrees during the day.But that’s only if more than a thousand hectares of land turn green in the next few decades. Together, Paris’s schoolyards comprise just 80 hectares, and they won’t go completely green: École Riblette is keeping two of its yards asphalted so students can play sport.“Vegetation in schools is one step towards putting more vegetation in the city, which could have an overall microclimate effect and cool the entire city,” says Vincent Viguié, a research scientist at the International Research Centre on the Environment and Development. But he warns that even the best-case scenario isn’t good enough to take on Paris’s rapidly warming climate. “It’s nice, but it’s not sufficient.”Virué also points out that drainable concrete surfaces like the one proposed for École Riblette are less effective than grass lawns, which would reflect heat outwards instead of absorbing it. “When there is a heatwave, it doesn’t rain,” he says. “So to have porous bitumen doesn’t have such a big effect to cool the air.”In another pilot school for the project, heat sensors will be embedded in the ground to measure how the new surfaces respond to heatwaves.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085f5536e7b77683a73e44a71637afcb9ddfc1da/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deeec330f9b81d247e5ddbbda7b469c2","title":"jeremy corbyn critics speech labour leader","story":"Labour’s leader should own his mistakes – but he has been on the right side of history more often than many of his criticsOn 18 March 2008, during a media feeding frenzy about statements made by his radical Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, presidential hopeful Barack Obama gave a speech in Philadelphia. His aim was to lay out his candidacy and experiences within the context of America’s racial history. Jeremy Corbyn needs to make a similar intervention over accusations of antisemitism. This is the speech he should, and could, give.For as long as I can remember, anti-racism and internationalism have been a central part of my life. My parents met at a rally supporting Spanish Republicans who were fighting General Franco’s fascists – a crucial episode in the spread of fascism across Europe that saw Hitler’s rise and all the carnage that came with it. My politics were shaped by a leftwing tradition that had a clear notion that injustice could not be tolerated – and that principle was as crucial to defend abroad as it was at home.So to be branded an antisemite – and the leader of an antisemitic party – after five decades of political activism is something I have had to take seriously, even as I have found it deeply distressing personally.Antisemitism has a long, vile and violent history, not least in this country and this continent, where Jews were all too recently threatened with being extinguished as a people. Accusations of antisemitism should never be dismissed summarily, cavalierly or defensively – it is far too serious a matter for that. Such accusations should not be made opportunistically, baselessly or for crude political gain, either – it is far too serious a matter for that, too. Antisemitism is an evil in itself. Its gravity does not hinge on whether the accuser or the accused is Labour or Tory, Jew or gentile, Old Labour or New.The left has an impressive history of fighting bigotry and racism in all its forms, and I am proud to have dedicated a significant section of my life to that struggle. I make no apology for that. It has been a struggle conducted both in parliament, where I was one of a handful of MPs who opposed the hostile environment policy that led to the ill-treatment of the Windrush generation, and in the streets, demonstrating with the Anti-Nazi League against the far right and neo-Nazis during the 1970s and beyond.The left has a proud record of internationalism and I am proud to have dedicated a significant part of my political life to that also. I protested against Saddam Hussein’s gassing of the Kurds in 1988 while the Tory government endorsed selling him weapons I marched against the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 when the Labour government joined the US. I was arrested for protesting against apartheid in 1984 when the British government still branded Nelson Mandela a terrorist. I supported dialogue between Sinn Féin and the British state, a strategy that led to peace, while our government sought military victory, which escalated the conflict.I make no apology for this either, even when there have been overtures I have made to groups or iniduals that, when orced from their historical context, appear unwise. Politics is about hard choices. You don’t make peace with your friends but with your enemies. I have been on the right side of history far more often than I have not been – and certainly far more often than those who seek to sully my name by distorting my past.There is no contradiction in being a committed anti-racist and an internationalist – indeed they come from exactly the same belief: that everybody should be treated equally, that our human rights are inisible and that discriminating against people is wrong, whoever you are and wherever you are. But there is a specific challenge when it comes to Israel and Palestine as it relates to antisemitism and British Jewry.There is no shortage of people, on every side of the Middle East conflict, who have blood on their hands. But it is my sincere belief that it is not a conflict between equals. Israel is a regional superpower backed by the west and armed to the teeth that occupies the West Bank and is building settlements on Palestinian land, in defiance of international law. It recently passed a law that makes Israeli-Arabs second-class citizens. Like most people in Britain and around the world we support the Palestinian right to create their own state.British Jews are not homogeneous. They have a range of views on everything, including the Middle East. That said – and for understandable reasons, particularly relating to the Holocaust – even though many British Jews are critical of Israeli policies, the vast majority feel a close affinity with the country.So my history of pro-Palestinian activism, which I have always been very open about, is a source of legitimate tension with many British Jews. Reasonable people can disagree on both the origins and the potential solutions to the conflict in the Middle East – that disagreement does not make either me or the Labour party antisemitic.The challenge has come in navigating that tension with sensitivity while establishing a clear, coherent and robust distinction between criticising Israel and criticising Jews. Over the last few years it has become painfully clear to me that some on the left have not always risen to that challenge.The left in general, and Labour in particular, does not have the antisemitism problem that many in the media and the political class accuse us of having. There is no poll or survey that supports the notion that antisemitism is rife on the left or, indeed, any worse than it is among Conservatives.Yet we do have a problem. Antisemitism is a hardy virus and it would be a grave mistake to assume that we are somehow immune from it. There are some on the left who seek to hold Jews accountable for what Israel does. That is wrong. Some believe that because Jews are overwhelmingly white and some are wealthy, antisemitism is somehow less worthy of our concern than other forms of discrimination. They are wrong. Some believe that because so many of the attacks on Labour under my leadership have been baseless that all\u0026nbspof these accusations are baseless. They are wrong. In the words of the great African-American writer and activist WEB Du Bois: “Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in.”I take responsibility for this. When accusations have been made we have, at times, been too slow to respond or have responded evasively. We could have worked harder to engage with Jewish communities. It makes me cringe to know that, on a handful of occasions, I shared platforms with people who have made reprehensible statements and failed to challenge antisemitic remarks others have made in my presence. On at least one occasion I failed to recognise what I now see were clear antisemitic tropes in a mural. I deeply regret the offence this has caused. There are many things I am attacked for having done that I make no apology for. But these apologies I own. They were my mistakes. And the apology comes not from a point of weakness but strength because I can do better.The Labour party isn’t perfect. But it’s still the party of justice, equality and inclusion. It’s the party that has sent more women, black, Asian and Muslim MPs to parliament than any other. It’s the party that introduced the first Race Relations Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation and commissioned the Macpherson report. That is our history. That is our tradition. Those are not only our founding principles but our guiding principles. And that will be our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ce67573b1e40e0f1009c325a357a50565d138f/0_232_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f4fb3c83f7225349bc8f3836ce83b4","title":"railway fares rise privatisation commuters passengers","story":"The unmitigated failure of privatised railways is plain for all to see and passengers are the victimsRailways signal the state of a nation. Fast, clean, cheap, punctual trains make a country look well run: Mussolini and Hitler knew the potency of “making the trains run on time”. Any prime minister who puts Chris Grayling in charge, an ideological obsessive who destroys all he touches, is tone deaf to the national pulse.To make the point, one protester bought a car, taxed it, filled it with petrol and travelled from Bristol to Crouch End for less than the £218 full train fare, with £11 left over for lunch. People are spending one-fifth and more of their disposable incomes on season tickets, so these fare rises up-end super-fine calculations on the lower cost of a mortgage balanced against rising train fares with every mile travelled from centres of work. The missing ingredient is a reminder to business, forever whingeing about taxes, that unless the state carries their staff to work, low pay doesn’t cover fares. Dishonestly, the government uses the higher retail prices index to raise regulated fares and student loans, an index the Treasury and Bank of England declare “flawed” and “useless”, yet conveniently choose the lower consumer price index to keep pension and benefit rises low.Companies can spend £60m a year just to bid for franchises. That’s an administrative madness that far outstrips the old rightwing complaint against British Rail that it was a bureaucratic monolith synonymous with state-owned, shabby, producer-captured sluggishness. John Major may be a revered anti-Brexit hero now, but it was his personal ideological fixation that dreamed up dashing liveries for different companies, which he imagined steaming away in hot competition embodying the free market. But there’s precious little competition – instead passengers are stuck with empty choices.Meanwhile Network Rail scavenges for cash with a £1.5bn sell-off of railway arches harbouring 4,455 age-old businesses alongside new start-ups, going against every ethos of a state-owned company.Is nationalisation a magic bullet train? There are risks: will the Treasury invest enough or, as before, keep cutting back on capital? Will the unions hold more sway than passengers? The same basic dilemmas will remain – how much should the state spend on a minority mode of transport, when cars and buses take most people to work? Council funding for buses has halved since 2010, and 3,000 vital services have been cut. Three-quarters of goods travel by road, not rail.Can Labour for the first time offer a genuinely integrated transport system where at last everything links up? Imagining joined-up trains, buses, trams and bike-routes has been beyond all transport secretaries. Right now, no one is in charge, and that goes for virtually every department in Theresa May’s paralysed, swinging-in-the-wind regime.Trains do signify the fitness of a government. If an incoming Labour government concentrates hard on making trains run on time at fair fares, that would be a potent signal of all-round efficiency worth investing in heavily. But what perplexes me is the passivity of train-travelling commuters, among the most well-heeled, empowered of citizens. Yet apart from a minor kicking down of a gate in St Albans during the worst of the timetabling disaster, they fail to rebel. Along Southern’s lines, passing through nothing but top Tory MPs’ constituencies, passengers tolerate years of strikes and disruption, with more to come. Why aren’t they taking direct action, voting out their MPs and super-gluing ticket barriers? Ah, I forgot. The private companies get paid regardless of ticket income: only the state loses if people refuse to pay, another brilliant bit of contracting in these failed franchises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495be7cc8998840d67fe69cc892f561277a83d84/59_253_3323_1993/master/3323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fce4ca0e14ccf35ea1a1423a64bf47d","title":"a level results raise policy questions but first lets recognise achievement","story":"Despite the upheaval of the redesigned qualifications, many trends persistWe all know coverage of exam results day is fairly formulaic. Pictures of teenagers jumping up in the air clutching pieces of paper, stories about twins with a string of A*s who are now off to Cambridge, and a parade of people trying to explain all the changes that have happened that year and how it is now all different to before.Students receiving their A-level results on Thursday will be the first to do so in the latest wave of redesigned qualifications in England. The changes, which began during Michael Gove’s tenure at the Department for Education, mean a move away from modular qualifications and coursework towards linear assessment at the end of two years of study – largely through examinations.This year, subjects such as geography, modern foreign languages and music join the likes of English, the sciences, and art and design in being assessed in this way. The new qualifications are designed to better meet the needs of universities and employers.Despite the changes, many of the trends that we have seen in recent years persist. Girls continue to outperform boys in most subjects, the notable exceptions being mathematics and chemistry. There are large disparities in entry rates, around four-fifths of entries to physics are from boys, in English literature just one-fifth are.For many students, results day will be less about reflecting on what they have achieved and more about determining what happens next – whether they go to university, which university they will attend, and which course they will take. But for a growing number of students that uncertainty was removed long before they opened their results.This inevitably raised concerns that without the incentive of meeting a university offer, some students may not strive for the highest grades possible. That may well have happened in some cases, but at a national level the proportion of entrants achieving an A* or A is largely unchanged, although there has been a slight dip in the very highest grade. It does however, raise questions about how our universities admissions system should operate.But overall these are concerns for policymakers.

Burning wood before it has been properly dried releases more of the damaging particulates that contribute to air pollution.The government will also tighten standards on solid fuels, forcing manufacturers to cut down on sulphur emissions and ensure only the cleanest stoves are sold.The government believes the proposals will prevent 8,000 tonnes of harmful particulates entering the atmosphere each year.The clean air strategy is a response to an EU directive on cutting harmful emissions. As well as stricter rules on wood burning, it included separate plans to reduce emissions of ammonia from farms and dust from vehicle tyres and brakes.When the draft clean air strategy was published in May, Labour described it as “hugely disappointing”.The health costs of toxic air are estimated at £20bn a year by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.The new rules are the latest example of Gove’s interventionist approach to tackling environmental challenges, which has included proposed bans on cotton buds and plastic straws.The environment secretary’s attempt to restrict the use of polluting fuels were recently ridiculed by Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who joked in a speech about regulations on “wood-burning Goves”.Truss, who co-founded the liberal Tory thinktank Freer, said: “Government’s role should not be to tell us what our tastes should be. Too often we’re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves – I mean stoves.“I can see their point: there’s enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.”The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has suggested that he could go further than Gove and ban wood-burning stoves altogether in the capital.Areeba Hamid, of Greenpeace’s clean air campaign, said: “Limiting the use of wood-burning stoves will help reduce harmful particulate pollution but it is only one part of solving the air pollution crisis.“Transport, in particular diesel vehicles, is responsible for the majority of air pollution on our streets and unless they are tackled as a priority, we cannot expect dramatic improvements in the UK’s air quality.”She called for the introduction of clean air zones across the country and the phasing out of the internal combustion engine by 2030.Gove, who campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, has repeatedly insisted that leaving the EU will not mean dismantling Britain’s environmental standards.Unlike his pro-leave colleagues David Davis and Boris Johnson, he has chosen to accept Theresa May’s Chequers strategy. Gove has staunchly defended the prime minister’s approach, which proposes a “common rulebook” for key export industries, including agrifoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72ed91145ebaeb93f4760692935077c851ce3db3/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e137b93cb8a9dc8f2868465c46a434","title":"la liga us deal 39th game premier league","story":"“I have a cupboard full of models as to how it could and couldn’t work,” Richard Scudamore said in 2008. Thankfully for the Premier League, the contents of its executive chairman’s cupboard were never fully revealed as plans to stage a 39th game in Asia or Australia were quickly consigned to history amid criticism from, among many others, Sir Alex Ferguson to Sepp Blatter.The announcement that La\u0026nbspLiga plans to host regular-season games in the United States as part of a 15-year partnership will, for many supporters, have brought back bad memories of the ill-conceived 39th\u0026nbspstep reportedly hatched by Scudamore and Rupert Murdoch’s associate Sir Rod Eddington. But while fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief for now, the chairman of Relevent – the American firm that has won the right to stage one Spanish league match thousands of miles from home every season until 2033 – has not ruled out a similar move in future.“We have always stated that we would love to have a Premier League game here but it never got beyond the boardroom,” says Charlie Stillitano. “It’s one of the things that we have talked to them about over the years. If something like the 39th game ever got off the ground, we would put ourselves forward for it.”Together with the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, Stillitano has been the driving force behind Relevent’s attempts to build on the burgeoning market for the beautiful game in the US over the past decade. The latest edition of their International Champions Cup brainchild has seen 18 teams playing a series of pre-season friendlies spread over 22 venues but the new venture – described by La Liga as “an inflection point for soccer in the US and Canada” – represents a major breakthrough that could have major implications for the game as a whole.“It’s something we have been working on for the past year and a half. A lot of leagues are looking to catch up with the Premier League and Spain is trying to make its mark,” says Stillitano. “This is a bold move for La Liga but it shows their ambition. A lot of leagues talk but these guys have really put themselves out there because they think this is the best way to build their brand.”Yet within hours of the announcement on Thursday the critics were queueing up. David Aganzo, the president of the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE), strongly objected to the prospect of its members being asked to fly long-haul to play a regular-season match. “As per usual, La Liga has dispensed with the opinions of the players and has undertaken actions that only benefit them, regardless of the health or risks to the players, and even less the feelings of the following masses of the clubs who are being forced to compete in North America once a season,” he said in a statement. “Footballers are not currency that can be used in business to only benefit third parties.”Those fears are likely to fall on deaf ears, however. The league’s chief executive, Javier Tebas, has long been a proponent of attempting to increase the marketability of his product and is understood to have pressed ahead with the deal despite widespread opposition among clubs.Official approval has also yet to be granted by Fifa but provisional plans are already in place to host the inaugural match before the end of this season, with Miami the most likely destination given its large Hiic community and the success of the friendly between Real Madrid and Barcelona that was held in the city last year. A repeat of the clásico has already been ruled out, although Ross, who also owns the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami as well as the NFL franchise team, hinted on Thursday: “I think you might have heard very much of one of the teams. One of the bigger teams.”Stillitano adds: “They’re rumours. But it’s fair to say one of them has to be a recognisable team. If this builds and we do it right the first time, obviously by year three or four we could have two mid-level teams but we think the first couple have to be a team people in the States will recognise. There are four or five candidates in Spain – this wouldn’t work if you had two teams who are fighting against relegation, for example. But it will be this season, for sure. We have to look at schedules and work with the clubs but Mr Tebas is certainly committed to it, as is Mr Ross. We’re going to shoot for this year without question.”Relevent will also have access to the rights to La Liga when the league’s $120m-a-season deal with beIN Sports ends in 2020, as well as controlling merchandise and academy initiatives at grassroots level. However, with NBC having paid the equivalent of nearly $170m a season in 2015 to broadcast the Premier League, there is no doubt who is the market leader.Widespread opposition to the 39th game, which proposed an extra fixture for all 20 clubs being played at neutral venues around the world and all the implications that would have for a fair competition, made it a non-starter a decade ago. With Scudamore due to stand down by the end of 2018 after nearly 20 years at the helm, the Premier League currently has no plans to follow Spain’s example and is understood to have poured cold water over the prospect at a broadcasters’ briefing last week. But Stillitano insists that market forces could mean the prospect of English league matches taking place overseas is just around the corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

They chatted as they ate and later went to a local pool to combat the sweltering heat. “It was a normal day,” says Bahar. The group parted company at about 7pm. Less than five hours later, Avcı was shot in the stomach and died. Sezer, her boyfriend of six months, has been arrested, but not charged. Sezer has reportedly claimed that Avcı “insulted his manhood”.Bahar and Avcı are both trans women. At 24, Avcı had just started her transition. She was excited about getting surgery, and being able to live fully and honestly with her family. Once the home of one of the largest LGBT pride marches in the wider region, in recent years there has been a growing backlash against the community in Turkey. Pride marches were banned four years ago. People who have taken to the streets have been met with teargas and violent dispersals.In 2017 all public LGBT events in Ankara, the capital, were banned. Earlier this month, the head of Turkey’s public broadcaster TRT said that Turkey would not rejoin Eurovision if it continued to have contestants like “the bearded Austrian in the skirt” – in reference to 2014’s winner, Conchita.“There’s this constant emphasis on one nation, one religion, one ethnicity. Everything is consolidated around this uniformity of what it means to be a Turkish citizen who deserves to live,” says Asli Zengin, an LGBT activist and visiting professor at Brown University’s anthropology department.Transgender women are especially vulnerable to violence. Discrimination means it can be difficult to find jobs many are forced into sex work to survive, putting them at even greater risk. Institutionally, the court system is stacked against them. Under Turkish law an “unjust provocation” can lower sentences. In cases of violence against transgender women, men will often say they did not know the woman was trans and, like Sezer, that she “insulted their manhood” as evidence for an “unjust provocation”.“Often, judges use their discretion to interpret the whole interaction between a transgender woman and a cisgender man – and their sexual intercourse – as a trigger of unjust provocation,” explains Zengin.Yasemin Öz, a Turkish LGBT rights activist and lawyer, says the number of judges willing to accept an “insult to manhood” as a reason for an unjust provocation defence has decreased over the years, as LGBT lawyers and activists have worked on more of these cases. Nevertheless, it remains potent: in a recent case, the killers of a gay Syrian refugee murdered in 2016 were given a reduced sentence on grounds of “unjust provocation”. In places like Samsun, where there are no LGBT organisations advocating for the rights of the local community, the situation is even more insecure. “It all depends on the attitude of the judge, unfortunately,” says Öz. “But where there are no LGBT organisations, the attitude change can be slower.”Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir all have multiple LGBT organisations that provide legal and social support to the community. Samsun is a quiet, traditional city in a part of the country that has consistently voted for the conservative ruling party AKP.Deniz, 25, a trans woman who did not want to reveal her last name, says some trans women in Samsun do not like to leave the house. “If someone has long hair and breasts as a trans woman, they’re excluded from society,” she says. Deniz recently stopped taking hormones and cut her hair so she could pass more easily on the street. Her family does not accept her as a trans woman, and she says she doesn’t feel safe going outside while presenting as female.In contrast, Avcı’s family accepted her, and were able to help her financially. Her friends are full of anecdotes about her generosity. “If she saw someone on the street, she would give them 100 Turkish lira,” recalls Can, a 22-year-old trans woman and friend of Avcı’s.“There is this sense of masculinity, which feels entitled to anything,” says Zengin. “Impunity is becoming the norm … it’s not only transgender murders, but also cis women whose murders have reached a statistically high number in Turkey.” In Samsun, this feeling is visceral. After Avcı’s death the community was in shock. “We wondered if this is how we’re going to die in the end,” says Can. For many in the LGBT community, the atmosphere in Samsun is now tinged with fear. Avcı’s death has made the dangers starker.“I feel alone now,” says Bahar. “We’d understand each other just by looks, not even through talking. We were together every day … I can’t express it. I still don’t believe that it’s real, I still don’t believe she’s gone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c978bc3e28e15b1a74cbf36624d0f3f316b087/129_77_1516_910/master/1516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eedc90a89b1f10b87827e63b9d2bf2b9","title":"trinidad judge loses bid to halt legal inquiry into his private life","story":"Chief justice Ivor Archie had tried to stop law association’s investigation which could lead to his removal from officeJudges in London have dismissed an attempt by the chief justice of Trinidad and Tobago to halt a legal investigation into his private life and alleged business dealings.Ivor Archie had been facing mounting public criticism over his “close friendship” with Dillian Johnson, who was described as a “convicted felon” in a judgment issued by the judicial committee of the privy council (JCPC) on Thursday. The ruling will add to the pressure on the country’s most senior lawyer, who has held the post since January 2008. The Caribbean state is one of the few countries that still uses the JCPC as an ultimate court of appeal. Five senior members of the UK’s supreme court, including its president, Lady Hale, heard the case.Johnson fled to the UK after surviving a shooting last December. He is being assisted by the human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who said there was “public hostility and great stigma attached to homosexuality” in Trinidad and Tobago. “Buggery” remains punishable by up to 25 years in prison.Archie, 57, who is married, is an honorary member of the Middle Temple in London, one of London’s four inns of court, and is considered a liberal thinker on gay rights. He has denied having an “intimate” relationship with Johnson. The Law Association of Trinidad and Tobago has begun the process of establishing a committee of inquiry into Archie’s behaviour which could ultimately lead to his removal from office.Another report, the JCPC judgment said, alleged that “Johnson was among 12 people recommended for Housing Development Corporation (HDC) units” by the chief justice, who had “personally called and communicated via social media with a senior HDC official to fast-track the applications”.The country’s Sunday Express newspaper complained that Archie had not responded to the allegations but “instead he has shown a brazen imperviousness to public questioning and criticism which has laid bare the effective autocracy of the chief justice”. It was also reported that Archie “has been joined by Johnson, 36, while on official business abroad”. The law association decided that the allegations were “sufficiently grave” and that a committee should be established to ascertain the facts and report back.But Archie issued a judicial review challenge questioning whether the law association had the power to conduct such an investigation, suggesting it was biased against him, had demonstrated bad faith and that its procedures were unfair.The chief justice has denied the allegations against him relating to Johnson, though he has admitted that he forwarded the names of some “needy and deserving persons” to the housing authority for consideration.Delivering judgment, Hale rejected all of the grounds of appeal advanced by lawyers for Archie. She also cancelled an injunction imposed by Trinidad’s court of appeal which prevented the law association from continuing with its investigation into the chief justice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac7c0ab042230838c3bf83754ed7765793fbfb6d/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0e449f1469bb25f36ead5777af238c","title":"good nights sleep cure loneliness","story":"New studies have shown that sleep deprivation can make people feel lonely – and social isolation can disrupt sleep. It is vital to break the vicious cycleHere is a new problem to keep you awake at night: could sleep deprivation be affecting your social life? Not in the sense that you’re too tired to go out – although it could mean that, too – but could your very sleeplessness be off-putting to other people?In another experiment, 1,000 people were asked to rate photographs of people – some in a sleep-deprived state – according to how socially attractive they seemed. The sleep-deprived people came off worse. And the researchers concluded that sleep-related alienation could “trigger the transmission of loneliness” – after viewing clips of sleep-deprived people, otherwise healthy and happy participants then felt lonelier.“We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers,” said Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the senior author of the study, who wrote the bestselling book Why We Sleep. “The less sleep you get, the less you want to socially interact. In turn, other people perceive you as more socially repulsive, further increasing the grave social-isolation impact of sleep loss. That vicious cycle may be a significant contributing factor to the public health crisis that is loneliness.”Last year, a study of 2,000 young adults by researchers at King’s College London found lonelier people had poorer-quality sleep, were more likely to feel tired and had more difficulty focusing on tasks during the day than those who didn’t report feeling lonely. “It could be that feeling you’re all on your own in the world, a fundamentally unsafe feeling, could make it difficult to have a restful night’s sleep,” says Timothy Matthews, a research associate at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. “And that, in turn, could mean you’re not at your best and you don’t get the best out of your social interactions, which could increase feelings of loneliness.”There could be an evolutionary element, he says. “Some scientists believe that loneliness is part of our evolutionary heritage, because our ancestors would stick together in groups in order to succeed. If you have an aversion to being cut off from the group, that would have served an adaptive purpose. If you feel you’re alone, that’s comparable to feeling unsafe. The world seems a more threatening place and that perception could make it difficult to have a more restful sleep because you’re more on guard for your safety.”Could it be useful for people to keep in mind that poor sleep could be a reason for their feelings of loneliness? “Loneliness is really complex and you can’t put it down to one thing,” she says. “I think we would say it would be a factor, but we’d need to look at other factors, too.” Things such as health problems and economic status “are big factors in loneliness. If you have ill-health or you are worried about money, that is probably going to keep you up, so it can all become part of this vicious cycle.”But for some people experiencing loneliness, the idea that poor-quality sleep can be improved, and can reduce their social isolation, may be a wake-up call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eabdbdc744f82428945038605759e604c18a4e0/1_0_2282_1370/master/2282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47b5d4b8848208b57198840f7cf7c0","title":"far righters james bond not on your team idris elba","story":"Katie Hopkins and Richard Spencer are upset at the idea of Idris Elba as 007. What makes them think the sexy, elitist spy is theirs to claim?Greetings, pop pickers – and you are cordially welcomed to an exciting new Lost in showbiz series. It is entitled You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now?, and aims to showcase the pettier preoccupations of the far rightradical rightwhatever the free-speech snowflakes are demanding to\u0026nbspbe called this week. Now, you’d think these guys have a lot of big things to talk about. The clash of civilisations. The White House putsch. The fact you can’t say anything any more, even though they literally just said whatever it was. But it’s amazing how often the leading lights of wingnuttery become obsessed with sensationally trivial things.Only the other week, I saw Infowars starlet Paul Joseph Watson getting really upset about a temporary floating sculpture on the Serpentine in London’s Hyde Park. Poor Prison Plonker! On the one hand, you want to say: dude, it’s great that you left your flat. It always feels to me like you’re 10 minutes off hiring a chief of staff, and I think that fresh air is a big part of staving off that inevitable moment.On the other hand: I’m sorry the sculpture hurt your feelings. But it’s just art. It can’t harm you. You don’t have to like it – not at all – but it’s going to be gone in a month or so, and you can still use the pedalos while it’s there. (Although, can you not go on them this weekend, because I’m going with my children. And whilst I’m mostly amused at the thought of them shouting: “THAT ISLAND’S LIKE ABNEY AND TEAL’S ISLAND!” while we drift past you shouting into your GoPro camera about men’s rights, it might be a bit worlds-colliding for me to handle while I’m pedalling.)But back to You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now? Guess what this week’s big-wedge issue on the far right is. Is it some notional attack by “antifa” (ie anyone who disagrees with them)? Is it the hundreds of US news organisations opposing Donald Trump’s attacks on the press? No! It’s who might or might not play a pretend person in a movie. James Bond, to be precise, which in its current iteration is essentially a franchise about a man who has to have sex with as many beautiful women as he can in the world’s leading spa hotels. It’s like the Condé Nast Traveller version of Pokémon Go. But sexy, and with GCHQ top notes. And when the actor gets interviewed about it afterwards, they have to come off like the job’s slightly more gruelling than the Shackleton expedition.Anyway, news that Idris Elba is back in favour for the role is turning out to be one of the major plotlines in the twatosphere this week. Not only has Katie Hopkins made a video about it – more on that later – but American white supremacist Richard Spencer has devoted a lengthy and thundering tweetstorm (tweetsturm?) to it.I know what you’re thinking. Is the Fourth Reich actually here? Are all the institutions of a fully realised neo-Nazi utopia in place? Because if I were a white supremacist, I’d want to know every last person who didn’t\u0026nbspseem like me had been rounded up before I saw my thought\u0026nbspleader spending ONE SECOND of time having a view on who might play the lead role in a sexy spy movie. If I’ve told them once, I’ve told them a thousand times: it’s Lebensraum first, THEN you get around to having a view on who plays laser iPhones with Q.But we are where we are. For reasons which are really a matter for a trainee psychoanalyst, who plays James Bond is a big thing for Spencer. To this end, he has unleashed a series of thoughts so bovine that I’ll just give you one for a little flavour. “Make no mistake,” begins one of Richard’s mistakes, “a black James Bond would be an act of dispossession far greater than a flotilla of a million refugees.”OK … Aside from everything else – and there is a lot there – I can’t believe I’ve got to explain the absolute basics of the James Bond franchise to Richard Spencer. This thing really couldn’t be simpler or less opaque. It makes Jason Statham\u0026nbspmovies look like Mulholland Drive.Still, here goes: Richard? Richard??? What do you care what colour James Bond is? James Bond isn’t even on your team! YOU PLAY FOR SPECTRE, YES? If you’re not sure how your values align with those of that organisation, and not with those of say, Judi ruddy Dench, then let me help you. You believe democracy is a “passing fad”. You believe in highly non-mainstream world domination. And here’s the dead giveaway – Spectre is packed with actual Nazis! Blofeld literally sold secrets to the Third Reich. These. Are. Your. People.You know who isn’t your guy? Some elitist one-percenter in an Yves Saint Laurent dinner jacket who can’t go 50 miles in a high-performance sports car without shagging the help. How are you going to sell that to your incels? We all saw the footage from the Charlottesville rally – no sex is absolutely\u0026nbsppart of your side of the\u0026nbspbrand.Be honest, Richard. How do you see Bond working as a tiki-torchbearer for you lot? Let’s just stick a pin in the first reel of Skyfall, and try to picture one of your guys in the role. “Oh I’m sorry, I’m going to be unable to have sex with you in the shower of this seven-star Macau\u0026nbsp casino because a) I don’t like the look of Macau and b) Owing to what I believe to be a gland issue I feel self-conscious when I remove my buttoned-up white polo shirt and outsize pleat-front chinos.”Sorry, Richard, but at that point you’ve just lost the hard drive with the details of MI6’s entire undercover agent programme. Idris would have got the hard drive. He’d have had done what was expected of him in the shower (and done it well), then decoded some complicated cyberterrorism whatnot and relayed the breakdown of it back to London. Then sauntered off to have it out with Javier Bardem on that island that looks a bit like my flat after a Christmas party. I don’t see one of your lot getting it done, Richard. Waa waa waa, people are trying to replace us. Waa waa waa, can we stop for Cheetos.As for Katie Hopkins’s\u0026nbsp contribution to this absolute keystone of a debate, her video. What to say about this effort? As a filmmaker, she’s very like Leni Riefenstahl, except talentless and presumably filming in her garage. The production values are slightly lower than you might expect if you pressed record while your phone was in your pocket. It opens with Katie declaring: “No, Idris Elba, you cannot be James Bond,” – an assertion to which the only response\u0026nbspis: pretty sure that’s going to be up to Barbara Broccoli, not someone honking into the void somewhere in Devon.But clearly, there is a much bigger\u0026nbspissue here. Namely, what is the point – WHAT IS THE POINT – of making a Bond-related alt-right video if you don’t use this golden opportunity to do a pastiche of Nancy Sinatra’s You Only Live Twice\u0026nbsptheme? It is the most open of all open goals. Think about it. Soaring strings. Cue titles. And then Katie’s voice warbling: “You own the\u0026nbsplibs twice …” Fine, I apologise for the fact\u0026nbspthat you’re going to have that as an earworm for the rest of the day. But honestly.

Instead, its cut-up electronics sounded half-dead.Madonna loves metaphors. Over an oddly laboured beat, we’re told her body’s “fully loaded”. “Bring ya knife into a gunfight,” she adds. There have been better ideas.A Benny Benassi-assisted club banger, with a terrible title. The filter sweeps used brilliantly throughout Confessions on a Dancefloor don’t sparkle here.Unnecessary trance-era update of pop’s most achingly simple song about sex, with electronics that diffuse any thrill. Bring back Peggy Lee’s double bass.Madonna is usually better when she’s striding alone. This duet with Britney Spears is all obvious raunch, without solid roots.A Paul Oakenfold EDM co-write for her second Best Of with shadows of her old selves, but more light is required.Eva Perón throws her husband’s mistress out on the streets, and Madonna’s wavering vocal goes full collywobbles.Oddly sexless Sex-era single, not helped by awkward synthesised sighs, and a slapdash direction to “put your hands all over my body”.An understandable if curt greeting. Still going “hard or we go home” after 33 years, Madonna employs perky youthful melodies here. Energetic, but exhausting.This 2012 candy-pop chorus really fizzes, but Nicki Minaj and M.I.A.’s cheerleading whoops, and their raps, quickly dissolve. Unforgivable spelling too.A slighter facsimile of the imperial Into the Groove, protesting too much about its abilities to coax out the noise police.Originally the first single for Madonna’s second album, before Like a Virgin slinked along. An early pass at religious-ecstasy pop, but needing bigger wings.63. The Look of Love (1987)Inspired by James Stewart’s glances at Grace Kelly in Rear Window, this Who’s That Girl? track sits on an occasionally interesting tide of tropical sounds.Madonna aiming to reclaim the MOR market after years squirming around in sex. There’s better ballads on her Something to Remember anthology.Madonna’s intermittently affecting song for Guy Ritchie, about the hardships of love. Released the same month she filed for orce.A genuinely interesting concept-pop comeback, undermined by rhyming “Mini Cooper” with “super-duper”. And “Pilates” with “hotties”. While rapping.A half-annoying, half-brilliant EDM career manifesto, positing Madonna as Duracell bunny: “When the lights go down and there’s no one leftI can go on and on and on”.In a world of “too many questions”, “distractions” and “options”, love was Madonna’s saving grace in 2003. The tune begins labouredly, but digs in.Madonna’s six months of vocal training before Evita reveal new capacities for feeling here. But sorry, Lloyd Webber – it’s no Live To Tell.1987 soundtrack signature song, lifted by a curious, featherlight chorus line. As Balearic moments go, La Isla Bonita was better.Madonna’s babyish 1940s-style vocals, filtered to sound like they’re wavering through a wireless, still crackle with charm.Written by Madonna for her co-writer Patrick Leonard’s nine-year-old daughter, this song’s moments of twisted childhood psychedelia lessen the schmaltz.Madonna usually makes others’ styles sound like her own. This Björk co-write, gorgeously hypnotic as it is, sounds too much like Björk.Co-written with 80s fist-pumping emotional supremo David Foster (Peter Cetera’s Glory of Love, the St Elmo’s Fire soundtrack). It tries hard, and snags.One of the US Parental Advisory Committee’s original “Filthy 15” banned songs. Today, its mentions of velvet kisses over a body are gently erting.Madonna’s best performance in Evita, in the 1996 film’s brand new Webber-and-Rice composition. The quaking desperation in her vocal stays the right side of emotional.An awkward, pleasingly punky track for the Matthew Modine wrestling film Vision Quest.

Madonna played the wise-cracking Mae.“Drunk by six” and smoked too many cigarettes? Madonna’s singing your song, a well-honed, slow piece of pop theatre.Over propulsive early-90s electronica, Madonna tells us she’s “drowningBaby, throw out your rope”. Her delivery suggests she’ll save herself.Before being signed, Madonna was a New York no-waver (and Thurston Moore’s neighbour). You hear delicious hints of that here.The atmospheric verses to this mid-90s ballad look towards Madonna’s Ray of Light masterpieces. Cigarette lighters in the air are optional.Proof that Madonna can still do classically simple pop singles nearly four decades into her career. This is bright, glossy and fun.Well-tailored, retro-positioned pop that’s aged remarkably well. Written as a wide-eyed Valentine for Madonna’s then-husband, Sean Penn.Heavenly ode to early motherhood, released when Madonna’s daughter Lourdes was two. Occasionally, honesty cuts through: “When she’s awakeI’m up all night”.A failed relationship turned into compellingly cinematic orchestral drama, co-written with R\u0026ampB producer Babyface.From its effortlessly English sample of Charlotte Gainsbourg’s voice in the 1993 film The Cement Garden, this sounds like a Saint Etienne song accidentally covered by a superstar.Madonna’s first big pop ballad, showing the world she could do more than provocative pop. Slightly soupy, but still sweet.Timbaland’s synth-brass intro here is fantastic, and the song’s end-of-the-world grandeur still sounds razor-sharp. Would be better without Justin Timberlake, though.A gorgeously slinky, impish love song to Madonna’s then-boyfriend, film runner Andy Bird. The affair ended quickly, but the song endures.Sultry, persuasive R\u0026ampB with a Spanish guitar undertow. Madonna’s deep vocals cleverly never disclose what her baby’s secret actually is.Adapted by Madonna from a country song written by her brother-in-law, Joe Henry, its catchiness pivoting off that brilliantly strange, fractured guitar figure.Stuttering into life like a long-lost Tom Tom Club single, before introducing us to a new brand of pop attitude. Everybody demanded we dance.A hit glowing with summer, throwing in early Balearic-era guitars, and some delicious winks and nods to the Latin pop market.One of Ray of Light’s many powerful sub-aquatic electronic ballads. Co-written with Rick Nowels, later a Lana Del Rey and Lykke Li collaborator.Lush strings and bassy pianos on this classy 1989 primal scream. Hugely emo, parent-baiting lyrics, but gorgeous in its execution.A classy post-Vogue excursion into 90s R\u0026ampB. Stabs of house piano and synthesised strings propel us brilliantly into Madonna’s cavern of love.A starlit, star-brightened nursery rhyme that flutters gently into life, before becoming the first properly polished, distinctively Madonna-sounding pop song.Credit and interest are reappropriated playfully as metaphors in Madonna’s career-changing hit. Till-ringing pop hooks were never so much fun to play with again.Launching off from a West End Girls synthesiser sound (Madonna told Stuart Price “I fucking love the Pet Shop Boys” when she recognised the nod), this is a slice of Confessions pop perfection.Twisting the agonies of heartbreak into a song about hope for the future, this track’s pulsing house piano, gospel vocals and boxfresh Diplo production sound fantastic.More filter-sweeping gorgeousness from the mid-2000s. “Do you believe in love at first sight?  It’s an illusion, I don’t care,” she sings, thrillingly.Male-run record labels appropriated the V-word, but female pop stars didn’t, before Madonna, unless they were singing Christmas carols. Madonna reclaimed it, and then some.Childlike innocence rushes through the Like a Prayer album, but while Dear Jessie smothered itself in schmaltz, Cherish was all impish, forthright joy.Best-of extra tracks are rarely as dreamily sexy as this, adapted from a love letter sung to Lenny Kravitz by Prince collaborator Ingrid Chavez.In the midst of its parent album’s panting obviousness, Rain was Erotica’s most properly erogenous moment. The rain builds slowly, then pours, its “dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky”. Madonna’s vocals teem with longing too, first sounding full of hope, then full of welcome, moving to release.A song either about the power of dancing, or about a girl begging her boy to get into her groove sexually, as it were, to cement their relationship (“touch my body  move in time  now I know you’re mine”). Or both. It doesn’t matter. The whole confection’s irresistible.A rousing Rebel Heart single set after the apocalypse about the power of love. In it, a woman gives a man the fire, cover and light that he needs – a nice twist in a world turned to dust. Inspired by growing religious and political intolerance, Madonna’s lyrics and a skyscraping melody pack punches.Madonna’s best excursion into the sounds of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, sampling the bassline from What You Need by USCanadian trio Main Source, with Dave Hall (Mary J Blige, Mariah Carey) as her co-writer. Contains some killer lines, both sneered or whispered: “I’m not your bitch  Don’t hang your shit on me”.Madonna’s a good agony aunt when it comes to men. “Put your love to the test”, she advises, not that she means trying out his satin sheets (“what happens when you’re not in bed?”, she adds sensibly). Get someone emotionally available, who can “lift you to your higher ground”. Horns and synths joyously fanfare this advice.A fabulous ascending-then-descending bassline bolsters one of Madonna’s most club-ready songs. Its lyric is also one of her most unforgiving, reprimanding a serial apologist. “You’re not half the man you think you are,” she sings, before her knockout blow arrives a verse later. “There’s more important things than hearing you speak.”Majestic, reflective and sung in a subdued style for Madonna, this meditation on fame with a Ballardian reference in its title soars quietly and gorgeously.“I had so many loversWho settled for the thrillOf basking in my spotlight,” float her words, without emotion. Then the most desperate lie arrives, sadder than anything: “I never felt so happy.”One of Madonna’s sparkliest imperial-period pop singles. It plays today like a pitch to those still not then believing in her: “I’ve had to work much harder than thisFor something I want, don’t try to resist me.” Escape was impossible anyway, we discover. “Don’t try to runI can keep up with you.”A glorious update of the blissfully simple sentiments of Holiday and Everybody, infused with a Daft Punk-like robotic swagger, courtesy of Mirwais’ production. Its unlikely inspiration was Madonna’s attendance at a Sting gig: she was moved at how physically his songs connected his fans. Bonus points for the way she sings “bourgeoisie”.Probably the best thing Madonna’s done in cinema, despite the mediocrity of the film that it’s from (At Close Range, directed by James Foley, who would later shoot Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed). Madonna’s lyrics for the bridge were written on the spot, giving the song’s incredible, stark atmosphere even more stunning, bruised drama.Written by the disco group Pure Energy and turned down by Phyllis Hyman and the Supremes’ Mary Wilson, Madonna and Jellybean Benitez’s take on this blissfully simple four minutes of summer has never lost its freshness or warmth. That stuttering bassline and those Latin drums help. Madonna played cowbell.Dark, orchestral ambient is a mood at which Madonna excels. Frozen marries the different temperatures of 90s pop stunningly: the faltering chill of William Orbit’s electronica with the dusty, cinematic heat of North African melodies and strings. The extremes are fair enough. Madonna’s character’s attempting the melting of a heart, after all.Made quickly as a B-side for Dick Tracy single Keep It Together, Vogue updated Salsoul disco brilliantly for the end of the century. It also made gay culture celebratory again after the crushing Aids decade (“everywhere you turn is heartacheit’s everywhere that you go”). It became the A-side soon enough.That title, and this whole glorious song, teem with imperative instructions to the older generation by the mid-80s Madonna’s time had truly come. Determination pulses in her no-nonsense vocals – her character’s going to keep her baby, she’s made up her mind – while that glorious string arrangement adds cinematic authority to an all-too-relatable, everyday drama.Curtis Muldoon’s 1972 album track Sepheryn sounds like a track destined for a Nuggets-style noughties’ psych-folk anthology. But after Madonna heard William Orbit’s demo of the track with singer Christine Leach, she adapted the melody, added a verse, and invoked absolute magic. One of her most joyous electronic pop singles.Madonna’s entire career in glitterball-brightened time travel. We filter-sweep from the disco sounds of late 70s clubs to the mashup phenomenon of the early 2000s, before ascending to another level entirely. An Abba sample could have been a death-knell. It was a career rejuvenator.Touchingly, this was Madonna’s first US top 10 hit. The young, untutored star is at her most gentle and beseeching here: “Just try to understandI’ve given all I can.” The song’s pure melody underlines how much she had already, and how much she would thereafter. Madonna still performs it regularly, and with reason.Madonna’s greatest single was written with Patrick Leonard in a day, just like a dream. Its lyrics play famously, with the euphoric possibilities within religion and sex, but they also explore ideas of vulnerability and power within its layers of sumptuous, immediate sound. Madonna’s character has “no choice” when she hears “your voice”, her vocals conveying wilful submissiveness with absolute tenderness. But she also has faith in herself: “you know I’ll take you there” is repeated like the Staple Singers’ early 70s mantra. Here, however, it transforms into a celebration of emotional, personal conviction. She is Madonna, after all.

Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f63634edd3322766f5b575eaee52659d8b49dfad/0_107_4954_2973/master/4954.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2313012f2eb81aaf589e852d102ea967","title":"a level results doctor medical school sheffield university","story":"After missing the grades I needed for medical school, I found another way to realise my dream It was August 2007 I stood in the classroom, surrounded by my school friends, clutching the large brown envelope that contained my A-level results. I wanted to become a doctor and had the next five years of my life all planned out. I opened the envelope to find three As and two Bs staring back at me. My heart sank.Although by most standards I had done very well, a B in chemistry prevented me from studying medicine at Bristol and the second B, in biology, meant I wouldn’t be going to medical school at all. Suddenly the years I had set out ahead of me were empty and I had no idea what was going to happen. Although they tried, my friends and family couldn’t say anything to make the situation better. What was there to say? I’d got a very good set of A-level results. I received texts from my classmates, who were out in Liverpool celebrating, telling me to join them. “Everything happens for a reason,” they said. “It will all work out.” But I felt numb and couldn’t face anybody. This was a real failure and unfortunately no amount of quadruple vodkas surrounded by fun-loving Scousers was going to fix it. Staying at home while all my friends moved on was something I couldn’t face, so I chose a course through clearing at Sheffield University with the most relevance to medicine. Having a major knock to your confidence just before a new phase of your life isn’t ideal. It’s especially not ideal to study biomedical science and then be regularly asked if you’re a “failed medic”. But almost from the moment I walked through the lecture theatre doors, I knew Sheffield would be forever special to me. Pints that cost £1, Arctic Monkeys on repeat and as much gravy as you could handle - Yorkshire welcomed me with open arms. I threw myself into university life. I learned, in equal measure, about the molecular biology of cells and the best way to body paint for a fancy dress night out.In my final year, it was time to think about life after university. Naturally, I began to consider medicine again. I was worried that maybe I wasn’t meant to be a doctor. I knew I wanted to spend my life caring for people, and that a privilege like that wouldn’t come easily. Yet I knew I couldn’t make fear an excuse. My Sheffield friends convinced me to apply again. Degree results day came round and it was different this time. I found my candidate number and rolled my finger across the paper to find that all the hard work had paid off. I couldn’t believe it – I had managed to get the first-class degree that would get me into Bristol medical school. I am now a qualified doctor. I’ve survived my first two foundation years in hospital and have just started GP training. I can see that the failure I experienced all those years ago, and the unknown situation it forced me in to, enabled me to build resilience – the kind that is vital to work as a doctor under pressure in our NHS. I also hope that my journey has made me a more compassionate and understanding doctor as I move forward in my career. Although I wouldn’t usually recommend a prescription of copious amounts of Henderson’s relish, pies and Yorkshire ale to drown your sorrows, my life ersion gave me so many experiences I wouldn’t have had if things had gone differently that day in August.Things won’t go as expected for many receiving their exam results today. My advice would be that although it will be difficult to see at first, there are many paths that can take you to where you want to be. Things don’t always happen for a reason. Sometimes things just happen. I now know that it’s how you learn to deal with it and bounce back that is the most important thing. Yorkshire taught me that. So take it from me, if at first you don’t succeed, definitely try again.If you would like to contribute to our Blood, sweat and tears series about memorable experiences in healthcare, read our guidelines and get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fdff98f37cc9745e76c0557290b8589dd5a1475/0_1_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20e2d8aba43801b331f0b3a44fcf51ee","title":"allotments share your pictures","story":"Far more than just a plot of land, the UK’s allotments are some of our most treasured green spaces.

On Thursday plans were unveiled to extend that right to those who let from a housing association across 70 local authorities in the Midlands.The announcement came days after the government scrapped a plan from 2015 to force the sale of council homes in areas with high-value properties, following fierce opposition from councils.That proposal had been intended to fund the national rollout of the right-to-buy policy for housing associations tenants. It is now unclear how the nationwide scheme will be paid for.John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, called it a “wasteful policy” that would now mean public money being spent selling off affordable homes at a discount when it should be used to build them instead.“Right to buy has decimated our council housing stock in this country,” he said. “By expanding this policy, the Tories are only going to make the housing crisis worse.”The Midlands pilot announced on Thursday will be funded by £200m from the Treasury, funding already earmarked in the 2017 budget, with places on the scheme allocated via a ballot. Tenants have one month from the scheme’s launch to make their application.The housing secretary, James Brokenshire, said money from the discounted sales of housing association homes would be used to fund their replacements.“This government is committed to providing opportunities for people to get a foot on the property ladder and to have a place they can call their own,” he said. “Our £200m investment into the Midlands voluntary right-to-buy pilot is the first step in helping housing association tenants realise their dream of homeownership.”The National Housing Federation, which has worked with the government on the design of the scheme, said it was vital homes were replaced. Chief executive David Orr said: “It will be a success for everyone involved only if every home that is sold is replaced with a new affordable home, and if the application process is as smooth as possible for tenants.“This scheme must empower social housing tenants and meet our own ambitions to deliver the homes the country needs.”Experts sounded a note of caution. David Pipe, policy and practice officer at the Chartered Institute of Housing, said: “Our concern is that even if this is achieved, the replacements won’t necessarily be like for like.“We may see social rented homes being sold and replaced with homes that are let at higher rents, or we could see homes being sold in one area and replacements built somewhere else. So there remains a real danger that some areas will still lose much-needed social housing as a result of the pilot.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the ballot would be the fairest way of coping with the anticipated high demand, as opposed to a first come, first served basis that could disadvantage residents with accessibility issues, or those who could not get on to the internet in the first few days of opening.A key test for the pilot will be the feasibility of so-called “portability”, by which housing associations will be given discretion over which properties they sell and where tenants who want to buy a property that is exempt can be offered an alternative home to purchase.Pipe argued that a full rollout of the scheme would not be the best use of public money. “At a time when we desperately need more affordable housing, this money would be better spent on building new homes for rent and for shared ownership,” he said.About 94,000 council housing tenants have exercised their right to buy since 2010."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e5949c8c2eed1cf93bad32ad1f1b9591701f3c7/274_178_3764_2258/master/3764.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caef51b1a6579d25a278939fdf01e517","title":"ben stokes australia big bash closed sydney sixers","story":"Ben Stokes could see his return to the Big Bash League blocked, with the Australian team who were leading the chase to sign him ruling out any formal approach until after a cricket disciplinary commission has reached a decision on any punishment.Although Stokes was acquitted of affray after a week-long trial at Bristol crown court, the Sydney Sixers, who have openly expressed interest in the England all-rounder, take a dim view of his role in a Bristol street brawl.Jodie Hawkins, general manager of the Sydney Sixers, one of Australia’s leading T20 sides, said the team had akeen interest in the 27-year-old but evidence from the Bristol trial of Stokes and two other men had caused concern.“I’ve been following it all very closely and I definitely think what’s gone on with Ben would be a consideration in signing him,” Hawkins said. “He’s been acquitted but it’s definitely not a good look. We had been interested in him because a player of Ben’s calibre is always on your radar but until this is all cleared up, and that includes the ECB disciplinary process, we wouldn’t even consider it.”It is thought the Cricket Disciplinary Commission, which acts independently under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board, will convene in the coming days to discuss whether Stokes is guilty of bringing the game into disrepute but it could take months for it to reach a conclusion and decide on any action.The ECB will address winter plans if an official approach is made to Stokes. But the  understands a no objection certificate (NOC) would be issued by his employer to play a short stint in Australian domestic cricket. Stokes, who was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, played for Melbourne Renegades in early 2015. But Cricket Australia may block his return, not least because the success of the Big Bash has been attributed to its appeal to families including young children. In 2016 more than half of the spectators across the tournament were families.The Big Bash is so protective of its “family-friendly” brand that no return has been granted to the West Indies batsman Chris Gayle who caused outrage in 2016 when he made inappropriate comments in a pitchside television interview with Mel McLaughlin, a female broadcaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24e83cf9b8782a16979bd7c53965d1a588d0cc51/116_136_3138_1883/master/3138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37179b1debde1157b8615e202b3a68ff","title":"noah lyles us sprinter birmingham 100m","story":"The king is dead. Long live the king? With Usain Bolt retired, athletics needs a new sprint hero. The brilliant\u0026nbspyoung American Noah Lyles reckons he has the talent and charisma to fill some of the 6ft\u0026nbsp5in hole left by the Jamaican.“I want to transcend the sport,” says Lyles, who runs in Britain for the first time at the Birmingham grand prix on Saturday. “Track and field in America isn’t that big until the Olympics comes around and I want to change that.”Lyles is certainly fast. Not only is he the quickest man over 100m and 200m this year but his personal bests – 9.88sec for 100m and 19.65 for 200m – are better than Bolt’s at the same stage (21 years and one month). However, he literally dreams of getting a lot quicker.“In 2016 I had a dream where I raced and the clock flashed 9.41 and I ran up to my mom and said: ‘Mom, I just ran 9.41,’” he says, laughing. “And she was like: ‘That’s nice, Noah.’ And then she turned around and said: “What did you just say? That’s a world record.’ But I do really think I can run 9.41. I don’t know when it’s going to happen but I’m going to try my best to do it.”Like Bolt, Lyles is a natural showman. When he raced in Doha in\u0026nbspMay he wore R2D2 socks and swung a pretend lightsaber to celebrate Star Wars day. A few weeks later in Eugene he put his hands in the air before the start and called for a “spirit bomb”, a move from the TV show Dragon Ball Z. And when he became the youngest man since 1984 to win the 100m at the US trials he wore Incredibles socks and celebrated with the Shoot dance, popularised by the video game Fortnite. For good measure Lyles is also a budding rapper and has a YouTube channel.His priority for now, though, is to prove himself as the top sprinter in the world – and make up for lost time having missed last year’s world championships in London due to a torn hamstring, which meant he never got to face Bolt.“Am I sad I didn’t get to race against him at least once? Yes. Maybe now I would have been able to challenge him at the end of his career but, if we’re talking about him in his heyday, I don’t think anyone could really challenge him besides Yohan Blake.”In Birmingham Lyles will race the 100m and believes he could run a personal best of around 9.85sec. However he accepts it will be tough against a stacked field that includes 14 men who have gone under 10 seconds, including the world 60m record holder, Christian Coleman, as well as\u0026nbspZharnel Hughes and Reece Prescod, the European 100m gold and silver medallists.“I’m really happy for Zharnel because I’ve been watching him for a few years,” Lyles says. “He’s been on that cusp of breaking 10 seconds for the 100m. This year he finally did it and he actually did it on me in Jamaica. I felt really happy for him. I hadn’t heard of Prescod before this year. He has shocked me a little. But it’s great that we have all these athletes facing-off in big races. The\u0026nbspsport has a past history of not having the top-tier guys go off against each other, but that’s what people want to see.”Lyles’s best distance is clearly the 200m – only seven men in history have run faster than his PB of 19.65 – but he admits it is much tougher in the 100m. “I can’t say I am the dominant figure because I do get beat in the 100m but I am OK with that because it makes the races more exciting,” he says.“If somebody dominates the whole time people might get a little bit turned off. But when they see competitive rivalry, people get more excited. I get really excited when people talk others up. I say: ‘OK, I’ve got some work to do. I’ve got to change some minds.’”Lyles does not look like a sprinter. He is only 5ft\u0026nbsp10in and sinewy rather than ripped but he has excellent genes, given his father, Kevin, was a 45.01sec 400m runner and his mother, Keisha, was an All‑American runner at college, and he has a ridiculously fast finish.“I don’t have big bulging muscles,” he concedes. “And it’s harder for me to get those first few steps out than some of the other guys. But my ability to turn over is very fast – and I have a unique ability to have a lot of endurance and be able to hold my top-end for longer than most people can.”That is something the large Birmingham crowd – and his rivals – are probably about to find out.Noah Lyles will compete in the 100m at the Müller Grand Prix Birmingham on Saturday.

That defensive prowess laid the platform for what followed in a blistering passage of play before half-time as they took control.The Saints bench, and in particular the young forward Jack Ashworth, swung the momentum in their favour and as they began to wrestle control of the contest it was Ashworth’s strong running which enabled the visitors to take the lead when Ben Barba’s fine cutout ball found Tommy Makinson.The winger’s superb finish, despite pressure from Tom Johnstone, was quickly followed by more great play from Ashworth, who freed Jonny Lomax for the Saints’ second try, Danny Richardson converting both to make it 12-0 in the visitors’ favour.Two tries in five minutes then became three in seven, with Makinson again producing a remarkable finish to extend the Saints’ lead: he claimed a towering Richardson kick before reaching over from close-range to touch down. Although Richardson missed the conversion, a game-changing period from the visitors had opened up a 16-point half-time advantage from nowhere.Wakefield responded well immediately after half-time though, reducing the Saints’ lead to just four points after tries for Kyle Wood and Pauli Pauli – the latter scoring while Trinity were still down to 12 men following Craig Huby being sent to the sin-bin.However, as Huby was preparing to return to the field, Theo Fages scampered over to restore a two-score lead for the Saints. The excellent Bill Tupou then set up a tense finish for the league leaders by scything through – but Luke Douglas and Regan Grace tries calmed the Saints’ nerves once and for all by grounding Danny Richardson’s kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a35c8297e406892995c790f605e171b6776464/1070_705_3186_1913/master/3186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea5142e2a562eebcd6ead56130b04cd","title":"the pin review dazzling comedy show edinburgh festival","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghTerrific skits and inventive gags mean the laughs come thick and fast in a delightful new hour from the sketch duoCleverness comes as standard from sketch duo the Pin. In the past, they have never quite shaken the suspicion of smugness and a sense, perhaps, that we’re buying all that flamboyant invention at the expense of warmth. No such danger with their new show, Backstage, which is simultaneously one of the most dazzling comedy shows in Edinburgh and a complete hoot. It’s probably no coincidence that here, more pronounced than before, Alex Owen and Ben Ashenden embrace the straight manfunny man dichotomy they have hitherto resisted.The conceit is that the Pin play second fiddle to another double act, Philip and Robin. After their support slot, Owen and Ashenden repair backstage to practise their sketches, snark about the audience and fantasise about taking over at the top of the bill. What follows is a giddy slice of Noises Off-style knockabout, overlaid with the Pin’s signature meta-comedy, as Owen, Ashenden, Philip and Robin chase one another on stage and off, identities get scrambled and a chair on the stage miraculously reappears – and vanishes from – behind the scenes.It’s as much comic play as sketch show, even while Owen and Ashenden slot in some terrific free-standing skits. The whistling joke is one for the ages the Scandi-noir spoof is irresistibly silly. And, like most of the Pin’s material, wholly surprising. They are operating at such a high level of inventiveness, they can afford to toy – as per the gag about Owen’s favourite Shakespeare play – with the audience’s expectations of a punchline. We are forever tantalised at the prospect of the next volte-face – it’s like watching a magic show.What’s delightful is how all this tricksiness is embedded in the cosily familiar conventions of vaudevillian farce. As an act, Philip and Robin are old-school – and so, too, is the Pin’s backstage caper, with slapstick fall guys bundled into cupboards and limbs extending from behind screens. There’s something satisfying, too, about watching Owen embrace his inner gormless idiot, while Ashenden takes on the exasperated foreman role, without stinting on the laughs – of which there are loads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12b513b0b3a64864866c7cac6066af381346cc10/0_111_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cba925dba95c6076eaddcef76fcd189","title":"the farm tatton park cheshire review","story":"Farming heritage, rare breed animals, a woodland trail and an honest approach to provenance are all part of this family day outThe Field to Fork story at the revamped working farm at Tatton Park was opened for the summer holidays. The £1.3m attraction, in the grounds of the country estate, aims to reconnect families with where their food comes from by bringing to life Cheshire’s farming history through heritage and hands-on events. Costumed actors bring to life characters from the farm’s past and there’s a mill, maize maze (seasonal) and farm machines to explore, too. The attraction includes a rare-breeds farm, play barn and woodland trail for little ones, plus visitors can swot up on agricultural skills, such as cheese-making and beekeeping. The Tatton estate also has a stately home, gardens and a deer park.Rare-breed animals take centre stage here, including the intriguingly named Yokohama long-tailed fowl and heritage-breed Silver Spangled Hamburg chickens. The farm has an adopt-an-animal scheme, which costs £20 a year, and helps towards conservation of its rare breed animals.Actually, the highlight is a visit to a Horrible Histories-style explanation of the slaughter process, where the opening salvo is a projected image of a pig hanging upside down from a winch. It’s a way of explaining how parts of animals are used for different products and the importance of good animal husbandry. It’s handled sensitively, with a focus on the educational aspect, rather than shock value, and set out the facts clearly. My two daughters found it more thought-provoking than upsetting.The Stables restaurant is self-service and has hot and cold snacks, and children’s lunch boxes (from £4.50) which can be filled with five items, including sandwiches, fresh fruit, cheese strips, yoghurt, crisps, cookies and fruit juice. The Gardener’s Cottage in the Victorian walled garden is more upmarket and serves posh afternoon teas (from £16.95pp), using estate-sourced produce. Better still, bring your own picnic to the farm, stocking up on local produce en route.There’s a small range on a farming theme, including toy tractors (£3.99), fluffy toy pigs (£10.95) and kids’ wellies (£8.50). A copy of Wisdom for Hen Keepers – 500 tips for Keeping Chickens was on sale for £4.99.It’s signposted from junction 10 of the M6 and junction 7 of the M56 in east Cheshire. It’s a 2½-mile walk from Knutsford railway station.It’s not the cheapest day out, with vehicle entry to the park costing £7 (free to walkers and cyclists), plus entry to the farm (adult £7, child £5, family £19, under 4s free) on top. A combined “Totally Tatton Ticket” costs £33 a family (two adults, three children) with entry to The farm, stately home and gardens but excluding parking.The farm is open Tuesday to Sunday (plus bank holidays), noon to 5pm (last entry 4pm). The park is open daily from 10am to 7pm.7 out of 10. Not cheap but it does offer a combination of educational attractions and great-outdoors exploration.

This documentary explores that question by following two women trying to find the families who gave them up for adoptionThe reason 26-year-old Ria wants to meet her birth mother, she says, is to “find out if I was brought into this world with love”. Searching for Mum: Sri Lanka (BBC Two) follows two women through the emotional and draining process of attempting to track down the families who gave them up for adoption in a country far away from the one in which they grew up. It is as frustrating as it is moving, touching on a wider scandal about enforced adoptions in Sri Lanka and the use of falsified documents to cover up coercion. It is also an honest and brave story about what it means to know one’s roots, and a complex examination of why many people consider this an essential part of their being.Ria’s story is the more straightforward, if only in comparison to the one with which it is paired. She has lived with her adoptive parents in Inverness since she was three weeks old. “I stuck out like a sore thumb, but I was completely happy,” she says of her childhood. Nevertheless, not knowing why she was given up for adoption has needled her, as has the paperwork that says her birth mother wants no contact. Articulate, thoughtful and wary, Ria explains that she feels stuck between two countries and two identities: “It doesn’t necessarily upset me, but it’s there.”With the help of Siri, a professional who makes a career out of navigating Sri Lankan paperwork and bureaucracy for adopted children seeking their parents, and after a few dead ends, Ria eventually comes to the village of her birth family. An uncle comes out to greet her, then her grandfather. She must wait until the next day to meet her mother, but when the moment comes it is simple, wordless and deeply moving. Sumitra, her mother, explains through tears why Ria had to be adopted. The father had left her and she was told they were too poor to care for her. She did not remember signing the paperwork, she said. She cried for three months after her daughter was taken. In the end, Ria finds what appears to be a form of peace.Rebecca’s story is less linear, less complete. She has been searching for her roots for a long time, having only discovered she was adopted when she was eight she found the papers, by mistake, in an airing cupboard. She is frustrated by a lack of records at every turn. Her birth does not appear to have been registered, as was often the way with unmarried mothers. She is angry at her adoptive parents, desperate for a connection to where she was born, almost unbearably optimistic in the face of setback after setback. Her story ends with a potential family. Her sense that maybe these are familiar eyes, that they have a “connection”, is shattered by a DNA test that proves otherwise. I hope that next week she finds some resolution, in whatever form it may take.Fans of the Ross Kemp school of television – hard men meet other hard men under circumstances of high stress, personal danger and frantic directions – will have been enjoying Meet the Drug Lords: Inside the Real Narcos (Channel 4), which ends on a surprisingly balanced note this week. Jason Fox – formerly of special forces, the host of SAS: Who Dares Wins and the kind of man that women of a certain age may refer to as “dishy” – has had incredible access to the day-to-day business of the real-life South American narcos who supply much of the world’s cocaine.It is high-octane and exhilarating, showing Fox and his crew in genuinely terrifying situations, such as when they are interrupted during an interview with a cocaine chef in a secret lab and he must, in military terms, peg it as quickly as possible. It also amps up the action-movie stuff, as helicopters on loan from the US air force are used to decimate a cocaine factory in the jungle.But it is not the showier scenes that stand out. Fox has a way with the people he meets: he asks the right kinds of questions he is sympathetic, understanding and curious. He talks to hitmen and discovers that, for all their posturing, they can’t sleep at night. He talks to smugglers, risking their lives every day for tiny sums of money, finding out why they do it, that many keep it secret from their families. It adds an extra layer of meaning to the question of the value of cocaine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f1fb173dba6662b06100fac4db2649bd67d33a3/0_32_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e09c4bdf61db00046b6956a9bbb66d6","title":"blocked by israel eight years palestinian mail arrives postal west bank letters parcels","story":"Palestinian postal staff begin sorting mail prevented from entering for up to eight yearsIsraeli occupying forces have allowed 10 tonnes of mail to be handed to Palestinian postal workers after preventing the letters and parcels from entering the West Bank for up to eight years. The Palestinian ministry of communications uploaded a photos to its Facebook page of large piles of white, blue and yellow bags in a room as employees worked through the masses of post.The undelivered mail was being sifted through in a sorting office in Jericho and included family photographs and personal letters as well as medicine and a wheelchair. Some packages had been marked as recorded delivery. A 2016 agreement that allowed Palestinians living under occupation to receive mail directly from Jordan – rather than through Israel – for the first time was never fully enacted. Israel let this shipment through in a one-time deal, officials said.The Palestinian telecommunications minister, Allam Mousa, said Israel was still delaying the implementation of the 2016] agreement and did not allow the movement of mail directly through Jordan, and by doing so was not complying with international resolutions.Mousa said the delays had cost Palestinian postal system thousands of dollars, pointing to high customs charges and hard-to-obtain permits. Some of the goods now being delivered were broken, he added, and postal staff were attaching notes to the deliveries to say Israeli authorities had released them in a damaged state.Ramadan Ghazawi, an official at the sorting centre, told Agence France-Presse that it would take staff two weeks to sort through and deliver the mail. Some items had been blocked for security reasons, while others had been stalled for administrative ones, he added.All entrances and exits to the West Bank, including to and from Jordan, are controlled by Israel, damaging the economy and restricting the freedom of movement for Palestinians.Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war with Jordan, Egypt and Syria. It left Gaza in 2005, but continues to maintain control over most of the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule.A note attached to the undelivered wheelchair said it was sent from Turkey three years ago and destined for Gaza. Geographically disconnected from the West Bank, a 10-year blockade by Israel means essential goods including fuel are often prevented from entering Gaza. Many people living there have never left.Israeli authorities confirmed the packages had been transferred.Cogat, the defence ministry unit coordinating Israeli government activity in the West Bank, said the release was part of confidence-building measures.The move had “allowed a one-time transfer of approximately 10.5 tonnes of mail that had been held in Jordan”, it said, adding the deal had not yet gone into force for future deliveries.Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9f644ad995eccac984934c4b02a6285b8c816da/0_346_4292_2576/master/4292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da035308dcc8753548ce5d068a959f0","title":"regreening niger how magical gaos transformed land","story":"Farmers in Niger are nurturing gao trees to drive Africa’s biggest environmental changeRain had come to nearby villages, but not yet to Droum in south-east Niger. The sand under its stately trees looked completely barren, but Souley Cheibou, a farmer in his 60s, was not worried. He crooked a finger, fished in the sand, and brought out a millet seed. In a week or two, this seed would germinate and sprout, and soon the whole field would be green.Cheibou’s peace of mind stemmed from the trees encircling him, which had been standing long before he was born. Despite appearances, these were not any old acacias. They were gao trees – known as winterthorns in English – with unique, seemingly magical powers.From the peanut basin of Senegal to the Seno plains of Mali, to Yatenga, formerly the most degraded region of Burkina Faso, and as far south as Malawi: gaos are thriving in Africa. And over the past three decades, the landscape of southern Niger has been transformed by more than 200m new trees, many of them gaos. They have not been planted but have grown naturally on over 5m hectares of farmland, nurtured by thousands of farmers.According to scientists, what has happened in Niger – one of the world’s poorest countries – is the largest-scale positive transformation of the environment in the whole of Africa. This is not a grand UN-funded project aiming to offset climate change. Small-scale farmers have achieved it because of what the trees can do for crop yields and other aspects of farming life.“It’s a magic tree, a very wonderful tree,” said Abasse Tougiani of Niger’s National Institute of Agricultural Research, who has travelled all over Niger studying Faidherbia albida – the gao’s Latin name.Shielded from the sun, crops planted under the canopy of a tree usually do not do well in the short term, although there can be longer-term benefits. That’s one reason why many west African rainforests have been decimated. But with gaos, it’s the other way round. The root system of the gao is nearly as big as its branches, and unusually it draws nitrogen from the air, fertilising the soil. And unlike other trees in the area, gao tree leaves fall in the rainy season, allowing more sunlight through to the crops at a key moment.Used along with mineral fertilisers, crop yields double under gaos, and the gao-nourished soil holds water better, ensuring a better crop in drought years.Counterintuitively, the great gao regreening is only happening in areas of Niger with high-density populations. With less space to expand into as more people are born, hard-up farmers are increasingly realising that the trees can regenerate degraded land.“It’s literally a story of more people, more trees,” said Chris Reij, a sustainable land management specialist. “The whole point is that the trees are not protected and managed by farmers for their environmental beauty, but because they are part of the agricultural production system.”Inadvertently, the farmers are also doing their bit to offset climate change. Trees are crucial for storing carbon, absorbing it out of the atmosphere. “In mature, fairly dense areas, you get 30 tons of wood per hectare. Half of that is carbon,” said Gray Tappan, a geographer.Efforts to restore 100m hectares of degraded African land by 2030 are underway. The ambitious Great Green Wall project to surround the Sahara desert with trees and other plants has changed beyond recognition after debate over whether desertification - the process by which soil loses its fertitlity - is real. Progress is slow. In Niger, where temperatures often reach the 40s, the trees create a cooler microclimate, and rabbits and jackals are coming back.But none of these grand political projects explains why gaos have caught on. The trees’ pods make very nutritious animal fodder, and fallen branches make good firewood, meaning Droum’s women and children – whose job it is to collect fuel for cooking fires – rarely have to venture further than a few kilometres to find it.Tales about how the gao came to be so revered abound. Legend has it that crimes against gaos have been taken very seriously since the mid-19th century. “If you touched a branch, you would go to jail,” Tougiani said. In splendid brocade robes and curly-toed velvet slippers, surrounded by self-portraits and stick-wielding guards dressed in red and green, today’s district chief in Droum takes a slightly softer approach.“It’s shameful to have to come before the chief and explain yourself. Often that’s punishment enough,” Maman Ali Kaoura said. Droum’s reoffenders face fines of between 5,000 to 10,000 West African CFA francs (£6.75-£13.50), a huge amount for hard-up farmers.A sense of ownership has been key in the regreening of Niger. Until the mid-1980s, every tree was considered to belong to the state. When this changed, regreening began, as people were happier to look after trees that belonged to them. In areas with the best cover, they organised patrols to protect their trees from passing farmers and neighbouring villagers seeking firewood.Once people discovered that “one gao was equal to 10 cows” for fertilising, as Tougiani put it, the tree’s popularity took off. Several schemes, including one where farmers with more than 50 gaos were paid 50 CFA for each one, helped it along.But their loyalty to their gaos could make areas around Zinder the most vulnerable to a disease that Reij and Tougiani have recently spotted killing trees near Niamey, the capital. If it spreads, the losses could be enormous, particularly in places where there is a near-monoculture of gaos.“I’m worried, because it’s green oil for farmers – it’s their wealth,” said Tougiani. “If they lose Faidherbia albida, they’ll lose their way of life. They’ll have to leave the village.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theFor Cheibou, losing his trees is unthinkable – they were his birthright. “I have nearly 100 gao trees in my fields, which I inherited from my father,” he said.

Many of the children were treated at a hospital supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Marta Rivas Blanco, an ICRC nurse, shares her account of the day.They came to the hospital in cars and ambulances. Dozens of children with an array of grisly wounds. Some were screaming, some were scared. Many went straight to the morgue.I’d like to say this was the first time I’ve treated so many civilians after an attack, but it’s not. I’ve been here too many times before, both in Yemen and in Mosul, Iraq.What happened last week in Saada, however, was unprecedented for me in that nearly all the victims were children. As part of an ICRC mobile surgical team, we work alongside Yemeni healthcare workers at the Talh hospital on a daily basis. Yemen’s health system has been decimated by conflict and it’s a challenging environment at the best of times. What happened on Thursday was the stuff of nightmares.A colleague called me while we were driving to the hospital in the morning. He told me there had been an attack and that we should expect an influx of patients. When he said most of them were children, my heart sank.It was intense. Very quickly the emergency room was full, as were the two extra emergency tents outside. You can’t imagine such a scene. We’d already enacted our mass casualty plan, so everyone knew what to do.The first thing was to triage the patients. The red cases – those with life-threatening injuries – went straight to the emergency room. They have to be treated immediately or they will die. The less severe cases went into the tents for treatment.When you’re in this moment, you lose track of time. You focus on your job and you don’t let emotions get in the way. For around four hours everyone was working flat out. Local staff, who were not supposed to be working, came in to help out. Even the cleaners were helping. You just do your best, but sometimes even that’s not enough.Two children died in the emergency room with me. The brutal truth is that you cannot save everyone. In total, 51 people died, including 40 children. Dozens more were injured, the majority of whom were children. There were a lot of children who had difficulty breathing, due to lung injuries caused by shockwaves from the blast. Some had fractures to the arms and legs, and broken glass had caused perforations to the skin. One small mercy is that there were no amputations. Physically, the children will recover. But I worry for their mental state. Many were in shock they had no idea what had just happened to them. One minute they were on a bus, the next they were in a hospital.The health system in Yemen is on the brink of collapse and Saada is a very poor area. There is little by way of psychological support. This attack could affect the children long after their wounds have healed.Funerals for some of the children were held on Monday. Those who are still in hospital are on the path to recovery. While it’s good to see wounds on the mend, the hospital is still full of children who should otherwise be at school, or outside playing. This conflict has robbed them of their childhood.I don’t expect we’ll get much of a break for the next fortnight. But that’s OK. To be here and to be able to help is deeply gratifying for me. On Monday I went to the office to take stock of the medical supplies. It’s in these quiet moments that you start replaying the images in your head – the anguish etched on those children’s faces, the sound of young voices screaming.Whether in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, or any other conflict, attacks on civilians are unacceptable and cannot be idly tolerated. International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects. But I’ve found myself treating civilians more times than I care to remember. That’s why I had to go to the office: to submit an order to replenish our stock of medicines and equipment. We have to be ready for the next time.Marta Rivas Blanco is part of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) mobile surgical team at Al-Talh hospital in Yemen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8292b60a352c3fd51bdf0825dfa58cb3193a8870/0_217_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2c0a563d2378238042b61694f1709e8","title":"uk playwrights condemn bombing of gaza theatre","story":"Caryl Churchill and National Theatre director bemoan ‘devastating loss’ after Israeli strikeLeading playwrights and directors in Britain have severely criticised the bombing of a major cultural centre in the Gaza Strip by Israel’s air force, calling it a “devastating loss for the already isolated community”.In a letter to the , 14 figures from UK theatre, including the director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, and dramatist Caryl Churchill, condemned the “total destruction” of the Said al-Mishal Culture Centre.“We support our dear friends and colleagues who describe ‘their great rage and deep pain’ at the obliteration of this symbol of Palestinian culture and identity as they mourn the destruction of one of the few large venues for theatre and music performances in besieged Gaza,” the group said.“Since its establishment in 2004, Al-Mishal served as a home for hundreds of plays, ceremonies, exhibits, musical performances and national ceremonies. It was the venue of choice for theatre companies in Gaza and a space for Gaza’s top musical acts.”Most recently, the centre hosted a joint performance with artists in the UK. At Home in Gaza and London, which ran in June and July, attempted to connect people living under severe blockade with British audiences.The multi-storey building was flattened on Thursday last week during a peak in violence, as Israel launched more than 150 airstrikes in Gaza and Palestinian militants fired more than 180 rockets and mortars into southern Israel.Three Palestinians were killed that day, including a pregnant woman, a toddler and a fighter from the armed wing of Hamas, the group that runs the enclave. Several Israelis were wounded.In an apparent reference to the cultural centre bombing, the Israeli army said at the time that its jets had targeted a five-storey structure which it said was “used by the Hamas terror organisation’s interior security forces for military purposes”.It shared a photo of the building and a video of the airstrike, showing an overhead view of the explosion. “The strike is an example of the (Israeli Defense Force’s) intelligence and operational capabilities, which will intensify as necessary,” it added.The centre was seen as a cultural landmark in Gaza, holding a theatre, a library and offices for artistic associations. It was also used as a recreation centre for children affected by the three wars waged between Israel and Hamas during the past decade. Artists working at the centre strongly denied Israeli claims of any Hamas military use.The British letter’s signatories also included Vicky Featherstone, artistic director of the Royal Court theatre, as well as Phyllida Lloyd, who directed the films Mamma Mia! and The Iron Lady. In 2009, shortly after the first Gaza war, Churchill wrote a 10-minute play on attitudes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“It is a devastating loss for the already isolated community,” the group said in the letter. “We are deeply shocked that this act of destruction has not been widely reported in the British press. We support all efforts to continue Al-Mishal’s mission and the campaign for the centre’s reconstruction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c3fd5b1993876d9b18f03b735f43f0c016cdc7/0_362_3450_2070/master/3450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84de791829e4725fed46aa334ee4ec6","title":"yemen school bus bombing one of 50 strikes on civilian vehicles this year","story":"Human Rights Watch says Saudi monitoring body set up to investigate civilian casualties fails to find fault in most casesThe bombing of a bus full of schoolchildren last week was just one of more than 50 airstrikes against civilian vehicles by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen so far this year, according to new data.The data also shows that the monitoring body set up in Riyadh purportedly to investigate incidents of civilian casualties has supported the Saudi military version of events in almost every case.The Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT) has not issued comprehensive statistics but has instead issued periodic press statements. And according to an analysis by Human Rights Watch (HRW), out of 75 incidents where civilian casualties were reported, JIAT has admitted Saudi rules of engagement may have been broken in only two.In 10 more cases, JIAT has conceded that civilians may have been killed in error and said that compensation would be paid, but human rights advocates said there was so far no sign of any payments being made.“None of the victims’ families we reached out to said they had been contacted,” said Kristine Bekerle, a HRW researcher, noting that the cases where compensation had been promised were up to two years old.The 9 August airstrike obliterated a bus carrying schoolboys on a field trip in northern Yemen, leaving 40 children and 11 adults dead. The Saudi government told the UN security council that the strike would be investigated – but described it as “a legitimate military action”, saying it had targeted “Houthi leaders who were responsible for recruiting and training young children, and then sending them to battlefields”.The schoolboys had been on the way to a cemetery where rebels were buried but survivors told journalists that was because it was one of the very few green spaces left in the whole of the northern Saada governorate. Parks and gardens have been destroyed in the relentless fighting.“They came to the hospital in cars and ambulances. Dozens of children with an array of grisly wounds,” Marta Rivas Blanco, an ICRC nurse at the Al Talh hospital where the victims were taken, wrote in an account of the day for the . “Some were screaming, some were scared, many went straight to the morgue.”Statistics collated by an independent monitoring group, the Yemen Data Project, suggest that the targeting of the schoolbus was part of a wider pattern. According to its records, there have been 55 airstrikes against civilian vehicles and buses in the first seven months of this year – a higher rate than in 2017.The coalition, whose other principal member is the United Arab Emirates, is under little international pressure to rein in its three-year bombing campaign and its stranglehold of trade routes.The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said he had dispatched a three-star US general to Riyadh to look into the bus bombing. Meanwhile, a congressional defence spending bill signed by Donald Trump on Monday includes a clause requiring the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to certify that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are taking steps to prevent civilian deaths. Without such certification, the US would stop refuelling Saudi warplanes involved in the bombing campaign.But the attack on the schoolbus was not mentioned in a state department account of a subsequent phone conversation between Pompeo and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has yet to refer to it at all.In the past, the US and UK governments – the coalition’s main arms suppliers – have pointed to the establishment of JIAT as evidence of an effort to reduce civilian casualties, and maintained their weapons sales. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single buyer of arms from both countries, accounting for about half the total UK and US sales, worth billions of dollars.In May, Reuters reported that the Trump administration had asked Congress to review the sale of 120,000 Raytheon guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and UAE. Yemeni journalists posted photos and videos of fragments of what they said was a Raytheon munition from the site of the schoolbus bombing.The US, UK and France, the third biggest arms exporter to the Middle East, have shielded their Gulf allies from serious diplomatic pressure at the security council. When Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Peru and Bolivia called for an emergency security council meeting on Friday to discuss the bus bombing, they were not joined by any of the five permanent members, although the UK, which currently holds the council presidency, scheduled the meeting.Kuwait, a member of the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, used its seat on the council to block any strong language. There was no joint press statement at the end of the session, but merely “press elements”, a weaker expression of opinion, which watered down the call by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for an “independent and prompt” investigation. The inquiry should be “credible and transparent”, the council members said, leaving open the possibility that the coalition members could investigate themselves.The UK’s response to the bus attack came in the form of a tweet posted by Alistair Burt, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, who said he was “deeply concerned” about reports of children’s deaths, but did not mention the attack was carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade said “the complicit silence from No 10 is a clear case of arms company profits being put above human rights and Yemeni lives”. Critics of US and UK policy argue that by continuing to arm the coalition while accepting whitewashed Saudi accounts of the civilian deaths, the two countries risk becoming legally complicit in war crimes.“When the Saudi-led coalition’s investigative process basically says they are not responsible for ninety-something percent of these airstrikes hitting civilians, it calls into question the legitimacy of that process,” said Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from California.This week Lieu wrote to the acting inspector general at the Pentagon calling on him to launch an investigation over whether US service members providing support for coalition air operations, or US officials selling arms to Saudi Arabia, “could be responsible for aiding and abetting war crimes”.The congressman told the : “I believe both the US and United Kingdom and other governments providing support to the Saudi-led coalition could be liable for war crimes.”Fabian Hamilton, the UK’s shadow minister for peace and disarmament, said: “As a permanent member of the UN security council, the UK government’s response to this horrific attack has been abysmal.“Failing to take action now means the government is presiding over the worst man-made humanitarian disaster of the 21st century,” Hamilton said. “Britain is currently playing a part in arming the Saudi-led coalition to the teeth, as it continues to violate international law, targeting civilians and sources of international aid.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598412.1534431517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"too soon christmas shop opens in dublin cork and limerick","story":"Brown Thomas opens its Christmas shop.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPictured at the launch of the Brown Thomas Christmas shop in Dublin were model Isabelle Traber and Hannah O’ Brien (4). Photo: Leon FarrellPhotocall Ireland.Ho ho nooooo, say it ain’t so. There are still 131 sleeps until Christmas and already Brown Thomas shops in Dublin, Cork and Limerick have decked the halls and are suggesting it is the season to be jolly. It is hardly much of a surprise that the high end retailer has opened its Christmas shops even before nation’s children have gone back to school as this is what it has done every year for the best part of a decade. And as with every other year the retailer was entirely unapologetic. “We open our Christmas shop every year in August which always proves to be very popular with customers,” BT’s managing director Steven Sealy said. He suggested that the store’s fake trees would be “in high demand from the beginning of the season” while its decorations “start to sell-out in early November”.One of the trees which is likely to attract considerable attention is a seven-and-a-half foot plastic tree festooned with 200 sparkling lights that can be up and running from out of the box in less than five minutes without so much as a single cross word about tangled Christmas lights spoken by anyone. At €550, the tree is not cheap but forward-thinking souls who bunow may be laughing in five or six years when the consequences of this year’s drought will be felt on the real tree market. The woman who has chosen the Miracle Tree is Woods, Edel Woods. She has been thinking about Christmas 2018 since before Christmas 2017 which must be terribly confusing.Like Sealy she is unapologetic about her role in making Wizzard’s wish that it be Christmas every day come a step closer to being an absolutely horrific reality. She said the BTs Christmas shop had become known for its “beautiful and unusual Christmas decorations and trees” and claimed that customers “love to snap up decorations whether it is to be organised or to build on a collection they already have.”Certainly shoppers The  spoke to seemed happy enough with the premature festivity. “I always like it,” said Elena Mihovia who is originally from Bulgaria but is living in Islandbridge. “Last August it was the same. It lifts people mood when they see Christmas in the store.”Dairin Pernet is Irish but lives in Switzerland and she was in the store with her four-year-old son stocking up. “I love it, “ she said. “It is so cute. This just conjures up all the nostalgia for me. And look, it is a small space, and Dublin is full of tourists and they will love it.”She was buying presents for her son’s teachers. “That must be the Swiss rubbing off on me,” she said. When asked if she had any concerns that her child might start counting down the days until Santa arrives because of the shop visit she said no. “He is still caught up in the back-to-school thing and he has a new Incredibles costume in this bag so that’s going to keep him occupied.” Aisling Creevey from Naas wasn’t so convinced. “It gets earlier and earlier doesn’t it,” she said. “I understand why people might give out but it’s nice to look at. I can’t get my head around back to school yet never mind Christmas, mind you I am a teacher.” She said she had no plans to buy anything. “I’ve had a look but it Christmas shopping really isn’t my agenda today.”It wasn’t on Michelle Clancy from Glasnevin’s agenda either. “I think it takes the novelty out of Christmas,” she said. “What is seldom is wonderful.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Family did not know when or where Joseph Gallagher was exposedG Morgan \u0026amp Sons claims Inspiredspaces Bundle 5 owes it \u0026euro196,000First response to report on \u0026lsquopredator\u0026rsquo priests in Pennsylvania by US grand juryUnsuccessful candidate for president of Igbo Union Dublin said what happened would not be \u0026lsquoout of place in Putin\u0026rsquos Russia\u0026rsquoDutch judge issues ruling in case over the right to wear a collander in a passport photoMartin O\u0026rsquoRourke shot dead as part of the bloody Kinahan Hutch feudState Examinations Commission cautions students about serious consequencesDevelopment follows concerted efforts to address disparity by education authoritiesMonaghan nun in UK warned of \u0026lsquoweird, uncanny silence\u0026rsquo from Ian Paisley ahead of visitMother tells the court she \u0026lsquohas not slept for two weeks\u0026rsquo following violent incidentThe remnants of the sub-tropical storm are due to hit the country this weekendA selection of questions put to our guidance counsellors about the 2018 Leaving Cert resultsTotal of 511,675 people waiting on an out-patient procedure in JulyBrown Thomas unapologetic about selling festive decorations and fake trees in AugustOwners granted injunctions against occupation that has been described as political protestCosgrave and de Valera deserve credit for preserving democracy in the new StateDisciplinary proceedings were brought after a passenger complained that he had been punched on the back of the head by a Luas staff memberChilean flamingo chicks hatch after 30-day incubation in Dublin"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598280.1534424193!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nine flamingo chicks born at dublin zoo and more on the way","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the chicks which hatched in Dublin Zoo.Nine flamingos chicks have been born at Dublin Zoo.The Chilean flamingo chicks hatched after a 30-day incubation and now join the 86-strong flock at the zoo.With a number of eggs still in the nest, keepers are eagerly awaiting several more hatchlings in the coming weeks, the zoo said in a statement.The Chilean Flamingo stands over a metre tall with a wing of up to 100cm.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMs Chambers, the party’s spokeswoman on Brexit, accused both parties of an “abdication of responsibility” in collapsing the Stormont institutions over the past 20 months. Speaking at the Parnell Summer School on the theme of ‘21st Century Democracy: Opportunities and Threats’, she said it was “remarkable” that the voices of Northern Ireland politicians were not being heard on Brexit. She pointed out that the only Northern Ireland representatives in Westminster are the DUP who are pro-Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted for the UK to remain in the EU. She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Atef SafadiEPAIsraeli occupying forces have allowed 10 tonnes of mail to be handed to Palestinian postal workers after preventing the letters and parcels from entering the West Bank for up to eight years. The Palestinian ministry of communications uploaded photos to its Facebook page of large piles of white, blue and yellow bags in a room as employees worked through the masses of post.The undelivered mail was being sifted through in a sorting office in Jericho and included family photographs and personal letters, as well as medicine and a wheelchair. Some packages had been marked as recorded delivery. Some items had been blocked for security reasons, while others had been stalled for administrative ones, an official said.A 2016 agreement that allowed Palestinians living under occupation to receive mail directly from Jordan – rather than through Israel – for the first time was never fully enacted. Israel let this shipment through in a one-time deal, officials said.The Palestinian telecommunications minister, Allam Mousa, said Israel was still delaying the implementation of the 2016 agreement and did not allow the movement of mail directly through Jordan, and by doing so was not complying with international resolutions.Mousa said the delays had cost the Palestinian postal system thousands of dollars, pointing to high customs charges and hard-to-obtain permits. Some of the goods now being delivered were broken, he added, and postal staff were attaching notes to the deliveries to say Israeli authorities had released them in a damaged state.Ramadan Ghazawi, an official at the sorting centre, told Agence France-Presse that it would take staff two weeks to sort through and deliver the mail. All entrances and exits to the West Bank, including to and from Jordan, are controlled by Israel, damaging the economy and restricting the freedom of movement for Palestinians. Israel captured and occupied the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war with Jordan, Egypt and Syria. It left Gaza in 2005, but continues to maintain control over most of the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule.A note attached to the undelivered wheelchair said it was sent from Turkey three years ago and destined for Gaza. Geographically disconnected from the West Bank, a 10-year blockade by Israel means essential goods including fuel are often prevented from entering Gaza. Many people living there have never left.Israeli authorities confirmed the packages had been transferred.Cogat, the defence ministry unit co-ordinating Israeli government activity in the West Bank, said the release was part of confidence-building measures.The move had “allowed a one-time transfer of approximately 10.5 tonnes of mail that had been held in Jordan”, it said. –  (Agence France-Presse contributed to this report)"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

She is a brand ambassador for the diet plan. It says a brand sponsoring an influencer to create a post without any control of the content would not have to be labelled as an advert. A number of celebrities including Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding and Cara Delevigne have previously made posts which might be in breach of the rules.Singer and actress Rita Ora, 26, who has over 13 million followers, posted a picture of herself on holiday in Jamaica captioned Rockhouse Hotel, naming accommodation in the beach resort of Negril. Another bikini shot was captioned Thank you @rockhousehotel.It is not yet known whether any of these celebrities are part of the CMA\u0027s latest investigation.The highest-paid Instagram influencers, including one star who gets £14,000 per postThe watchdog revealed it has written to a range of celebrities to gather more information about their posts and the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands. It is also asking the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation, and said it was particularly interested in hearing from people who had bought products which were endorsed on social media. George Lusty, the CMA\u0027s senior director for consumer protection, said: Social media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.So, it\u0027s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.Retail and Consumer industryQuadruple stabbing in London park in latest knife attack within city\u0026#39s \u0026#39murder mile\u0026#39Chickens run wild around Norfolk housing estate leaving posties scared to deliver their mailCriminal prosecutions fall to record low despite crime reaching all-time highPope Francis expresses \u0026#39shame and sorrow\u0026#39 over Pennsylvania paedophile priest scandal Dreaded fall armyworm pest that devastated African crops found for the first time in IndiaBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent finalist who sang in memory of her dead son stabbed to death in BatterseaSir Patrick Stewart quits Labour Party and reveals \u0026#39awkward\u0026#39 encounter with Jeremy CorbynAverage GP now works 3.5 days a week -

Imam, Mustafa Graf, appears to call for military or armed jihad in the recording obtained by BBC News.It is unclear whether Abedi – or any family members - attended the mosque on the day of the audio recording, but he is thought to have bought a ticket for the Ariana Grande concert 10 days later.Ariana Grande, onstage in white, performs at the One Love Manchester tribute concert in Manchester, Sunday, June 4, 2017.After the arena bombing Didsbury Mosque called for anyone with information about the bombing to contact the police and attempted to distance itself from the attacker.According to the BBC News at least five men who have attended prayers at the mosque have either travelled to Syria or have been jailed for terrorism offences.The trustees said none of these men had visited Didsbury Mosque.The sermon by Mustafa Graf, which was delivered at the time of the bombing of Aleppo, includes prayers for “Mujahideen” – a term often used for a group fighting armed jihad abroad.We ask Allah to grant them Mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory, he is reported to have said.Elsewhere Graf says, “Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation”, it is claimed.In another passage he allegedly says “now it is time to act and do something”.The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations, with Graf at one point saying “the whole world, including Europe, America, what is the so-called civilised world” is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria.“They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. Well in fact they helped Iranian, Russian and others to kill Muslims over there.”BBC News played the audio for two Muslim scholars who said they both believe the language of the sermon represents a call for armed jihad.He\u0027s giving them the narrative of them against us”, says Islamic scholar Shaykh Rehan, “He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action.The jihad he\u0027s referring to here is actually being on the battlefield, there\u0027s no if\u0027s and no buts in this.He\u0027s giving them the narrative of them against us”, he continues. “He is psychologically and practically brainwashing young people into either travelling or to do something to take action.He goes on to say, “I have known the Islamic discourse for pretty much 40 years, from being a child in this country and worldwide, and the Mujahidin are the group fighting armed jihad”.The  contacted Didsbury Mosque but Imam Mustafa Graf was unavailable for comment.Please review our commenting policyQuadruple stabbing in London park in latest knife attack within city\u0026#39s \u0026#39murder mile\u0026#39Chickens run wild around Norfolk housing estate leaving posties scared to deliver their mailCriminal prosecutions fall to record low despite crime reaching all-time highPope Francis expresses \u0026#39shame and sorrow\u0026#39 over Pennsylvania paedophile priest scandal Dreaded fall armyworm pest that devastated African crops found for the first time in IndiaBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent finalist who sang in memory of her dead son stabbed to death in BatterseaSir Patrick Stewart quits Labour Party and reveals \u0026#39awkward\u0026#39 encounter with Jeremy CorbynAverage GP now works 3.5 days a week -

Chinese has become more popular among sixth formers than German for the first time – with 3,334 students taking the subject\u0026nbspthis year compared to 3,058 students who sat exams in the European language\u0026nbsp.A-level Chinese – which saw a rise of 8.6 per cent in entries compared to 2017 – has bucked the\u0026nbsptrend of students moving away from modern foreign languages in sixth form. The number of students opting to study\u0026nbspGerman, French and Spanish has fallen by 7.9 per cent, new figures from exam boards show.Entry rates for German were down by 16.5 per cent on last year, while entries for French declined by 8 per cent to 8,713 and entries for Spanish dropped by 4 per cent to 8,255.Suzanne O’Farrell, curriculum and assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We’re seeing German just moving into extinction really. It is in severe decline.”The move towards Chinese at A-level comes after the government launched a £10m Mandarin Excellence Programme – which is aiming for 5,000 young people to become fluent Mandarin speakers by 2020.Mandarin Chinese is the first language of over 1.25 billion people worldwide, and fluency in the language is widely considered to be useful in an increasingly global economy.Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, said\u0026nbspthe continued decline in pupils taking a modern language A-level in the first place was a “real concern”.“Student perceptions that languages are more difficult and less important than other subjects need to be tackled,” he said.A-level results 2018 – in picturesStudents celebrate their A Level results from Ark

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/11/rogue-planet.jpg  width= 800  height= 600  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/11/rogue-planet.jpg","title":"galaxies oldest universe discovery stars space milky way earth big bang","story":"Created with Sketch.‘Finding some of the very first galaxies that formed in our universe ...\u0026nbspis the astronomical equivalent of finding the remains of the first humans that inhabited the Earth’Click to followThe Independent OnlineThe ultra-faint satellites are among the most ancient galaxies in the universeIn the depths of space, astronomers have discovered galaxies that were some of the first ever to form in the universe.Identifying these 13 billion-year-old cosmic entities has been compared to finding “the remains of the first humans that inhabited the Earth”.The relatively small “satellite” galaxies, including Segue-1, Bootes\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspand Ursa Major I, are orbiting the\u0026nbspMilky Way, but scientists did not previously realise quite how old they were.“Finding some of the very first galaxies that formed in our universe orbiting in the Milky Way’s own backyard is the astronomical equivalent of finding the remains of the first humans that inhabited the Earth,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, director of Durham University’s Institute for Computational Cosmology.In a study published in the Astrophysical Journal, Professor Frenk and his colleagues describe two satellite galaxy populations that together tell the story of the early universe.Scientists think the first atoms only formed when the universe was 380,000 years old.These atoms clumped together to form clouds, which gradually cooled and settled into the “halos” of dark matter that had emerged from the big bang.This sparked a period of the universe’s history known as the “cosmic dark ages” that lasted 100 million years.Cooling hydrogen atoms inside the halos brought this period to an end with a flash as the gas became unstable and started\u0026nbspforming stars.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

This allowed them to estimate the formation times of these galaxies.Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe mission launches succcessfully on second attemptTheir findings agree with the current model for the development of the universe, known as the “Lambda cold dark matter model”.“A nice aspect of this work is that it highlights the complementarity between the predictions of a theoretical model and real data,” said Dr Sownak Bose of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, who led the research.“A decade ago, the faintest galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way would have gone under the radar.“With the increasing sensitivity of present and future galaxy censuses, a whole new trove of the tiniest galaxies has come into the light, allowing us to test theoretical models in new regimes.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/11/jupiter-surface.jpg","title":"jupiter saturn extreme conditions laser space hydrogen gas deuterium solar system","story":"Created with Sketch.Hydrogen gas inside Jupiter and Saturn is subjected to pressures millions of times greater than on Earth, turning it into a metallic liquidClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe hydrogen gas inside Jupiter is subjected to pressures 6 million times higher than Earth’s atmosphereExperiments with the world’s biggest laser have given scientists fresh insights into Jupiter and Saturn, the largest planets in our solar system.Inside these giant planets, the hydrogen gas that forms a key part of their structure is subjected to pressures and temperatures 6\u0026nbspmillion times higher than Earth’s atmosphere.Under these extreme conditions, hydrogen stops behaving like a gas and instead is squeezed until it takes on the properties of a liquid metal.To understand this process, researchers made use of the National Ignition Facility in California, the largest and most advanced laser in the world.They fired powerful beams\u0026nbspat a gas sample, raising it to a pressure similar to that found on Jupiter.In doing so, they watched as hydrogen turned from an invisible gas to a transparent liquid, which then turned black as the pressure mounted even further and ultimately resembled a reflective metallic substance similar to aluminium.“Arguably we have known about the existence of this metallic state of hydrogen for roughly 100 years, and it has been measured for around 25 years,” Dr Stewart McWilliams of the University of Edinburgh told The Independent.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Dr McWilliams said their research adds another piece to this on-going puzzle.“We are mapping the path hydrogen takes from a gas to the conditions we might see in the centre of Jupiter, and ultimately this will tell us how we reach conditions in the centre of stars – which are even more extreme than those we studied,” he explained.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social

Independent OnlineThe Advertising Standards Authority has intervened in a number of cases were rules have been breached, including one post by Millie MackintoshSocial media stars promoting goods on Instagram, Snapchat and other social media platforms are being probed by the competition regulator over concerns that paid advertisements are not being properly declared.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation on Tuesday into the labelling of online endorsements.Some celebrities and influencers have a considerable amount of commercial power thanks to millions of followers who watch their channels to see where they go on holiday, what they wear, which products they use, the books they read and more.This makes online endorsements from celebrities and influencers valuable to brands trying to reach target audiences and boost sales.But the watchdog fears some influencers are flouting consumer protection law which requires that any reward received for an endorsement, is made clear.If celebrities do not label their posts properly, fans or followers may be led to believe that an endorsement represents the star’s own view, rather than a paid-for promotion, the CMA\u0026nbspsaid.They are then more likely to place trust in that product than they would otherwise have been, the watchdog said, as they think it has been recommended by someone they admire.The five biggest fashion influencers from this year’s Love IslandThis LA mural is reserved for social media influencersLuxury hotel overwhelmed by influencers asking for free roomsFitness

cosmetics, a car, or a holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.So, it’s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product

Independent\u0027s campaign for a Final Say referendum on BrexitBritish steelworkers today throw their weight behind The Independent’s campaign for a Final Say referendum on Brexit. \u0026nbspThe Community union – representing some 30,000 workers in total – calls on Theresa May to “do the right thing” and allow the British public to determine their own future.In a further significant development in the drive for a new referendum, The Independent and the People’s Vote campaign are joining forces for a mass march through central London later this year.The alliance will see the two organisations mobilise activists and media across the country to capture the growing tide of opinion that a further referendum on Brexit must be held.Polls show fast increasing support for the idea amid deepening Tory isions, doubts that Ms May can secure parliamentary backing for her plans and meagre public support for her approach.Relations between UK and EU negotiators have also descended into a new state of paranoia this week, with Brussels not denying reports that its officials believe they are being bugged by British spies.It is against this backdrop that Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss writes exclusively for The Independent, saying: “In June 2016, the British public gave our government a mandate to go and negotiate a withdrawal from the European Union.“Exactly what that looked like was unclear, but Theresa May told us she would go in and negotiate a deal that is in the best interests of British workers and their families.“It now seems that such a deal is unachievable or may not exist. That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

voteIt received backing from British film star Dominic West today, who said: “Please sign the petition, join us on our march, and let’s get a people’s vote to say that we won’t be dictated to.”The gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable

Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg","title":"ilhan omar wins minnesota democratic primary victory speech watch","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,\u0027 she tells crowdClick to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar, who is likely to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress, made history on Tuesday by winning a seat in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.The politician garnered national attention just two years ago after becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota - unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,” she told a crowd of supporters after her win.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressTransgender candidate Christine Hallquist makes history in VermontAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Kaniela Ing in Hawaii primaries“And today, today, I still think about her and I think about the kind of hope and optimism all of those eight-year-olds around the country and around the world get from seeing your beautiful faces elect and believe in someone like me.“So I humbly thank you.

South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China.

Cyclists should face same punishment as drivers, says motoring lawyer                 Car tax changes could see YOU charged based on the amount of miles ...The revised energy labels for tyres strengthen the requirements on fuel efficiency, noise and safety, and will apply to tyres on all road-using vehicles including cars, vans and lorries.EU officials say the new labelling will be beneficial for the environment by increasing fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\u0026nbsp It will lead to CO2 savings equivalent of removing almost four million passenger cars from EU roads per year by 2030, according to Brussels estimates.The RAC last night backed the new labelling system. RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: \u0026ldquoStrengthening the tyre labelling regulations is good news for UK motorists and road safety generally.Currently, there is no requirement for tyre fitters to show labels at the point of purchase so motorists are oblivious to the pros and cons of the tyres they are buying.As a result few motorists are shown the labels when buying tyres, leaving them completely in the dark about the three ratings of fuel efficiency, wet grip and passing noise.Updating the regulations should fix this by making it mandatory for tyre labels to be shown to motorists in all situations.\u0026ldquoInformation on tyres\u0026rsquo snow and ice performance is going to be included which will be very beneficial.The labels are also being future-proofed as the amended regulations allow for the addition of other useful information such as ratings for mileage, wear and a potential indication for re-treaded tyres.                Bulgarian jailed for Ayrshire crash that killed pensioner                British motorist lands \u0026pound36,000 in speeding fines in just FOUR hours...The International Tyre Manufacturers\u0027 Association has also backed the proposals.In a statement to the EU earlier this year, the association\u0027s president Alfred Graham said: \u0026ldquoITMA is fully supportive of any measure that improves tyre safety, an objective the introduction the tyre-labelling regulation sought to achieve.If that means more can be done to increase motorists\u0026rsquo awareness and understanding of the information on the labels, ITMA will gladly play its part.A critical element of the scheme was to inform consumers of the relative value and environmental benefits of the tyres they are considering buying, so they might be able to make an informed purchasing decision.Achieving that is essential if further performance ratings are to be added to the labelling, a proposal which ITMA also believes has merit, especially for winter and re-tread tyres.Fundamentally, of course, the accurate and consistent assessment of tyre performance is critical and to the benefit of all parties.Should viable means to enhancing existing practises be found, ITMA would once again be supportive of such changes.

Don’t they know many thousands of people agree with him? Or do they chose to again ignore the people of this country? Any movement on Boris from the out-of-touch Government will cost them dear.SO Dominic Grieve has threatened to quit Parliament if Boris Johnson became PM. I can think of no better reason for wishing him success.BANG on Boris, about the burka. It being worn in public is scary for children who see it.FREEDOM of speech must not be compromised – and there can be no question of legal action being taken against Boris Johnson, it would be prejudiced by all the attacks on him.THIS week it has been especially hard to be a Muslim woman. Apparently I am not getting the joke, I’m over sensitive, bullied, oppressed, unintegrated, politically motivated, dividing Britain – this list goes on. Perhaps Boris Johnson’s Etonian education did not enable him to understand that in polite society it’s rude to comment with ridicule on the way people dress.ONE thing critics of Boris Johnson’s burka comment overlook is the impact of burka-wearers on those who are deaf and rely on seeing facial expressions, and lip-reading.THE do-gooders complaining about Boris are fanning the flames of hatred by highlighting issues that one wouldn’t really think about. Talk about “integration” appears to be one-sided and discriminatory towards the indigenous people. There is some equilibrium lacking in our “fair, just and equal” land of ours.WHILE I am not sure Boris used a good choice of words likening women in burkas to pillar boxes, he was right that we are frightened by what it represents. We must not destroy Boris, he is good for the people of this country, he cares. He must also be allowed to speak honestly, he has nothing to apologise for.LIGHTEN up, Boris spoke the thoughts of many millions of Brits. If making a gaffe was against the law, Prince Philip could have been banged up in the Tower of London on many occasions during the last 50 years. He wrote the book on it.Boris might have an agenda – what politician doesn’t? – but this mustn’t mean people don’t have a right to voice criticism. Face veils in public, and burkas, are not religious requirements and we must have the right to criticise the wearers.IF I was Boris Johnson, I would agree to attend the diversity training some have suggested . . . and then tear the training session to pieces.I SAW Ranvir Singh berating her guests on morning TV for daring to agree with Boris Johnson? I wonder what her bosses would say if she suggested that she presented her programme wearing a burka. I think we all know the answer to that.PHIL GROWDENNOTHING Theresa May says can be taken at face value. Not so long ago, she promised to stop the witch-hunt of British soldiers, who have seen action and survived in many parts of the world. However, the victimisation of our veterans continues unabated. They are now joined by Boris Johnson, who has frequently ignited the Prime Minister’s wrath and must therefore, be thrown to the wolves.A BUS company has apologised after a driver told a woman to remove her niqab. So would a bank apologise if a security guard asked a man to remove his ski mask?HOW would I stand as a Christian male finding a Muslim lady, dressed in a burka, having a heart attack? Would I be allowed to remove her veil to perform mouth-to-mouth?THE controversy surrounding Boris Johnson’s burka comments has reached ridiculous heights. Police conducting an investigation. Really?IF Theresa May had the guts to ban the burka like a lot of other countries, we might not be having this discussion about what Boris Johnson said.SOMETHING featureless with a rectangular hole in it can resemble a letter box, there’s probably one on your front door, go and have a look. It has also been known for the person inside to be a terrorist, not an innocent woman. Stop being so pathetic, have a sense of humour, act like adultsI READ about a motorcyclist at a filling station having to remove his crash helmet while a woman (who could have been a criminal’s getaway driver) filling up at the pump next to him was wearing a burka. Meanwhile Boris’s remarks are causing hysteria.I HAVE been visiting garden centres and supermarket car parks in my car, which is bedecked with Brexit stickers, asking many people their opinion on the Boris situation. For Boris, I find there is a great deal of love out there. For the Chequers “deal” there is none.IT’S true that Boris Johnson has used strong language but Muslim terrorists are doing far worse things than robbing banks, by committing terrorist atrocities. It would be a sad day when the Muslim community can’t take such a comment, especially when many Muslim women, in my view, do not want this clothing themselves.IT’S confirmed, lunatics are ruining the country. We have the enemy (EU) knocking art the door and all the idiots can find to discuss is Boris Johnson’s perfectly fair comment. If it wasn’t so serious it would be funny. Brexit should be top of the agenda.THERE are easily as many people who agree with BoJo’s comments as those who don’t. So why is it those who don’t will instigate an investigation, leaving those who do without a voice? Even senior Muslims and imams have said that the burka is not a requirement in Islam, so why is it we only tend to listen to those who are offended?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Last Leg is a television safe space, the authentic voice of the PC establishment and as predictable as the sun rising in the morning.So you knew, long before Friday’s transmission, that they’d be targeting Boris, who is a thousand times funnier and edgier than anyone on this show, in his own way.Nearly a whole working week host Adam Hills and his two mates had to prepare some decent material as well, and this was the best three professional comedians could do.Alex Brooker: “The burka is an item of clothing worn by a human being, the other is a postbox, you f***ing idiot.”Adam Hills: “I’d much rather sit next to a person in burka than a p***k in a suit.”Josh Widdicombe: “Theresa May has only just realised Boris is a t**t, so she should apologise as well.”On and on it went, for 12 minutes and 54 seconds, a figure I mention because I’ve had the clock on this lot, and if you want to know exactly how much of a toss they really give about religious sensitivities then it’s best measured by the fact this series of The Last Leg has devoted just 65 hand-wringing seconds to the anti-Semitic poison infecting the Labour Party.It was crammed hurriedly into the previous episode, which was worth watching just to see Adam Hills describe Corbyn’s handling of this crisis as “a faux pas”, (which isn’t French for “shameful cluster-f***”) and the C4 audience react with evident discomfort because he’d drawn attention to the Labour leader’s failings and, therefore, broken one of comedy’s secret and golden rules.If you doubted these rules exist, incidentally, then ever the virtue-signalling fool, Adam Hills was good enough to spell them out for us on Friday.“Every religion should be open to ridicule . . . but you kind of need to be in the club.“Alex and I can make jokes about disabilities as we’re technically disabled.”Boris, he then explained, can’t make jokes about burkas, ’cos he’s “a white Etonian”, nor could comedy giant Rowan Atkinson defend him, as he was “a white man who lives in Oxford and drives an F1 car”.Even if we ignore the fact he’s assumed that all Muslims are black, something pretty staggering is going on here.For Mary Whitehouse, in all her pearl-clutching glory, never imagined anything quite as Draconian and controlling as this form of satirical Apartheid.Adam Hills has a point, though, when he uses the word “club”. That’s exactly what television comedy has become.A closed, left-wing shop where you don’t even bother joining the audience unless you follow the rigid “Tories and Brexit are evil” party line.This is not creating comedy, it’s policing it, and also the reason why applause has replaced laughter on all those Channel 4 and BBC news satires which have failed to realise there is only one simple rule to be observed when creating these shows: Make it funny, dumbo.I would suggest, at this point, Adam Hills gets off his moral high horse, for once, and gives this “funny” idea a go.But then I could also ask Boris to have a crack at anchoring the British women’s 4x100m relay team to gold at the next Olympics, wearing a burka, and I’d know there was only the remotest chance of one ever happening.Run Boris, run.MEANWHILE, back on Channel 4’s Meet The Drug Lords: Inside The Real Narcos, Jason “Foxy” Fox was with the Colombian navy this week and desperate for a look inside one of the incredible home-made submarines they’d confiscated from drug-smugglers.“Is it locked?”“Yes.”And there’ll be more Bafta-worthy action from Foxy and his forward-planning department this week, I’m sure.EVER since it discovered that Danny Dyer was the rightful heir to the English throne, Who Do You Think You Are? has been struggling to find a purpose, or indeed a celebrity, who could see the bigger picture.That special someone who would acknowledge history’s great events with more than a few “wows” and shrugs and not think their own career made all of their ancestors’ suffering worthwhile.Finally, last night, they found him.Judge Robert Rinder, who as well as having the best brain at ITV (Luna the Labrador off This Morning has the second best) also turns out to be a natural television journalist, telling the story of his maternal great-grandfather, Israel, and his beloved grandfather, Morris, simply, beautifully and without ever letting the details overwhelm him.The former fled revolutionary Latvia at the turn of the last century.The latter’s entire family was wiped out in Treblinka’s gas chambers.Yet he somehow survived the Buchen-wald, Theresienstadt and Schlieben concentration camps and made it to Britain, which offered him salvation, friendship, justice and, above all, a sense that “life is worth living” that has been passed down through eternally grateful generations.It’s a remarkable story, so if you missed it, try to catch tonight’s repeat (BBC1, 11.25pm).SCENES and characters the viewers are unlikely to forget in a hurry on the final episode of BBC2’s wonderful Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.First stop, the President’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida, where Ed spent the most uncomfortable night of his life, since Strictly, at a one-year-in-office party for Trump, with Toni Holt Kramer and a group of fans who were called The Trumpettes, but could well have been the provisional wing of The Golden Girls.If you thought they were a bit sinister, though, he was then off squirrel hunting in the forests of Georgia with two hillbillies who might not have been plucking banjos but they certainly had the mad cackling laughs and slightly unsettling line in hospitality.“Are you ready to be a man today, Ed?” asked one, as you began to wonder if he could escape with his dignity intact, let alone blend in with the local gene pool.Then he suddenly reappeared – and this was a masterstroke – wearing a Norwich City scarf.Scrub everything I ever said about Ed Balls.The man’s a diplomatic genius.Sent in by Rob Milner, East Yorkshire.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the party will look at this I am sure extremely forcefully at the next conference.Lets wait and see what conference decides.“Theres always a rule in politics: if youre on the front pages for too long you become the story and thats not good because you miss all the good and effective things that the Labour Party is doing in terms of policy and holding this government to account.”Host Julia Hartley-Brewer asked her: “Do you think that a man who lays wreaths at the tombs of terrorists who have killed innocent people is fit to be the British Prime Minister?”But Ms Moon would only reply: “That will be a decision for the British people.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Around 46 per cent of 25 to 34 year-olds now live in private rentals as house prices rocket.Some 80 per cent of the tenancies in England and Wales are set at six or 12 months.Charities warned this leaves tenants at the risk of eviction at short notice- and demanded a change.Shelter chief Polly Neate last night said the Government’s decision was “very good news” that would transform the lives of many struggling to make ends meet.She said: “The current renting system is a complete mess, with families teetering on the edge of blink-and-you-miss-it six-month contracts – barely enough time to set your broadband up, let alone see your kids through school.“This problem will not be fixed by giving landlords a tax break to coax them into doing what everyone should be doing anyway.”Shelter earlier this week said 55 per cent of private renters believe longer tenancies would improve their situation.And they claimed two-thirds of renters would think better of a political party that brought in longer contracts.GOT a story?

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If they go on to university they incur debts of over £50,000 and will be paying back their loans well into middle age. And in a number of cases they end up with degrees that dont get them into graduate jobs.On the other hand, degree-level apprenticeships are almost non-existent with less than 10,000 available each year compared with over 300,000 university places. There is effectively no viable alternative to university.Jeremy Clarkson had some words of advice for students who fell short of what they hoped to get.He tweeted: Dont worry if your A-level grades arent any good. I got a C and 2 Us.And Im sitting here deciding which of my Range Rovers to use today.And ITV news anchor Alastair Stewart also wished students good luck.He wrote: However you do, remember: in 5 years they wont matter too much in ten, not at all in 20, theyll probably be called something else.Boys have outperformed girls at the top A-level grade for the first time since it was introduced in Northern Ireland.They overtook girls by 0.4 per cent at the A* grade, which was first awarded in 2010.The performance gap between the genders also narrowed at the A*-A grade boundary, and it follows concerted efforts to address the disparity by education authorities.Last year, 26.3 per cent of A-levels scored an A or A*, national figures showed, and the results were predicted to be broadly similar again this year.There have been major changes to A-levels in England, with a move away from coursework and modular exams throughout the course.A Department for Education spokesman said university isnt for everyone and the Government does not want one route to a career to be considered better than any other.That is why we are transforming technical education in this country to put it on a par with our amazing academic system, he said.Students who havent got the results they hoped for can try their luck through clearing.The process works by helping students find out what university courses still have places remaining.Hopefuls are able to search for a course against the subject they are interested in, or the university they want to head to."},{"url":null,"title":"a level results day memes twitter","story":"Teens have been sharing their funny reactions to the big day on under the hashtag #alevelresults2018 -

It’s like trying to put up shelves using sellotape.And that matters because Italy’s various mafias – Cosa Nostra (our thing) in Sicily, the ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria and the Camorra in Naples – are all experts at winning building contracts.And their hold doesn’t stop there.Match-fixing and ticket sales in football, waste disposal agreements as well as drug and people smuggling have all been lucrative streams of income for the underworld gangs.The system has been the same for decades: politicians receive votes and kickbacks from criminal gangs who are awarded the contracts from huge construction projects.Many people who have interfered in rigged tender processes, like Vincenzo Passiarello in 1998, have been killed.Long gone are the Hollywood stereotypes of a thug with a tommy gun and a trilby. Nowadays most mafiosi wear suits and are indistinguishable from ordinary businessmen.The only difference is the size of their empires.The scale of the corruption is so great that 281 town or city councils have been dissolved by Italian authorities since 1991 because of Mafia infiltration.Often that infiltration only emerges after years of painstaking surveillance by the the Italian police.Construction appeals to the Mafia because the huge sums involved enable the laundering of dirty drugs money.The many sub-contracts mean that a criminal gang can find itself hugely empowered, responsible for the hiring and firing of thousands of workers at a time when youth unemployment in Italy bounces around 30 per cent.Costs are kept low not just through the use of poor building materials but also through strong-arm management: unions are invariably excluded from work sites, and safety inspectors intimidated or bought off.It takes a brave man or woman to point out the Mafia’s shoddy workmanship.There are, experts say, many more councils where criminal infiltration still hasn’t been discovered.One of the main advantages of infiltrating the construction industry is that it enables the Mafia to disguise itself as a legitimate, respectable business. Since the mid-1990s – when the Mafia planted bombs on the Italian mainland and blew up Sicilian investigators – it has deliberately pursued a strategy of invisibility.As one of Italy’s anti-Mafia priests said recently: “the Mafia is very able to camouflage itself, to infiltrate into legal spaces.”In 2010, anti-Mafia investigators confiscated €1.5billion (around £1.35 billion) from Cosa Nostra’s current “don of dons”, the fugitive Matteo Messina Denaro. Much of that figure was linked to construction firms.Although it’s often the cause of disasters, the Mafia is also the beneficiary of them.Each time a devastating earthquake hits the country, criminal gangs move in on the reconstruction efforts.Franco Roberti, for four years head of Italy’s anti-Mafia directorate, told La Repubblica newspaper this week: “The risk of infiltration is always high. Post-earthquake reconstruction is a tasty morsel for criminal organisations and business interests.”The worry now is that hundreds of structures throughout Italy could be at risk.Legambiente, an anti-Mafia pressure group, has warned that weakened cement has been used at Trapani and Palermo airports in Sicily, as well as in schools, car parks, bridges and motorways throughout the peninsula.Back in 2009, in a situation eerily similar to this week’s bridge collapse, 37 people lost their lives during flash floods in the Sicilian city of Messina. Buildings simply collapsed in the rain because inadequate cement had been used in the construction of houses.Construction is only one of the Mafia’s revenues streams. Drug-dealing still represents a cash-cow, but in recent years criminal gangs have also made huge amounts from the exploitation of migrants: one wiretap from 2014 overheard a Rome mafiosi saying to a colleague: “do you have any idea how much one can earn through immigrants? Drug-trafficking yields less.”Apart from drugs- and people-smuggling, the Mafia is also adept at siphoning off European Union funding. The murder of the Slovakian journalist, Ján Kaliac, earlier this year is believed to have been a professional hit carried out because he was investigating Italian businessmen from Calabria who were embezzling EU funds.The other big-earner for criminal gangs is waste disposal. Here, like construction, it’s easy to make money if corners are cut.And through messing with rubbish collection – leaving it rotting on street corners at the height of the summer heat and the tourist season – organised criminals are able to hold cities hostage, making demands for contracts to be renegotiated.Not even Italy’s favourite sport is immune from the Mafia. Match-fixing in football is frequent in Italy, especially in the lower leagues.Every year or two there’s a scandal when it emerges that betting syndicates have made huge profits after bribing players to chuck games: The most recent case was in 2011, when dozens of teams and players colluded to arrange results, taking money from, and making it for, organised crime.The Mafia has even attempted to muscle in on the huge money to be made from ticket sales.In 2016 investigators in Turin discovered that the Calabrian Mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, was procuring free tickets from Juventus in order to sell them on at huge profits: ticket-touting was estimated to yield €30,000 on match day.Ciccio Bucci, the man caught in the middle between Juventus and the Calabrian mafia, committed suicide in suspicious circumstances the day after being questioned by investigators.After Tuesday’s tragedy, infrastructure is now at the top of the Italian political agenda. If the taps are turned on again, you can be sure that the people who caused the problems will be offering, once again, to solve them.Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

To my club, teammates, supporters and most importantly the police.They have a tough and vital job and Im mortified that, earlier this week, I acted in a way that I hugely regret. I am truly sorry.I would also like to put on record the words of the Magistrate Sarah Fitz who publicly stated that it was a minor incident and a fine is more than sufficient.I was wrong to argue with a bouncer and pull on his camera tie. I was also wrong to resist arrest.This is why I pleaded guilty to these two charges and all other charges were dropped by the prosecution.He was originally charged with common assault, resisting arrest, larceny and being disorderly on licensed premises - but the last two charges were dropped.Moments after the incident, Cipriani was said to have told cops: “These wrists are gold, loosen the cuffs.Sam Morris, prosecuting, said he was in town with rugby teammates and trouble erupted when he tried to take his drinks outside.She told the court: The bouncer stopped him and Cipriani became verbally abusive. He pushed him and became physically abusive.The doorman then activated his body camera which angered him further. He then grabs him again and tries to pull the camera off his body.The bouncer contacted police officers nearby and said he wanted to make a formal complaint of assault.The court heard he then pushed the unnamed female officer in the chest area and was holding on to her collar and shirt.Ms Morris added: He was demanding to be let go and said get the f*** off me.He was eventually restrained but still struggled and was taken to the police station.The pin-up star was on a pub crawl with other players after his club staged an open training session with Jersey Reds RFC.He ended up in the nightclub attached to The Royal Yacht spa hotel which overlooks St Helier’s harbour.A source alleged: “The player was clearly sozzled and could be seen swaying around.“He could clearly be heard saying, ‘These wrists are gold, loosen the cuffs’. It caused a bit of a laugh.“When the police arrested him he was very relaxed.“St Helier is like a small village and nothing happens here without everyone knowing.“A few clubbers who watched the drama were die-hard England fans. Even as Cipriani was taken away, people were asking if it meant the end of his international career.”Gloucester Rugby Club today said Cipriani is very remorseful following the incident and fully accepts the outcome and his punishment.CEO Stephen Vaughn said: We are very proud of the culture we have within the group and the stated values which we strive to deliver against.Incidents of this nature are very disappointing to be associated with, and we will deal with it in a robust but balanced way but based purely on the facts.“As a high profile sportsperson there is often a large degree of public and media scrutiny involved, which Danny is well aware of.“The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved.“He knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club.However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support as we focus on the exciting season ahead.”He counts TV star Kirsty Gallacher and models Kelly Brook and Katie Price as his ex-lovers.Cipriani’s relationship with TV presenter Kirsty Gallacher ended in 2016 after six months as they struggled to cope with their 12-year age gap. A previous attempt to give things a go failed even sooner.Cipriani gave Kirsty the push after struggling to cope with her being a single mum of two young kids, Oscar and Jude, with her ex-hubby, rugby ace Paul Sampson.But Cipriani and the ex-Sky Sports host stayed in touch after their love affair - with rumours circling recently that they might reconcile.In 2016 Cipriani was convicted of drink-driving and banned for 18 months.Jersey Police told The Sun: “This afternoon, 30 year old Daniel Cipriani was charged with Common Assault, Larceny, Assault on Police, Resisting Arrest and Disorderly on Licenced Premises.“Cipriani was arrested in the early hours of this morning following an incident in Mulcaster St in St Helier.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000003387604.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"michael schumacher not moving majorca","story":"The family were forced to deny reports in Swiss news magazine L’Illustre that the racer would soon be transferred from his Swiss home to the sprawling £27million pad.Katia Rouarch, mayor of the district of Andratx, told the magazine: “I can officially confirm Michael Schumacher is going to move in to our municipality and that everything is being prepared to welcome him.”But the Schumachers have since confirmed this will not be the case.A spokeswoman for the family said: The Schumacher family does not plan to move to Majorca.It was reported last month that Shumachers wife Corinna had bought Real Madrid president Florentino Perez’s Majorcan mansion for nearly £27million.The huge property near Andratx features two swimming pools, a large garden, a helipad, a guest villa and stunning sea views.Aerial pictures show the propertys sprawling garden which features dozens of trees.Schumachers family has remained private about his life since the seven-time F1 champion suffered a catastrophic brain injury while skiing in December 2013.

That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart. An important story.Good people have left Labour as a consequence. The Jewish community in the UK is in uproar.Frightened of the far Left’s support for vile Islamists and its loathing of Israel and its right to exist.Scared of the morons who now lead Labour and its retinue of lefties who have said the most appalling, racist, stuff about Jews.Jeremy Corbyn, a genuine halfwit, thinks it is all “fake news”.He rolls his eyes when asked about it and gives different answers every time he is questioned.And guess who agrees with him? Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this?

Boris Johnson said back in 2016 that Britain will make a titanic success of Brexit.  But while the ex cabinet minister may have been using the word to mean big, he seems to have forgotten that for most of people Titanic refers to a ship which sunk in 1912 when it hit an ice berg.  It is also notable that the ship was believed to be unsinkable - and then it sank. You can draw your own conclusions as to how that might compare to Brexit.  The comic video, which uses scenes from the 1997 film starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, features David Cameron as captain of the sinking ship.    He is heard to say I do not think it would be right for me to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination, in reference to his resignation following the referendum, before the water bursts in and he disappears from view. Brexiteers Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and David Davis are seen in the ship\u0027s navigation room, while the spectre of Nigel Farage floats in the background.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn is seen as one of the violinists in the orchestra which famously kept on playing while the ship sank.   In the video created by Josh Pappenheim, Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson is also shown as a child who manages to get on a lifeboat to escape.     The pound is seen falling - as it did in the wake of the poll.  While the 42%/ 52% which was the result of the vote is projected on to the two halves of the ship.

Experts say communications between Tory whips should be released to the public. But the Cabinet Office has sparked fury by insisting the messages be kept secret. Government whips have frequently used messaging apps to coordinate Commons votes. The Mirror lodged an application for the messages sent through the chat - known as ‘WhipsApp’ - to coordinate Government business. But officials stunned transparency campaigners by claiming the messages are exempt from Freedom of Information laws because they are ‘political’ in nature. But the 17 Government whips are public office holders - effectively ministers. They pocket between \u0026pound25,000 and \u0026pound80,000 of taxpayers’ money on top of their MPs’ salary for doing the job.  FOI expert Matthew Burgess said: “Governments shouldn’t be avoiding transparency by hiding their work away from public view. Government business needs to be done in a clear way - there are exemptions in the FOI laws to allow policy discussions to be kept private - and that means making sure good records are kept.” “Technology shouldn’t be used as an excuse to circumvent openness.” Maintaining discipline in parliamentary votes has become vital to keeping Theresa May in office, since she lost her Commons majority in last year’s election. The Whips have reportedly used the WhipsApp group to maintain that organisation in a string of knife-edge votes, where the Prime Minister faced embarrassing defeats. And it is used to discuss so-called ‘pairing arrangements’, where MPs who cannot attend the Commons due to sickness or maternity leave.

Mr McCluskey, who is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , said the party had been insensitive in not adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition in full.  But the Unite general secretary, writing for HuffPost UK, prefaced his comments with a blistering attack on Jewish community leaders for what he called their intransigent hostility to Mr Corbyn. Mr McCluskey said the problem of anti-Semitism in the party was not manufactured but had certainly been wildly exaggerated. He said: I am at a loss to understand the motives of the leadership of the Jewish community - the Board of Deputies, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Jewish Labour Movement. They raised entirely proper concerns, but have simply refused to take \u0027yes\u0027 for an answer.  Mr McCluskey said the more Corbyn has personally sought to build bridges with the Jewish community, the worse the rhetoric has become. He added: What is the response from the leading Jewish community organisations to this record of reaching out, of understanding, and of action? Intransigent hostility and an utter refusal to engage in dialogue about building on what has been done and resolving outstanding difficulties.  I therefore appeal to the leadership of the Jewish community to abandon their truculent hostility, engage in dialogue and dial down the rhetoric, before the political estrangement between them and the Labour Party becomes entrenched.  Mr McCluskey, calling for the IHRA definition to be adopted, said: Clearly, it would have been far better for the party to have adopted at least ten of the eleven IHRA examples in their original wording. Not doing so - and particularly without adequate consultation - was insensitive and bound to lead to misunderstanding, and also served to distract attention from the real issues at stake. It would be for the best if all eleven were now agreed, so the party can move on.

The driver is under investigation after Lisa Jane Watson said he left her an official missed delivery note that had been scrawled on in blue biro: Pick up yer fone in future. The delivery driver added: Messed me about. You wasted half an hour cos of you. Lisa Jane Watson, from Warrington, Cheshire, was unable to take delivery of the package because her mother was in hospital with a broken hip. Lisa, 45, says she received 13 calls from an unknown London landline around the time of the delivery.  She answered on three occasions but the line was empty each time, meaning she ignored subsequent calls. The primary school teaching assistant says the disgusting note has made her scared to order online again and she has told her children not to answer the door. Lisa, an Amazon Prime customer, ordered Yankee candle plug-in refills on Monday and was told to expect delivery on Tuesday. She said: I had a couple of phone calls around lunchtime, which came up on my mobile as a London number. I ignored the first call but when they called back I answered it, the call then ended. They called again and I answered but again the call ended.  I then suspected it was a scam as it was a London number. I was then called numerous times but I declined each call. It was really frightening to receive so many calls like that. She added: I then arrived home at teatime to the note through the door and my parcel was left with a neighbour. As a single mum with two young girls. It\u0027s quite frightening that there is a driver out there that is that angry with me. I\u0027m scared to order anything again. When I saw the same neighbour he left it with getting a delivery, I was terrified that he [the driver] may come over to confront me. My safety chain is always on now and I\u0027ve told my girls not to answer the door. I got enough on my plate without all this added stress.

Still performing eight shows a week, even at 86 the idea of retirement sounds ridiculous to him. Brian believes he’ll carry on clowning until his final curtain. He says: “I joke to colleagues, ‘If I don’t come out of the box on stage just take it away and bury me’. “I feel alive on stage, so to take a final bow would not be such a bad way to go. I can’t stop working. It’s in my blood.” Brought up in Manchester with his grandma while his circus-performer parents Manz and Chico toured the world, Brian believes he was born to entertain. At 13 he did skits at a local zoo and loved it so much he left school a year early for a circus career.  “Something about the circus just drew me in,” he says. “When I was with my parents in the school holidays it would be natural to try juggling, rope throwing and things like discipline and work ethic. “Working as a clown’s assistant, hearing the audience react with laughter and applause was my reward and felt it was my natural home. I just felt like I belonged.” In a career spreading joy across the world, Brian won fans among Hollywood’s greatest stars, coached acrobatics to Great Britain athletes and, most proudly, performed with his \u0026shychildren Nicky and Sally.  For the past 20 years he has starred as the mischievous Brian Le Petit in Cirque Du Soleil’s show Mystere in Las Vegas. Recently he was honoured with a Las Vegas award for lifetime achievement, alongside Nicky. Brian says: “To be celebrated like this is astonishing as I never set out in my career to win awards, just entertain people. Working with the public keeps you fresh and on your feet. You never know what the audience will do – it makes it exciting and fun to go to work.  “I don’t think about my age really, it is just numbers. A lot of the Mystere troupe are around a third of my age. I find I feed off the energy of these whippersnappers. And I don’t think about stopping, What else am I going to do?” Brian has mastered far more than slapstick stunts and became known as one of the best tightrope walkers on the circus circuit. He says: “I was always athletic and sporty, so the wire was a starting point to expand on tricks. “For practice it was a couple of feet above ground, but I took one step out and then continued walking.  “I didn’t even think of coming off. It was just as normal as walking down the street. “Then I built into the act skipping, dancing and juggling while up there. I loved to get the laughs.” Brian also fell in love with singer Julie Dey and they married in 1959 and toured the world with their cabaret act. He says: “It was a great life. I’ll never forget the year in Africa, playing 200 shows, travelling by train. On the back car you could sit on the balcony, watching lions, giraffes and elephants in their habitat.  “Wherever we went we made friends and learned so much. Every day was an adventure and I had Julie to share the ride.” In 1965 Brian was flown to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show four weeks before The Beatles performed. He says: “It was a big show and an honour, but I saw it as well-paid gig. People today would see that as an opportunity to break into TV and movies, but I was settled in my career.  “Afterwards an agent offered me a season at Radio City Music Hall but I wanted to get back to London to be with my wife as we’d just had our daughter Sally. “It never entered my mind to grow a career and try for Hollywood. If I stayed who knows if movies would have called? “But I don’t regret anything. Family had always been important to me and I was not going to leave to build a career thousands of miles away.” Brian bought an 18-bedroom property in New Cross, South East London, to use as both a family home and rental spot.  He and his wife’s parents moved in to help care for Sally and younger son Nicky while he performed his tightrope act. Brian was a coach for several Great Britain members in the late 1970s but the circus drew him back in and he joined London’s Circus UK as assistant director. At the same time what was then a small French-Canadian company, Cirque du Soleil, which was doing similar shows, came calling.  He says: “The bosses saw what we did and asked us to go to Montreal for workshops. I didn’t realise that was their audition. “They loved my comic ringmaster so much that they hired me for that and to work the tightrope with Sally and Nicky. It reinvigorated me with a love for the circus as I was now well into my 50s.” Cirque created artistic coordinator roles for Brian at new shows in Las Vegas and Europe. But on the opening night of “O” in Vegas in 1998 Julie died of pancreatic cancer.

Mrs Jackson received a huge backlash after she was quoted saying Spanish people \u0027 should go somewhere else for their holidays \u0027 following her trip with a friend to Poseidon Playa through travel operator Thomas Cook. Her granddaughter, Lyndsey Jackson, 32, has accused people of bullying after thousands slammed her for saying her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. The retired care assistant told  from her hospital room where she\u0027s recovering from knee surgery: It\u0027s all a pack of lies. I never said the Spanish should go to another hotel, just that the hotel didn\u0027t cater to English people. It\u0027s been totally taken out of context.  Now people who don\u0027t even know me are calling me racist which is just not true. I didn\u0027t slag the Spanish off at all. I had asked for a hotel in Benidorm\u0027s new town, on the flat that was close to shops. But they gave me a hotel on a hill in the old town far from everything. Mrs Jackson, who worked as a carer and auxiliary nurse for most of her life, said the public backlash against her has been disgusting. She suffers from chronic arthritis and went into hospital on Monday for a knee replacement. But as she came out of theatre, in serious pain and confined to hospital, she was met with the news that story had hit the headlines.  Mrs Jackson had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Mrs Jackson and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Ahead of the trip the flights from Manchester to Allicante had been changed but she was not informed until she went to collect her tickets. Added to the that the hotel was not in the location she requested and she found it difficult to get around with her painful knee and mobility issues. She said she had never complained about a holiday before, but added that this one was a disaster from start to finish. She was quoted saying the \u0027hotel was full of rude Spanish holidaymakers\u0027 and that the entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish adding: Why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?

Developer Paul Mager said he didn\u0027t know the underground pipe was there until after the two-storey, detached house was already built. He decided to matters into my own hands and tear down the house in Tetney, Lincolnshire, amid a row with Anglian Water that he didn\u0027t think he would win. But it could only be the start of his trouble, as the local council says it received no prior approval for the demolition work, Grimsby Live reports.  Bulldozers moved in to demolish the executive house on Wednesday morning, sparking bemusement from neighbours. Mr Mager said the construction work could have ruptured the main, which serves homes across Cleethorpes and Waltham, leading to a major disaster. The head of Mager Homes Limited said: The detached house that is as we speak coming down has been built on the main water main from the Tetney Blow Wells. So that detached house has been built on the main water main artery that runs into Waltham and Cleethorpes. So to cut a long story short, having tried to do a deal with Anglian Water, it became apparent that the best thing to do was to take it down and re-site it.  It\u0027s a bit more complicated than that. But I have had a major row with Anglian Water and it looks like I was going to lose so I took matters into my own hands. Built on top of a main taking water from Tetney Blow Wells nature reserve, the house has never been occupied. It was approved in 2016 by East Lindsey District Council as part of an application for seven properties on Humberston Road. Mr Mager said: In order to avert that puncture taking place, the quickest thing was to take it down in order to avoid any damage to Anglian Water property. That little corner will be flattened and we will resubmit a planning application to redevelop in a different way.  I am not going into the argument with Anglian Water. But basically either the house had to move or the main had to move. For piece of mind, I decided to move the house on my own timetable. Mr Mager said the main only came to light after the house had been constructed. He said: I have been doing it all my life. If we had known it was there, we would never have done it. The ongoing demolition came as news to East Lindsey District Council\u0027s planning department, who said no prior permission had been given for the work. Development control service manager Chris Panton said: “This is the first we have heard of the demolition currently ongoing on Humberston Road, Tetney.

Mustafa Graf allegedly told those at the sermon “now it is time to act” and included prayers for “Mujahideen” - a term used for a group fighting armed jihad abroad. The BBC has obtained a recording of Graf’s address and the corporation understands Abedi bought at ticket for the Ariana Grande concert 10 days later. Abedi killed 22 and injured hundreds at the concert when he detonated a suicide bomb. One Muslim expert last night said Graf’s sermon was “brainwashing” young people. Abedi, aged 22, and his family regularly attended the mosque in Didsbury south Manchester and his father Ramadan sometimes led the call to prayer.  It is unknown whether Abedi – or any family members - attended the mosque on the day of the audio recording. The sermon by Mustafa Graf, which was delivered at the time of the bombing of Aleppo, included prayers for “Mujahideen” – a term used for a group fighting armed jihad abroad. “We ask Allah to grant them Mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory”, he says. Elsewhere Graf says, “Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation”. In another passage he says “now it is time to act and do something”.  The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations, with Graf at one point saying “the whole world, including Europe, America, what is the so-called civilised world” is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria. “They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. Well in fact they helped Iranian, Russian and others to kill Muslims over there.” BBC News played the audio for two Muslim scholars who said they both believe the language of the sermon represents a call for armed jihad.

More than 500,000 students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland received their A-level results today with more than one in four awarded top grades. It is the second year in a row that the A*-A pass rate has risen to 26.4%, but those getting the top A* fell slightly to one in 12 (8.0%) - the lowest since 2013. The overall A*-E pass rate has also fallen 0.3 percentage points to 97.6% - the lowest level since 2010 and put down to the switch in many courses to testing on final exams with coursework scrapped. The most popular subject was maths, taken by 97,627 students and 10,286 took computing - up by nearly a quarter from 8,299 last year.  For the second year running, boys have outperformed girls at the top grades. This year 26.6% of exam entries for boys were awarded an A or A*, compared with 26.2% of girls. And there has been a rise in the number of students taking Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects, which accounted for over a third of A-level entries. Michael Turner, president of JCQ, the body representing exam boards, said the overall picture shown by the results “is one of national stability during a period of significant reform.” "},{"url":null,"title":"night stalker obsessed burglar scrawled","story":"NewsNight Stalker-obsessed burglar scrawled satanic symbols on walls as he rifled through victims\u0027 underwear drawersConor Ashton, who nicknamed himself \u0027The Stalking Ransacker,\u0027 held terrified victims at knife point and lay their underwear out on beds during raids at homes across ColchesterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJames Hore14:57, 16 AUG 2018Updated15:12, 16 AUG 2018NewsConor Ashton nicknamed himself \u0027The Stalking Ransacker\u0027 (Image: SWNS- Cambridge)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA twisted burglar who admired infamous American serial killer the \u0027Night Stalker\u0027 has been jailed after carrying out a string of burglaries at women’s homes across Colchester. Conor Ashton, who nicknamed himself \u0027The Stalking Ransacker,\u0027 targeted single women and held them at knife point while rifling through their underwear drawers. Most of the time, the victims were not at home. But on the last two occasions before he was arrested, he broke into the homes of two women while they were asleep. The dangerous 23-year-old stood over the victims as they slept before using plastic cable ties to bind them while he ransacked their homes, stealing debit cards and phones. He helped himself to hot chocolate and wine as he rooted through their underwear drawers and then laid out garments on beds. A court heard how in a number of disturbing raids, Ashton tagged the houses of his victims with bizarre graffiti which included insults directed at police officers, and pentagrams.  He even left a running total of the number of burglaries he said he had carried out across a four-year period in the Essex town. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how Ashton was obsessed with Satanic killer Richard Ramirez who murdered at least 14 people in attacks that terrorised California in 1985. Cold-blooded killer Ramirez, who started out with burglaries, also left occult symbols at his crime scenes. Ashton was finally arrested by cops with an expert linking his handwriting to the graffiti left behind at homes he’d raided. The former farm worker admitted six counts of burglary and two charges of aggravated burglary. Dressed in a green tracksuit top, white shirt and blue jeans, he cried during his sentencing hearing.  As he was jailed today Judge Christopher Morgan branded him a dangerous offender who had targeted young single women. Stephen Rose, prosecuting, revealed shocking details of the crimes which began in 2013. Ashton burgled a series of university student properties close to his Colchester home but by last year the raids became shockingly violent. On July 10 last year a woman woke to find Ashton next to her bed ‘pointing a blade in her direction’. Mr Rose said: ‘He told the victim not to scream. “He was wearing a black balaclava, black top, black trousers and wearing black gloves and a black rucksack.” Twisted Ashton told the woman to hand over her debit card and pin number, warning her that her housemate was being held by another man.  “He told the victim he would not hurt her, instructed her to lie back before producing two plastic ties and tied her hands and ankles,” Mr Rose said. Ashton then left and his victim waited 20 minutes before calling out to her housemate who was fine and had not seen another person in the house. Ashton, whose family were sat in the packed courtroom, used the debit card to take \u0026pound500 out in three separate withdrawals. Just a month later, on August 14, he broke into a home and tied up another woman with cable ties. She ran shouting and screaming from her home into the arms of her shocked neighbours.  The woman told police she had woken up to the sight of a man at the end of her bed. Balaclava-clad Ashton told her he would not harm her and asked for money before tying her wrists. Mr Rose said Ashton told the woman ‘tell the pigs I had fun on Avon Way [the scene of his earlier raid]. “I already know my next target. It will be next week sometime.” Detectives investigating the case located a laptop stolen in a burglary which they traced back to Ashton. Police arrested Ashton the following month and during a search of his house they found a backpack containing gloves, a balaclava and zip ties.  Officers noticed how Aston had drawn pentagrams on his walls. His computer was seized and it revealed a search for ‘the original night stalker’ as well as for British Army forensics. Mr Rose added: “Part of the Crown’s case is the defendant appears, to some extent, to have modelled himself on a serial offender in America.” The court heard how Ashton had left graffiti in the houses appearing to taunt police. In one case he wrote: \u0027The Stalking Ransacker’, \u002735th burglary\u0027. \u0027Police Suck’, ‘Media Attention’. Ashton’s handwriting from a college application was matched by an expert to the graffiti. He denied involvement at first before later changing his pleas and admitting the string of raids. Richard Conley, mitigating, said the offences were completely out of character for Ashton, suggesting they had in some part been due to him using drugs.

Such was the bear\u0027s bulk, Press Association photographer Danny Lawson was also asked to put down his camera and help manoeuvre Victor into a comfortable position after he had been anaesthetised. A major operation was put in place after Victor and his smaller friend, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feet.  Staff suspected it was caused by an allergic reaction to pollen after moving from concrete bear pit enclosures elsewhere to the more natural setting at the attraction near Doncaster. Dermatologists from Liverpool University were brought in to carry out tests on Victor\u0027s skin, once he had safely been put under, to verify the theory. The results will be known in the coming days.  Animal manager Debbie Porter said: It has been a bonkers day. Victor was shaved and there are about 50 test sites on his side. Fingers crossed we can find out which allergies he has and we can set about making life more comfortable for him.

But she\u0027s not the first royal bride to have family troubles, and her late mother-in-law vowed never to speak to her mum again after a series of shocking conversations. Princess Diana\u0027s butler and close friend claims Frances Shand Kydd called her a whore and launched into a hate-filled personal attack on the men she was dating and their religious beliefs. During an interview with the Mirror several years ago, Paul Burrell revealed details of a particularly shocking conversation between the two women just months before Diana\u0027s death.  He revealed further details about their difficult relationship at Diana\u0027s inquest . The telephone conversation referred to Diana\u0027s relationships with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and businessman Gulu Lalvani. Mr Burrell said: I heard her call, Paul, come quick. She was hanging over the banister shouting down. She waved me over with her hand. I joined her on the floor cross-legged and stuck close beside her. I leant my ear as near to the phone as possible and listened to the conversation - albeit one-way. It was the slurring voice of Mrs Frances Shand Kydd. What I heard was a torrent of abuse, swearing and upsetting innuendo towards the Princess and towards the male company she was keeping.  It was a hate-filled personal attack on the men and their religious beliefs. The conversation ended when Diana slammed the phone, and Mr Burrell later found her sitting on the lounge floor crying. He claims Diana vowed never to speak to her mother again - and she never did. He said: How prophetic and sad those words were - because she didn\u0027t. It is something her mother will have to live with for the rest of her life. At Diana\u0027s inquest, Mr Burrell was asked to speak about the phone conversations she had asked him to listen into. However he was hesitant, replying simply: Respectfully that\u0027s not very kind to a lady who\u0027s no longer here.

But while some did as well as you may think, others achieved just a handful of qualifications - and one particularly high profile royal achieved none. Despite having what has been described as an aptitude for learning, The Queen didn\u0027t have time for formal schooling, having to instead learn the constitutional monarchy ropes from a young age. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and varying degrees of success to show for it.   So how do the royals qualifications measure up? Prince William From 1990, William attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire for five years until he started at Eton College in 1995 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He left Eton in 2000 achieving an A in Geography B Art and C Biology. Like many students, The Duke of Cambridge chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course in order to travel and gain a variety of new experiences. He went on to gain a 2:1 degree in Geography at St Andrews University in Scotland, which is where he met his wife, while they were students in residence at St Salvator\u0027s Hall.   The Duke of Cambridge initially began a four-year History of Art degree in 2001 but changed his major to Geography after two years.  The Duchess of Cambridge Kate achieved 11 GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne in 1995 and then went on to Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she achieved As in Maths and Art, and a B in English. Leaving Marlborough College in July 2000, The Duchess of Cambridge undertook a gap year in which she studied at the British Institute in Florence, undertook a Raleigh International programme in Chile, and crewed on Round the World Challenge boats in the Solent. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in 2005 with a 2:1 in History of Art  Prince Harry Probably one of the least academic achievers is Prince Harry, who studied at Eton, gaining 11 GCSE\u0027s and a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. On the royal\u0027s website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September 1998 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. On William\u0027s it outlines the three A Levels he took. Harry had plenty of successes though throughout his education and during his time at Eton, he was House Captain of Games and represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force.  He left in 2003 and joined the Army, but before doing so, he spent a year travelling to Australia, Argentina and Africa, where he made a documentary about the plight of orphans in Lesotho. The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in 1992 where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled.  She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesn\u0027t say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATs (which is the test students take as an entry into university) but it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 2003. During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years.  The Queen She\u0027s met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at 92 years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her life meaning she hasn\u0027t a single GCSE or A Level (O Levels back then) to her name. In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from 9.30am until 11am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in 1938, Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping . Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didn\u0027t harm her as she\u0027s naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower.    Prince Charles Prince Charles was educated at Gordonstoun where he achieved five O-levels (GCSEs) and two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French. He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a 2:2 degree in History Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princes Diana Princess Diana met with less success and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland.  Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics. While Prince Andrew attended Gordonstoun like his older brother, his academic choices were much like Anne\u0027s - six O-levels and A-levels in English, History and Politics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Prince Edward also went to Gordonstoun and has nine O-levels, three A-levels in English, History and Politics. He then gained a 2:2 degree in History from Cambridge University.

Dr Philippa Whitford said the growing likelihood of no deal left the Tories desperate for a trade pact with Donald Trump – at any cost.

Staff at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, US, desperately tried to keep Alyssa Gilderhus in the facility when her step-father came to help her \u0027escape\u0027. The Clinic have disputed the family\u0027s version of events in a statement provided to CNN.  However in a video Alyssa\u0027s step-father can be seen helping her out of a wheelchair and into the family car. Staff members come running toward him, yelling No! No!. One of them grabs the teenager\u0027s arm and her stepfather shouts Get your hands off my daughter!.  The car speeds away and soon Mayo security calls 911. We have had a patient abduction, the security officer tells police , according to a transcript of the call. CNN reports that Alyssa\u0027s leaving the hospital was not an abduction but an \u0027escape\u0027 because she and her family were unhappy with the care she was receiving. They had repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital but they say Mayo refused. The drama began just after Alyssa opened her first Christmas present at her home.  She went to the bathroom and her parents mum Amber Engebretson and stepfather Duane Engebretson heard her scream. The teenager was curled up on the bathroom floor and vomiting. At a nearby hospital, doctors determined she had a ruptured brain aneurysm and they drilled a hole into her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain. Later that day she was transferred to the world-renowned medical centre the Mayo Clinic, located 135 kilometres away. Doctors gave her a 2% chance of survival but after four brain surgeries in the next month Alyssa beat the odds and was transferred to a rehabilitation centre. This is when tensions between the family and the hospital began. On February 22 last year Alyssa\u0027s mum was kicked out of Mayo following a disagreement with staff and banned from stepping foot on the hospital property.  Despite repeated requests from both Alyssa and her mother to transfer her to a different hospital, Mayo refused to let her leave. In a Facebook post, Amber wrote that her daughter was “basically a prisoner of Mayo”. CNN reports that Alyssa was examined by a psychiatrist who found she “lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions”.  Five days after her mother was banned, staff at Mayo discovered Alyssa had been recording a video for her mum and took away her phone, laptop and tablet. They then refused to let visitors bring similar devices into her room. Her stepfather had an idea to help Alyssa \u0027escape\u0027. They pretended an elderly relative was visiting to see the teenager but was unableto get to her room so Alyssa would have to come down and see her. With his nine-year-old daughter secretly filming, Duane wheeled Alyssa down to the hospital car park. The video showed Amber in the driver’s seat. Alyssa, we’re going to go home honey,” she said to her daughter. Once in the car, Duane yelled at his wife to drive: “Get out of here Amber. Go, go, go, go, go, go!”.

There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work. The guys just need to slow down, the most important thing they need to do is make the keeper make a save.”As for the goal that won the game, Neil conceded after initial doubts he agreed Bobby Madden’s call to award a penalty against Genseric Kusunga for handling a Niall McGinn corner was correct.“Just to address the penalty, I’ve seen it, it’s a penalty,” he added.“At the time I wasn’t sure. I went to Bobby to get his opinion on it at the end of the game and regardless of how close Gensi is, he felt it was a penalty. I’ve seen it now and I agree, his hand’s up there.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/SNS-15302518-DUFC-V-ST-J.jpg-503x564.jpg ","title":"dundee colts and united drawn at home in irn bru cup","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee Colts and Dundee United have been awarded home ties in the Irn Bru Cup.The second round draw has seen the Dark Blues youngsters host Motherwell Colts.Meanwhile United will welcome Alloa Athletic to Tannadice.

We knew it would be a good game, we know what Hibs are about, they are a very good team.“I enjoyed the way we played, some of the stuff in the first half was excellent but we know they have quality and put us under pressure.

I just didn’t get my game-time.“When I did play at Dundee, I think I did well, but I thank Neil McCann for giving me the chance to come out to Dunfermline on loan.“The system we played at Dundee didn’t help me.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Sam-Jones-in-the-crowd-for-Dundee-v-Aberdeen.jpg.jpg ","title":"rejected sam jones turns down dundee after talks with neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann has been hit with a blow in his bid to sign a goalscorer after he was turned down by Sam Jones.Dundee and Shrewsbury Town had agreed a five-figure fee and the 26-year-old saw was a Dens Park spectator in the directors\u0026#8217 box on Saturday as McCann\u0026#8217s men went down 1-0 to Aberdeen.But after considering a switch to the SPFL, he has now returned to the Shrews and trained with John Askey’s squad today.Although born in Barnsley, he has represented Wales youth at youth level.Jones only joined the Shrews in January after spells at National League outfit Gateshead and League Two Grimsby Town that saw him among the goals on a regular basis.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b753f8157591.jpg ","title":"revealed menu for va dundee offers haggis gnocchi arbroath smokie tart and other local dishes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMushroom tacos, Arbroath smokie tart, buffalo steak and popcorn shrimp are just some of the delights awaiting diners when Dundee’s V\u0026ampA museum opens next month.The Tatha Bar and Kitchen, located upstairs in the new museum with a balcony overlooking the River Tay, has released its menu ahead of the grand opening on September 15.And diners can expect a true taste of Tayside, with brewers, fishmongers and farmers from Dundee and Perth all being brought on board as suppliers.Dundee brewery 71 Brewing will be providing two main beers – Mandarina Sky and 71 Lager.Duncan Alexander, managing director of 71 Brewing, said it was a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to be enlisted as a beer supplier.He said: “The V\u0026ampA called our catering company eight months ago.

inaction","story":"\u0026nbspFED-UP community leaders say they can no longer tolerate the lack of action over the fire-ravaged Eastgate Hostel building in Inverness city centre.Members of Crown and City Centre Community Council fear the wrangle over the building \u0026ndash which went up in flames in 2013 \u0026ndash will be a repeat of the impasse at the nearby B-listed Viewhill House which remains a prominent blot on the city\u0027 landscape since fire also struck there 11 years ago.They are calling on Highland Council either to approve redevelopment plans for the former hostel in Stephens Brae, or to acquire the eyesore building.Community council leader Pat Hayden said lessons had to be learned from the case of Viewhill House in Old Edinburgh Road.Once the home of renowned 19th century engineer Joseph Mitchell and later a youth hostel, it has remained derelict since the fire amid a legal wrangle between the present and former owners and a lack of funding for renovations.\"The former youth hostel at Viewhill is in our Crown area and is truly a blight on the landscape,\" Mrs Hayden said.\"We cannot allow Eastgate Hostel to follow suit, particularly as it is situated in such a prime city centre location.\"Members of the community council can no longer tolerate the lack of action regarding Eastgate Hostel.\"An application was lodged by the owners earlier this year to remove the scaffolding from the building and demolish the remaining structure ahead of construction.But it still has to be determined after a council officer and Historic Environment Scotland voiced disquiet about proposals to rebuild the facade at a lower height.In its submission to council planners, the community council states: \"We urge the council to make every effort to resolve this situation, either by granting permission which might allow the applicants to proceed or alternatively, failing that, acquiring the building, presumably at a basic land value given its condition.\"James Maxwell, chairman of Inverness Civic Trust, said his organisation is also keen to see progress at the site,\"Our basic position was that we wanted to see the whole of the frontage of the Eastgate building restored to the original design,\" he said.\"But if finances prevented that, as a compromise we did not object to salvaging part of it, provided architectural connectivity between the ground and first floor was preserved.\"Meanwhile chiropodist James Crawford, whose practice is close to the site, was contacted by Inverness city manager David Haas after his calls for a public meeting on the building\u0027 future were reported in the Inverness Courier.Mr Crawford has declined the offer of a private meeting with Mr Haas and the owners\u0026rsquo agent.\"It has gone beyond that \u0026ndash there should be a public meeting,\" he said.\"It is ridiculous that the unresolved issues at Eastgate and Viewhill have gone on for this long.\"Mr Haas said any interested parties could contact him and the main focus was currently to get the scaffolding down.\"There is great pressure on the owners to come up with a scheme to do that,\" he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokesman for the building\u0027 owners said: \"We are working very closely with Highland Council to move this forward as quickly as possible. Circumstances are changing to allow us to move a lot quicker.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117069.jpg","title":"Co op opens new distribution centre at Dalcross","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound6 million distribution centre that will help the Co-op expand its presence across the north has officially opened for business.The 12,000 sq ft Dalcross Distribution Centre at Inverness Airport Business Park (IABP) will service the Co-op\u0027 network of stores in the region.It will also help service the convenience store operator\u0027 ongoing \u0026pound28 million expansion and renovation plans.These will see 18 new Co-op store open across Scotland by the end of the year, with a further 20 upgraded to take the total number of stores to 365 and the number of Co-op employees to almost 6000.The new Dalcross facility currently employs 50 staff.Andy Perry, logistics director of the Co-op, said: \"We\u0026rsquore thrilled to be able to launch our new site at Dalcross \u0026ndash it\u0027 a modern and future-proofed facility which is perfectly placed to support the Co-op\u0027 ever-growing operations in Scotland.

There is no point in building cycle paths in the countryside if the busy streets of the city are a barrier to accessing them.\"Growth in the sector would bring widespread benefits, he added.\"A typical touring cyclist may spend \u0026pound20 hiring a bike, but will spend several times that on accommodation, food and visitor attractions.\"But cycling infrastructure needs a fair share of the transport budget and public services across the board need to be funded better.\"Highland Cycle Campaign convener Brian MacKenzie commented: \"People have become too dependent on cars.

But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t. I was surprised.“I also disagreed with what the council said. They made out there were a lot of insects in the kitchen where we make food, but it was two insects in a back room.“They would have come in during a food delivery and it was an isolated incident – one we sorted out right away.”Mr Duncan said he was delighted to have passed the latest inspection and was looking forward to getting things back on track.“It was a bit of a setback, but we’re pleased it’s behind us now.“Our food tastes great and we have a wide range of dishes for people to sample.“I have a great team of staff and we love our customers calling in.“I hope that more people will come in over the coming days and weeks to see what we have to offer.”Mr Duncan added: “I am proud to run the business and always welcome customer feedback.“We pride ourselves on offering delicious food people want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"baby boxes first birthday","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlmost 6,000 baby boxes have been received by new parents in the north-east.As the Baby Box initiative celebrates its first birthday this week, new figures have shown that 5,932 families across the NHS Grampian area have had boxes delivered to them in the past year.The number of boxes received in the area ranks third in the country, behind NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian.What do you get inside Scotland\u0026#8217s baby box?A Scottish Government scheme, it includes a number of essential items for parents and babies, while the box itself can be used as a safe sleeping place.Children and early years minister Maree Todd said: “A year on from when the first Baby Boxes were delivered, we can say these boxes are having a real impact on the lives of those who receive them.“These boxes demonstrate that, as a society, we value each and every child in Scotland.

We have an extremely talented local artist community, a perfect example being Kelly-Ann Cairns, who has done a beautiful job marking the 50th anniversary of the Aberdeen Cyrenians.“Aberdeen Inspired, working with Mary Butterworth, our fantastic local curator, has allowed this first art project of its kind in Scotland to provide the opportunity for service users to explore painting techniques through workshops and help build their confidence. What more could you ask for?”He added: “We are naturally very proud of everything Painted Doors has achieved and continues to do so.“It is no surprise at all to see it being replicated in other towns and cities across the country.”Ms Butterworth said: “This year, as well as continuing to showcase Aberdeen’s creative scene, I wanted to touch on the wider community – raising awareness and the benefits of creativity and expression towards personal wellbeing.“Working with Kelly and the amazing women and team from Cyrenians has been such a pleasure.“They have done an fantastic job in creating a beautiful and powerful piece.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"report could open way for trail to pedal ahead","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new north-east bike trail has been recommended for approval, providing it meets environmental conditions.The 20km tracks planned for just outside Tarland would also feature a car park.The tracks would be built on the southern side of the hill of Pressendye.Circuits would be graded along difficulty lines – with blue being the easiest, followed by orange and red, which is described as “extreme and jump tracks” in the report.A report is due to go before the Marr Area Committee at its next meeting on Tuesday.In the report, council officers said: “There is significant support for developments which promote and encourage outdoor access, leisure and recreation, particularly where this can have a positive effect on the local economy and encourage tourism.”Along with the recommendation to approve the plans, the report says that 12 conditions should be imposed on the development.These include a site protection plan for the blue trail, to ensure that the historical surroundings are not harmed, as well as no external lighting being erected to ensure the welfare of protected animals in the area.The application received 91 representations, with 22 objections.Cromar Community Council was one of the parties to object to the plans.The community council contended that the construction of the trail, in addition to the existing one on the south west of the village, could “sandwich” Tarland between the trails and create a hub for mountain bikers.The group also argues that the development would have an impact on the ecology of the area.Both the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) had no objections to the plans, with SNH saying the proposal would not have any effect on local species.However SEPA did say it would prefer the tracks to be moved slightly north.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 30","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/07/18, 3:43 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.It was a case of \u0026#8216all\u0026#8217s well that ends well\u0026#8217 for young Adam in the Furnace hills last week.Police officers and his mum left him in no doubt of how narrow an escape he had.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income.

If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust. In the first instance this will involve running a number of football-related activities at Ardrishaig Gala Day.Hamish Nicol, chairman of the Ardrishaig Community Trust said: ‘In the official year of young people we are a delighted to support an organisation who match our ambitions to create a better tomorrow for our young people.‘The trust has been very active behind the scenes over the last few years and this three year programme of support allows us to raise our profile.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village. I don’t know what they’re trying to do to small places.\u0026#8217 Flora Shaw, Earra Gael gift shop.\u0026#8216It’s terrible, because we get people coming in here asking us for information.

It\u0026#8217s mad even if it was just simply for the limited hours in October but we definitely need something in the summer months.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m not happy about it. They are a mine of information and when it closes I don’t know what we\u0026#8217ll do because our internet signal is so sketchy around here.\u0026#8217 Christine Entwistle, Harbour Gallery.\u0026#8216I think it’s a great pity.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

in sea lice control","story":"Marine Harvest Scotland and Scottish Sea Farms have been working with the Institute of Aquaculture at the University of Stirling to produce farm-reared ‘cleaner fish’, so-called because they eat naturally occurring external parasites such as sea lice from salmon.The aim was to rear the cleaner fish in the most responsible, sustainable and environmentally-friendly way.In six years, the project team has bred wild-caught Ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and raised the offspring from egg to adults of reproductive age.In what is believed to be a world first, those same offspring have produced their own eggs, which have successfully hatched, completing the lifecycle of farming wrasse in a controlled environment.The team has also gone on to successfully wean the wrasse larvae and fry from live food to a dry diet – another key milestone and one that will give salmon farmers more control over the health and nutrition of farmed wrasse.It is the sector’s ambition to become self-sustaining and use only farmed stocks of cleaner fish – a goal that is now within grasp thanks to these latest advances.Says Marine Harvest Scotland’s hatchery manager, Paul Featherstone: \u0026#8216Ballan wrasse provides highly effective, highly natural sea lice control and as such is in huge demand.\u0026#8216With this breakthrough, we now have proven procedures for breeding, weaning and rearing wrasse.\u0026#8217Adds Scottish Sea Farms’ head of fish health, Ralph Bickerdike: \u0026#8216These landmark breakthroughs are the result of many years of collaborative research.\u0026#8217The two leading salmon farmers entered into the multi-million pound collaboration in 2011.Under the terms of the collaboration, all insights gleaned will be shared with the wider

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

National 5 pass rates at an A-C grade fell from 78.5 per cent to 75.4 per cent however, the local authority said that this was affected by the removal of monthly assessments which made up a percentage of the final mark.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8207400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated.

Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

Mr Ross, who suffers from eye condition Stargardt disease, was working in the company\u0026rsquos Aberdeenshire brewery when he told bosses his eyesight had deteriorated and he was awaiting tests.

The tribunal heard that Mr Ross told the firm about his sight problems when he first started working for them in July 2016.  However, in January 2017 he told his manager that his vision was deteriorating.  He later provided Brewdog with a copy of a medical report stating that further tests were needed which would likely result in him being declared blind.  The company\u0026rsquos Health and Safety manager, John Fairclough, was asked to complete a risk assessment on Mr Ross and he was given a high risk rating.  An occupational health report was also ordered, which found that Mr Ross was not fit for work, but the tribunal found that this was not carried out by a medic with any expertise in visual impairment.  RNIB employment adviser Ruth Morrell then visited the brewery and recommended a number of changes that could allow him to keep working.  Mobility Officer Jeff Bligdon also visited the site and found that Mr Ross was still able to carry out his work without any difficulty.  In his report, Mr Bligdon stated: \u0026ldquoI felt that if [Brewdog] could end James\u0026rsquo employment with them, they would have done it there and then.  \u0026ldquoThe health and safety person was particularly negative towards James and came across as not wanting to adapt or try anything that would assist James.

Paigham Mustafa  The father of three, said that many Muslims were being taught \"cultural\" lessons which strayed from the true meaning of Islam.  He believes the community has allowed itself to become isolated and backwards-looking, and has called on his fellow Muslims to be more open to Western values.  Mr Mustafa who spent several years writing his book \u0027The Quran: God\u0026rsquos Message to Mankind\u0027, said: \u0026ldquoIt is high time that British Muslims become pro-active instead of reactive.

Under the plans, 16 and 17-year-olds would also be allowed to remain in licensed premises until 11pm, which could benefit teenagers attending gigs in the city centre and eating out with family.  Speaking about the plan, chairman of Glasgow Licensing Board Cllr Matt Kerr said: \u0026ldquoBy potentially granting licences until 4am while demanding the highest possible standards from licence holders we are striking the right balance between the licence trade and the needs of the wider community.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a strong view that a more European approach would avoid the rush to consume alcohol before closing time that then spills out on to our city centre streets.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very important to stress that this is still a proposal and that in any event, 4am closing would still be the subject a pilot programme that will draw in evidence from the likes of the police and the health service.  Club owners insist current drinking hours are \u0026ldquorestrictive and, according to Garage boss Donald Macleod, Glasgow should be free to compete with other European cities.  \u0026ldquoI think this approach is very progressive,\" said Mr Macleod, who is also convenor of Glasgow Licensing Forum. \"It\u0026rsquos about getting a balance, to keep the city open for those who demonstrate the standards.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos the point of having platinum status for Best Bar None if you aren\u0026rsquot rewarded for it.  Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the city\u0027s night time economy \u0026ndash which already generates \u0026pound2.6 billion per year and supports some 16,600 jobs \u0026ndash would enjoy a shot in the arm if the plan is green lit.  \u0026ldquoOperating in a similar way to our European counterparts by adding an hour extra to opening times of pubs, bars and clubs across the city opens avenues for increased success within the industry,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoWe are fully in support of any developments that reiterates the overall aims of Glasgow\u0026rsquos economic strategy and we will work closely with our members within the sector to optimise the proposed new license within the city.  Under the plans, which have been put out for consultation, venues would be considered for the later hours if the licence holder can prove they have prioritised public safety, securing gold status or above in the Best Bar None scheme.  Paul Waterson, of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association said later opening hours was \"not the way to go\".  \u0026ldquoThere used to be three separate licenses, there was one for restaurants, one for pubs and one for clubs,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoUnder the new act there was just one licence and the differentials have been eroded.

Wracked with dysentery and in the company of a wounded Australian photographer colleague whose radial nerve had been severed by shrapnel, we had lain on the floor of a battered bus crammed with dead and wounded Afghan guerrilla fighters for five days as it crawled across desert plains and hills towards the Pakistan frontier.  It was only near Ghazni that to our great relief, we at last managed to give our Russian pursuers the slip before making it out of Afghanistan.  Ghazni\u0026rsquos strategic position has always been important in Afghanistan\u0026rsquos seemingly interminable wars. Its proximity to Kabul and location on the major highway connecting the capital to the south makes it a vital lifeline.  It\u0026rsquos for precisely this reason that over the past week, this city of some 280,000 people has found itself at the centre of a fierce battle as Taliban insurgents sought to capture it.  It was last Friday when more than 1,000 Taliban fighters stormed the city in a predawn assault. Reports indicate that a number of foreign fighters aided the Taliban in their offensive, among them Pakistani and Chechen jihadists and even some al-Qaeda affiliates.  For a while it was touch and go with the Taliban gaining control of much of Ghazni before Afghan Army troops backed by US forces retook the embattled city on Tuesday. This though is far from being an isolated incident.  No sooner had the security forces reasserted their control over Ghazni, than the Taliban in the past few days have again attacked and seized large parts of an army base in the northern province of Faryab, killing at least 10 soldiers and capturing dozens of others.  The latest violence not only raises questions over much mooted peace talks with the Taliban but also casts a shadow over Afghanistan\u0026rsquos upcoming parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20.  It\u0026rsquos against this volatile backdrop too that Britain this week deployed another four hundred and forty troops, effectively almost doubling its \u0026lsquoboots on the ground\u0026rsquo to a total of 1,090 military personnel.  It\u0026rsquos now four years since British troops \u0026lsquodeparted\u0026rsquo from Afghanistan. During those 13 years of fighting hundreds of British lives were lost while some \u0026pound40bn was spent trying to tame the Taliban.  During my time embedded as a correspondent within both British and American units, I watched as the consummate professionalism of those troops on the ground was slowly eroded by the stark realisation that this was a war that was unwinnable.  The new plan now the politicians duly told us was that Nato would formally end its retaliation for Afghanistan harbouring Osama bin Laden. It would withdraw its forces and leave the Afghan government and its military along with continued \u0026lsquoadvisory\u0026rsquo support to deal with the Taliban itself. Cue the UK\u0026rsquos latest troop deployment which we are told, will involve little more than ferrying international advisors safely around the country\u0027s capital city, Kabul, in their Foxhound vehicles hence giving rise to them being dubbed \u0026ldquoArmoured Uber.  But all these \u0026lsquojolly japes\u0026rsquo aside, the reality remains that the Taliban is in the ascendancy, and any support role undertaken by UK troops still puts them in harms way. That we have all been here before and seemingly learned nothing beggars belief. As does the fact that the UK government\u0026rsquos agreement to deploy more troops is almost certainly done to assuage US President Donald Trump after his Nato visit last month.  Mr Trump, a president who promised to bring US troops home from foreign campaigns is now faced with the harsh reality of a re-galvanised Taliban, and is making sure his UK and Nato allies are not let of the hook when it comes to sharing the burden in the fight against them.  Not that all of this really matters in the military scheme of things, given that the Taliban is now said to be in control of 70 per cent of the country.  Yes, that\u0026rsquos the stark reality of where Afghanistan stands right now. Seventeen years on since a US and UK deployment that has cost tens of thousands of Afghan lives, thousands of American and British lives combined and swallowed up billions of dollars, we are right back where we started.  Only last month the New York Times highlighted how the newest US military strategy in Afghanistan \u0026ldquomirrors past plans for retreat. In other words it calls for American-backed Afghan troops to pull back from partially populated areas of the country.  This of course will ensure that the Taliban and other Islamist groups will effectively hold on to territory that they have already seized, leaving the government in Kabul to safeguard the capital and major cities such as Kandahar, Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif and Jalalabad. At least that\u0026rsquos how the thinking went until the Taliban this past week threw a spanner in the works with its assault on Ghazni.  What is this \u0026lsquoretreat to the city\u0026rsquo if not searing confirmation that the American installed government in Afghanistan remains unable to lead and protect the country\u0026rsquos sprawling rural population? Barely over one-quarter of Afghanistan\u0026rsquos population lives in urban areas.  If there\u0026rsquos a sense of deja vu about all of this, then it\u0026rsquos because those thirty or so years ago when I travelled with the Afghan guerrillas back in the 80\u0026rsquos, the Soviets then too in their own war had abandoned rural areas allowing opposition fighters to control most of the country.  We should have learned from the Russians own decade long experience then, but we didn\u0026rsquot. We should have learned too from our own more recent military campaign in the country, but it appears that we haven\u0026rsquot.  Unpalatable as it might be, the inescapable fact is that any chance of a political solution in Afghanistan right now is just as remote as a military one. Once again slowly but surely we are being drawn back into the Afghanistan quagmire, and it\u0026rsquos only a matter of time before it costs us dearly."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-may-my-quest-to-raise-profile-of-scottish-innovator-in-3d-photography","story":"  But while Queen\u0027s electric brand of arena-thrilling hits has stirred the souls of millions, the passions of the former PhD Astronomy student have turned out to be a little more niche.  Famously, he has been an unlikely champion of badgers and previously railed against the attempted cull of hedgehogs on Uist.  But (Dr) Brian May\u0027s current obsession germinates from a childhood devotion to collectable 3D cards handed out free in the 1950s inside boxes of Weetabix.  Now the Hall of Fame rock star is shining the spotlight on an almost forgotten photographic innovator who brought images of the Scottish landscape to life.  George Washington Wilson, based in Aberdeen, was appointed Photographer to the Queen in 1873 and is considered one of the greatest \u0027lensmen\u0027 of his generation.  Records of about his skill producing 3D images have now largely faded from history, but Wilson (1823 to 1893) is a personal hero to Brian May, who now owns one of the largest collections in the world of Victorian stereo photographs.  Brian May spoke to The Herald as he appeared at the Edinburgh International Book Festival discussing a \u0027labour of love\u0027 book about George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor (who coincidentally shares the same name as the Queen drummer), for which May provided the introduction.  \"This is one of the reasons we got into this, is to try and put [George Washington Wilson] back in his place, where he should be,\" he said.  And May told an audience in the Main Theatre of the festival, at a sold out event,\u0026nbspthat his zeal for stereoscopic pictures sparked a curiosity to have a go himself, taking unique images of his family and bandmates.  One particularly intimate picture of Freddie Mercury, he finds particularly moving.  He said: \u0026ldquoMy favourite is one I had no knowledge of, which I did not remember, was one of Freddie backstage putting on make up.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very intimate and very personal, it\u0026rsquos one the paparazzi would never get because he\u0026rsquod be so conscious of them.  \"But I was always there.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos something so precious to me, it\u0026rsquos not only candid and personal, but it is 3D as well, so it feels like you could walk into it and touch Freddie.  \u0026ldquoTo be honest, my team nursed me through it, because some of it was quite difficult for me, it can be a little bit too personal.  The latest George Washington Wilson book, published by May\u0027s London Stereoscopic Company (LSC) firm, follows a previous major work by Prof Taylor from1981 which fell out of print.  Speaking yesterday, Professor Taylor said: \"One of the reasons Wilson fell out of favour was because he was so prolific, he was everywhere and people couldn\u0027t make any sense of it.  \"But his real contribution to me is his 3D work, his stereoscopic work.\"  He added: \"I really hope this book will help put him back up there, because he really was important.  \"He was dismissed because he was commercial, but that reach and popularity and entrepreneurialism is something we celebrate.\"  George Washington Wilson, by Prof Roger Taylor, was published on 15 August"},{"url":null,"title":"yes-demo-at-snp-conference-to-urge-action-on-second-independence-referendum","story":"  In a further sign of division in the independence movement, scores of people are planning to demonstrate at the SNP conference in October to push for another vote.  They will urge the First Minister to \u0026ldquouse the mandate she sought and which, by her own benchmark, she secured at the general election for a new vote on the constitution.  Ms Sturgeon said last year that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster it would convert her already \u0026ldquocast-iron mandate for a referendum into a \u0026ldquotriple lock one.  The other parts of the triple lock were the SNP win in the 2016 Holyrood election and a vote by a majority of MSPs for the transfer of referendum powers in March 2017.  However the First Minister \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, and is due to update Holyrood on her new timetable in October.  Senior SNP figures such as MP Pete Wishart and MSP Alex Neil have urged caution, downplaying the prospect of another plebiscite in the near future.  Many in the Yes movement are frustrated at the lack of momentum on a new referendum and want Ms Sturgeon to use the mandate before it expires at the 2021 Holyrood election.  So far 70 people have said they will attend the \u0026lsquoUse The Mandate\u0026rsquo event at the SEC Centre in Glasgow, and 210 more have said they are interested.  The event is being organised by the Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba group, which has also helped organise recent marches calling for a second referendum.  Scottish Tory chief whip Maurice Golden said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos famous discipline is beginning to wilt, and it looks set to do so in spectacular style with a demo outside its own conference.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon has marched her independence diehards to the top of the hill and now they\u0026rsquore furious about being left in limbo.  \u0026ldquoShe should do what\u0026rsquos in Scotland\u0026rsquos best interests \u0026ndash march them back down and take another referendum off the table altogether.  Scottish LibDem MSP Tavish Scott added: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos public services face a heap of imminent challenges. Surely there are better things the SNP could be doing to boost the country than standing outside a pro-independence conference bemoaning the fact it\u0026rsquos not pro-independence enough.  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister has made clear, she will provide an update this autumn. Given the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic mishandling of things, the terms of Brexit are currently far from clear \u0026ndash but it is positive to see people from across the country continue to campaign passionately for independence.  Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"pressure-on-nicola-sturgeon-as-snp-voters-demand-say-on-brexit-deal","story":"  The largest poll of Scottish voters since the EU referendum found 65 per cent of those who backed the SNP last year want a public vote on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.  Two-thirds of those who voted SNP at the general election also want Ms Sturgeon to campaign for a public vote, something she has so far refused to do.  Most Scottish LibDem and Labour voters also want a public vote, but are less enthusiastic (62 and 56 per cent respectively), while 63 per cent of Scottish Tory voters oppose one.  Overall, 48 per cent of Scots want a public vote, 31 per cent are opposed and 22 per cent don\u0026rsquot know, compared to 45, 34 and 22 per cent respectively for the UK as a whole.  The YouGov poll of 2000 Scottish adults also showed Scotland is now keener about staying in the European Union than ever, with 66 per cent of decided voters backing Remain and 34 backing Leave, compared to the 62-38 split two years ago.  SNP voters are the strongest Remain supporters, backing it 83-17, suggesting a recent swing against Brexit among many Nationalists, a third of whom voted Leave.  In the UK as a whole, sentiment has also shifted in favour of Remain, but only just.  Just 12 per cent of Scots expect the UK to get a \u0026ldquogood deal from the Brexit negotiations, in which Theresa May is pushing her soft Brexit Chequers plan, and 68 per cent a poor one.  The poll was commissioned by the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign which is holding a rally in Edinburgh this Saturday in support of a public vote on the final outcome of the Brexit talks.  The survey found a remarkable 86 per cent of Scots (95 per cent of SNP voters), regarded the process of leaving the EU so far as \u0026ldquoa mess.  It also found 65 per cent of Scots felt the UK government was ignoring Scotland\u0026rsquos concerns on Brexit, 70 per cent did not trust Westminster on Brexit, and 80 per cent, including most Leavers thought the promises of Brexiter politicians would be broken.  Most SNP, LibDem and Labour voters said Brexit would weaken the economy, cost jobs, lower living standards, hurt the NHS, raise taxes and make today\u0026rsquos children worse off.  Most Scottish Tory voters said Brexit would improve the same things or have no impact.  Asked if Brexit would make Scottish independence more likely, 43 per cent said yes, 6 per cent said less likely, and 35 per cent said it would make no difference.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign said the findings would \u0026ldquopile pressure on the SNP and Labour leaderships to support a vote on the Brexit outcome.  Former YouGov president Peter Kellner said: \u0026ldquoSupport for a public vote on the outcome is growing across the UK but is particularly strong in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThere is deep pessimism about what Brexit will mean for Scotland and the next generation.  \u0026ldquoThe survey suggests the leaderships of both the SNP and the Labour Party are in the wrong place with most of their supporters.  \u0026ldquoThere may be an electoral dividend in Scotland for one of these parties if they strengthen their position. For instance, by a margin of three to one Labour supporters want Jeremy Corbyn to campaign for a public vote while Nicola Sturgeon may yet want to move faster than she has in backing such a route on Brexit.  The First Minister has said the SNP will not be a block to a vote on the Brexit deal, and said such a vote may be \u0026ldquoirresistible, but has never endorsed it.  Many Nationalists fear that if the SNP backed a second EU vote it would set a precedent that would be used against them in the event of a Yes to independence.  Former SNP minister Alex Neil, who backed Brexit, said: \u0026ldquoIf we supported a second Brexit referendum, when we win Indyref2, the Unionists would demand an Indyref3 to overturn it.  A separate poll for the Left Foot Forward website yesterday found most voters in the UK would blame Theresa May for a no-deal Brexit rather than the EU.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie warned Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard were \u0026ldquoout of step with the country.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe benefits of remaining in the EU are irreplaceable and the people can see quite clearly that whatever deal the Conservatives patch together will not be as good as the one we have now. But even as the Conservatives bumble towards a cliff edge, Scottish Labour and the SNP are still refusing to swing into action.  \"Every day that passes Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Leonard are looking more out of step with the people of Scotland. They need to end the ifs and buts and listen to the huge majority of Scots calling for a final say.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoIt is a democratic outrage that Scotland is being forced out of the EU against our will. People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and the SNP continues to believe this is the best option for Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  We will not be a block on a second EU referendum but the views of the people of Scotland must not be ignored all over again if there is to be another vote.  \"The Tories now think they can do anything they want to Scotland and get away with it. Their extreme Brexit is threatening jobs, livelihoods and the interests of ordinary people, as well as the powers of the Scottish Parliament.  Former Labour PM Gordon Brown yesterday told the Edinburgh Book Festival more than 1m Labour Leave voters across the UK had turned against Brexit.  A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoA second referendum is not Labour policy and wasn\u0026rsquot in our manifesto. Labour has always insisted that Parliament has a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"holy-grail-of-whisky-to-be-auctioned-for-up-to-900000","story":"  The 1926 Macallan Valerio Adami is due to be auctioned at Bonhams Whisky Sale in Edinburgh in October with an estimation of between \u0026pound700,000 and \u0026pound900,000.

A: Clearing is the annual process that allows students without a university place, or who want to switch to a different one, to search for and find a degree course with availability.  You can use Clearing if you are applying for the first time after June 30, if you did not receive any offers from any universities, or none you wanted to accept, or if you did not meet the required grades needed for your chosen university course.  Q: When does Clearing open and how long does it last?  A: Clearing opened on July 5 and closes on October 23.  Q: How do I apply for a university place through Clearing?  A: If you haven\u0026rsquot already applied for a university place through the main application scheme, you need to submit an application to Ucas. You will then be sent an email and have access to Ucas\u0026rsquos online system, Track. You\u0026rsquoll also be given a Clearing number.  Search for courses you are interested in, and when you have found one you want to study, call the university or college and ask them if they will accept you. You\u0026rsquoll need to give them your Clearing number.  Once you have found one you are happy with, and they have said they will take you, you can add the course through Track.  Q: How do I add a Clearing choice?  A: Once you\u0026rsquove chosen your course and the university or college has said they\u0026rsquoll accept you, click \u0026ldquoadd clearing choice on the Track system and fill in the course details.  The university will then confirm your place.  Filling in and submitting the course details means you have definitely accepted the offer, so if the university confirms it, it will show as an acceptance on your \u0026ldquochoices page in Track.  You can only add one choice at a time. You\u0026rsquoll be able to add a different one if the university or college does not confirm your place.  Q: How long does Clearing take?  A: How long it takes depends on how long you want to take to make a choice, and how long it takes for the university or college you choose to confirm your place.  Q: How does Clearing work in Scotland?  A: Clearing works the same way for all students, regardless of where they live in the UK.  Q: When do universities get A-level results?  A: Universities receive prospective students\u0026rsquo grades in the days before A-level results day under strict embargo to allow them to confirm whether applicants have gained the required results. Students can sign in to Track on ucas from 8am on August 16, where they will be able to see if they\u0026rsquove been accepted.  Q: Is it easy to get into university through Clearing?  A: There are around 30,000 courses available in Clearing, and each one will have different grade and qualification requirements.  You should think carefully about what you want to do and where you want to study, as well as whether you meet the requirements to be accepted on to the course.  There is now no cap on the number of students a university or college can admit, so many institutions will still be looking for good candidates for their degree courses through Clearing.

It can be time consuming, and a certain resilience is required, it is a different type of volunteering, he said.  \u0026ldquoIn the past we\u0026rsquove learned that if you don\u0026rsquot send out a strong message, we can recruit people but have a high drop off rate when people find out what is actually involved.  Mr McAdam said the posters were only one element of a wider campaign which will stress the importance of the decisions panels can make and panel members as a force for good in their local community.      The campaign launched by @CHSscotland to recruit new panel members has generated debate. We knew this would be the case and tested and researched including with young people.

The adverts also aim to attract younger volunteers, he said, with the average age of a panel member being 53. \u0026ldquoYoung people and those who work with them have told us for a number of years that they want to see panel members\u0026nbsp closer in age to them.

But now one of Scotland\u0027s ancient seats of learning has launched evening classes in a language many of its scholars have derided: north-east Scots.  Aberdeen University\u0027s Elphinstone Institute has devised 10-week workshops in Doric, to help both locals and newcomers to the region learn to speak - and more importantly - write in the mither leid.  The Institute\u0027s Alistair Heather said: \u0026ldquoRecent figures show that the Scots language - which includes Doric - is spoken by around half of the entire population of the north-east and used by 1.5 million people across Scotland.  \"As the largest minority language in Europe, Scots is experiencing a real boost with so many new works and new translations into the tongue.  \"Whilst north-east Scots can be heard throughout the region, and can often been seen in signage or adverts, people seldom get the chance to learn it as a written language.\"  Mr Heather writes in north-east Scots himself including features for The Herald and a column for our sister paper The National. But he is still encountering some readers - including fluent or regular speakers of Scots - who find it strange to see what is normally a spoken dialect written down.  The workshops, which begin in September, are not just aimed to help people find ways to put their language down on paper. Mr Heather said the courses would also help speakers improve their fluency and range of expression and learn a little about history.  BACKGROUND: How Scots-speaking areas voted No  He said: \"The workshops will focus on how people can use the language in their daily lives, and by the end of the first block of workshops they will have sent a tweet, made a Facebook post, some verse and even a letter to the press in north-east Scots!  \"It will also invite newer arrivals to Scotland and the north-east to take a chance to learn and understand the speech and literary traditions of their new hame. Language can be the key to unlock the culture of the north-east and to help new arrivals settle in to the area.\"  Social media has thrust all the dialects of Scots in to the public sphere with people tweeting or Facebooking as they speak, rather than as they were taught to write at school. However, there is a large corpus of historic and modern literature in the language which can be studied too.  North-east Scots is routinely referred to as Doric - even by its speakers - despite the term\u0027s derogatory background.    Alistair Heather  Until last century all Scots dialects, including those of the central belt, and Northumbrian were called Doric in what was thought to be a joking reference to an ancient Greek language.  Athenians - or Attics - considered the speech or Dorians, Doric, to be rougher than their refined dialect.  Several parts of the North-East have the among the highest prevalence of Scots speakers, with 49 per cent of the population of Aberdeenshire saying they know the language. Knowledge of Scots falls in Edinburgh. The last census showed more than 311,000 of its 460,000 inhabitants of the Athens of the North could not understand, speak, read or write in Doric or any other Scots dialect.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116890.jpg","title":"Prince Charles to launch Highland Games initiative","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe decided to act after seeing a steady decline in athletes taking part in the Mey Games, which he has attended every year since 2002.The prince \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland \u0026ndash hopes the initiative will provide a more secure and better future for the games.Robert Lovie of The Prince\u0026rsquos Foundation, which is involved in the proposal, said the prince was aware of a lack of competition in the heavy and other traditional events at the Mey Games.\u0026ldquoHe was aware of it and wanted to do something about it, Mr Lovie, the foundation\u0026rsquos director of outreach, said.\u0026ldquoThe prince has had an interest in Highland Games since he was a little boy and attended the Braemar Gathering.

He will train youth leaders in the area to pass on the skills and techniques used in tossing the caber, tug-of-war and hammer-throwing.He said: \u0026ldquoThere are currently few routes into Highland Games for young people in Scotland.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Thursday 16 Aug 2018 10:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 30-year-old grappled with police after rowing with a doorman at the Royal Yacht Hotel in St Helier on Wednesday.            A female officer suffered bruising after he tried to break free from his handcuffs.            He was fined £2,000 and ordered to pay £250 compensation at Jersey Magistrates’ Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to resisting arrest and common assault.After the hearing, Cipriani released a statement saying: “I want to start with a heartfelt apology.“To my club, teammates, supporters and most importantly the police.“They have a tough and vital job and I’m mortified that, earlier this week, I acted in a way that I hugely regret. I am truly sorry.“I would also like to put on record the words of the Magistrate Sarah Fitz who publicly stated that ‘it was a minor incident’ and ‘a fine is more than sufficient’.            “I was wrong to argue with a bouncer, and pull on his camera tie. I was also wrong to resist arrest.“This is why I pleaded guilty to these two charges and all other charges were dropped by the prosecution. I was initially confused as to why I was being arrested by three officers.“This led me to react in the wrong manner for a matter of seconds, seeking to hold off the police officers rather than accepting their decision.“It goes without saying, given the words of the Magistrate, that I didn’t strike anyone or initiate aggression in any way.            “I was on a team night out with the whole squad. I am grateful to the club, who have been fully supportive.“I would like to publicly thank the Magistrate and the police and, once again, apologise both to them and to the public.”Prosecutor Samantha Morris said the incident started when the doorman stopped Cipriani from walking out of the bar with two drinks.He called the police after the fly-half became “physically aggressive”, she added.She said he “refused to understand why he was being arrested” and “tensed up”, refusing to put his arms behind his back.            Cipriani told police “These wrists are gold, loosen the cuffs”, according to The Sun newspaper.He had one hand in a handcuff but broke his other arm free, pushed towards the female officer and grabbed hold of her shirt, the court heard.The police woman sustained bruising to her right bicep and reddening to her chest, Miss Morris said.Mr Preston said that when Cipriani was approached outside the Pomme d’Or hotel by police he was “confused as to why he was immediately arrested and why he was being handcuffed”.“He is very sorry for his behaviour, which lasted a few seconds,” he added.Cipriani, wearing an open-necked checked shirt, kept his head down as he emerged from court.He ignored reporters’ questions before getting in to a waiting car.Gloucester Rugby chief executive Stephen Vaughan described the incident as “very disappointing to be associated with”.He said: “The incident in question was over in a matter of seconds and was a reaction to the conduct of other parties involved.”He said Cipriani “knows his responsibilities and is aware of the impact of this type of incident on the club”.“However, Danny is a Gloucester Rugby player and will receive our full support as we focus on the exciting season ahead.”Cipriani was on the island with his club during a pre-season tour, including a training session with the Jersey Reds team.He was originally also charged with larceny and being disorderly on licensed premises, but those charges were dropped.The incident happened just hours after England cricketer Ben Stokes was cleared of affray following a city centre brawl outside Bristol nightclub Mbargo.The 27-year-old was recalled to England’s Test squad after he was acquitted by a jury on Tuesday.Cipriani has been in trouble before. He was convicted of drink-driving after he crashed his black Mercedes into a taxi in London on June 1 2015.He was ordered to pay a total of £7,620 in fines and costs and banned from driving for 18 months.In 2013, he was hospitalised after being hit by a bus during a night out in Leeds."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

For a start, with formal recognition in 2005, but usage stretching back to 1969, the Shetland flag was at the forefront of the modern local vexillological movement.                However, it is certainly true that since Caithness started its ­campaign for a flag in 2014 that more communities have followed suit every year. This is no doubt as a result of the benefits to those ­communities becoming more and more evident.             There are many reasons that a community may decide to develop a flag, with each community ­having its own unique circumstances. However in my experience there are three top-level types of benefit that communities who develop flags enjoy.            The first is perhaps the most ­readily apparent, the benefit around internal identity. A flag provides the community with a symbol that they can rally around and share, thus promoting their sense of togetherness. Obviously this is apparent during times of local celebration, much as the national flag is also used in such circumstances. However it is important to recognise that the positive power of flags extends to times of hardship as well. Barra is a notable example where in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack their flag was used very prominently on the island to express their sense of loss and ­solidarity. Secondly there is a notable ­benefit for communities regarding the external visibility a flag can bring for their area. In 2004, the then Scottish Executive found that the Saltire was the best symbol for ­promoting Scotland abroad, and for the same reason a flag can prove to be a strong and versatile brand for any sub-national community too.The well-established Shetland and Orkney flags are often seen on car stickers, badges and even on the packaging of other merchandise as well as actual flags. Every time the flags are used in this way they can act as a powerful branding for those areas. However, even younger flags have proved that they can achieve similar benefits – the Caithness flag appearing on the Wick Academy FC team strip, for example.Finally, there is an overall benefit to our sense of national identity too. Like a patchwork quilt the individual pieces need to be preserved and promoted to keep the whole fabric in good condition.             There are many places around the world that make good use of ­sub-national and national identities to complement each other. ­However, Scotland has one of the richest histories of celebrating not only national symbolism but those of its people and places too, and it is renowned for its love of ceremony. So much so that it is clear that Scotland’s sense of localism is core to its historic sense of national identity and understanding of itself.This can be seen in many of the unique aspects of Scottish culture and symbolism. Start with a type of symbol so associated with our country – tartan. The huge range of tartans is something that enhances our understanding of the country rather than undermining it. These cover places and communities, as well as tartans for individuals, families and clans.It is a feeling of belonging to one of our iconic names, families or clans that is another important part of historic Scottish identity. This has given rise to a distinctive character for heraldry in Scotland with unifying themes for particular surnames linking individuals’ personal arms in a display of unity. In Scottish ­heraldry itself there are many examples of historic emblems associated with not only clans but regions themselves. For instance the lymphad (galley) is emblematic of the islands and many of the families that hail from there. The Caithness galley even made its way onto their community flag. And there are many more from the Dundonian lilies to the Lochaber axes.In his book Scots Heraldry, former Lord Lyon Sir Thomas Innes notes that the general uptake of heraldry in Scotland is historically far higher per capita than in England. This is something he ties to the sense of family and clan belonging. Though to have personal arms recognised with the ancient authority charged with ­protecting the country’s national symbols, the Court of the Lord Lyon, only further exemplifies the link between sub-national identities and our sense of Scottishness.            The Honorary Vexillologist role within the Court of the Lord Lyon will be assisting the development of community flags and also to support the continuing enrichment of our national symbolism through helping to develop civic and ­personal heraldry. It is this richness that not only deepens our national identity but also gives it a healthy breadth as well. It is absolutely no surprise that flags have taken off so strongly in recent years as they are only one more instance of an important foundation to our national identity, and a lot of the honorary vexillologist’s focus will be given over to them. Each type of symbol ­mentioned plays a significant part in realising this, but each does this to their own strengths. Community flags have found a unique place in providing their people with a recognisable, versatile and highly visible ­symbol that is free to use by all. This makes these flags not only perfect to be seen next to the Saltire but they enrich it too. It is to Scotland’s great pride that the Court of the Lord Lyon continues a centuries long duty of protecting our national symbols but is also able to empower the nation’s communities in developing their own.Philip Tibbetts is honorary vexillologist for Scotland’s heraldic authority, the Court of the Lord Lyon."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784777.1534404275!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin the massive elephant in the room at the snp s conference","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The lack of a debate on Andrew Wilson\u0026#8217s Growth Commission at SNP conference is a startling omission, writes Tom Peterkin.                Councillor Christopher McEleny is fast emerging as one of the SNP’s more colourful characters. Twice he has stood to be SNP depute leader. Twice he has been defeated, firstly by Angus Robertson, and most recently by Keith Brown, the former Economy Secretary who is now Nicola Sturgeon’s right-hand man as far as the party is concerned.            Despite being on the receiving end of comprehensive defeats, the Inverclyde councillor refuses to slide back into the relative obscurity of local authority politics.            It was earlier this month that Mr McEleny found himself in the headlines when the judge in an employment tribunal ruled that his support for Scottish independence qualified as a “philosophical belief”. The conclusion was reached by judge Frances Eccles in a case that saw Mr McEleny pursue his former employer, the Ministry of Defence, claiming he had been unfairly targeted over his views.The background to the case was that around the time of his first unsuccessful attempt to become SNP depute leader in 2016, he was told that his security clearance had been revoked for his job as an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith, North Ayrshire.He said he was interviewed by national security officials on issues including his pro-independence views. After being suspended from his job, he left it, claiming he was unfairly targeted for his stance on leaving the UK and his support for the “social democratic values” of the SNP.READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission report: Five key points            In her judgment, Judge Eccles rather neatly summed up exactly how Mr McEleny felt about Scottish independence.“The claimant was clear in his evidence that he does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland”, she said. “It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.”So there you have it. Mr McEleny’s belief in breaking up the UK runs through him like letters through a stick of rock. His desire for indep­endence is so strong that it trumps pro-indy arguments based on the notion that securing a Yes vote is the best way to improve Scotland economically and socially.Given that independence – come what may and damn the consequences – appears to be an existential part of the councillor’s being, it was perhaps somewhat surprising to see his most recent contribution to internal SNP politics.            Earlier this week Mr McEleny took to Twitter to reveal that the party’s latest independence blueprint will not be debated at its October conference. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” that the list of 32 motions for debate in Glasgow did not include any of Andrew Wilson’s much-vaunted Growth Commission or his proposal to stick with the pound for around a decade after independence. Even the man for whom independence is a “philosophical belief” is objecting to the party’s failure to take a long and hard look at the harsh economic reality at independence. A similar row erupted before the SNP’s most recent conference in June, which happened to take place shortly after Mr Wilson published his 354-page magnum opus.Despite the fact that the SNP document was the hot topic of the moment, there was no formal debate on its proposals, which are absolutely fundamental to the party’s next drive for independence. Instead, discussion of the document was relegated to a fringe meeting. That meeting offered some explanation as to why it might suit the SNP not to pore over the document in public. It was easily the stormiest session of the conference as the former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan criticised its contents. READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission strengthens case for union, claims pro-UK think tankThe future plotted by the commission would, said Mr Kerevan, leave Scotland “at the mercy” of the banks, because its plans to keep the pound without Bank of England protection for a decade would hinder the ability to grow the Scottish economy. This, he argued, would put the poor at risk.            The difficulty for the SNP is that Mr Kerevan’s views are shared by many who, like him, can be found on the left of the party. Mr Wilson won praise for constructing a more realistic case for independence than that made in Alex Salmond’s white paper published ahead of the 2014 referendum.But realism can have its drawbacks. Mr Wilson’s approach to cutting Scotland’s £13.3 billion deficit has seen the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warn that Scotland would see a “continuation of austerity”.One can understand why the SNP leadership might be reluctant to air these points and internal divisions at their autumn shindig. Rather, the Growth Commission is to be discussed internally at a series of SNP National Assemblies. The outcome of these discussions are then scheduled to be brought before party conference in spring next year or the National Council this coming December. In the meantime, it feels strange to be heading to another SNP conference where the biggest elephant in the room will be Mr Wilson’s indy blueprint.Or as the Inverclyde councillor who is rapidly becoming the SNP’s best-known controversialist put it: “How can we not be debating the biggest contribution to the independence case since 2014?”That may not amount to a “philosophical belief” for Councillor McEleny, but it is still a pretty good point."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4785103.1534418295!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish independence activists demand nicola sturgeon use the mandate","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

A fringe group, Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba, has shared an invite with its followers to attend the party’s showpiece event in October at the Glasgow SEC with the hashtag #UsetheMandate.            The First Minister said in 2017 that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster it would convert her already “cast-iron” mandate for a referendum into a “triple lock” one.            But a disappointing performance at that year’s general election - which saw the SNP lose 21 of the seats the party previously won in 2015 - saw Ms Sturgeon “reset” her plans.Sir John Curtice, the country’s leading pollster, last week predicted a second referendum on Scottish independence was “unlikely” to take place in the next five years.With the Scottish Government forced to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, another vote on the constitution would be “kicked in the long grass”, he said.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon ‘will kick IndyRef2 into the long grass’Independence activists regularly take to the streets to make their demands for a second referendum known. A march in Glasgow in May was hailed by organisers as the biggest of its kind to date, with more than 40,000 estimated to have taken part.            Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said: “The SNP’s famous discipline is beginning to wilt, and it looks set to do so in spectacular style with a demo outside its own conference.“Nicola Sturgeon has marched her independence diehards to the top of the hill and now they’re furious about being left in limbo.“She should do what’s in Scotland’s best interests – march them back down and take another referendum off the table altogether.”An SNP spokesman said: “As the First Minister has made clear, she will provide an update this autumn. Given the Tories’ shambolic mishandling of things, the terms of Brexit are currently far from clear – but it is positive to see people from across the country continue to campaign passionately for independence.”              READ MORE: The massive elephant in the room at the SNP’s conference"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

The intention is that it can be used in all weather and not only by tennis players and other sports enthusiasts but also by the likes of the Cubs and Scouts, Guides, playgroups, charities and even for children\u0027s parties and ceilidhs.\nThe mystery benefactor came forward after reading last week\u0027s appeal in the Strathy.\nA spokesman for the donor said: \"The extent of the community\u0027s input into the campaign was really impressive and that\u0027s what swung it.\n\"Local people had put in a major effort to raise their share of the cost and the project deserves to get off the ground.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 16 Aug 2018 10:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37215278.ece/3d20d/AUTOCROP/w300square/img-2692_orig.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast twelfth cleanup costs revealed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt nodeal brexit would be a mistake we would regret for generations","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

that the Government would consider EU proposals that demanded accepting European environmental and social legislation, in order to facilitate a free trade agreement.\n\nThe comments came in an interview with ITV News after a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister as part of a three-day tour of Northern Europe.\n\nWhen asked whether he was presenting the Government’s Brexit plan as “take it or leave it”, Mr Hunt answered: “No, but it is a framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based and I’ve been to several countries and met seven foreign ministers and am meeting more in the weeks ahead and I’m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I’ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome.”\n\n\n\nIt (no-deal Brexit) would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the UK would make concessions regarding environmental and social legislation, Mr Hunt responded: “I think we have to see what their proposal was, some of those things can have an impact on the level playing field, some won’t.”\n\nDiscussing the risk of no proper negotiated deal he said: “It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe.”\n\nAsked to compare himself with Boris Johnson’s approach as foreign secretary he said: “I think the role of the foreign secretary is to go around foreign capitals and point out the implications of not getting a deal are profound in terms of our friendship and corporation with foreign countries across a whole range of areas.”\n\nMr Hunt went on to respond to reports that Brussels Brexit negotiators were concerned they were being bugged by British spies.\n\nOfficials had raised security concerns after the UK obtained sensitive documents “within hours” of them being discussed, according to the Daily .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt is touring northern Europe (David Cheskin/PA)\n\n\n\n\nSabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, reportedly told officials at a European Council working party on exit talks that “it could not be excluded” that British intelligence had penetrated their meetings.\n\nMr Hunt, when asked about the rumours, said: “I’m Foreign Secretary and foreign secretaries never comment on such matters but you are a journalist and you don’t have any trouble finding out what is going on in those meeting just like you have no problems in finding out what’s happening in our London meetings.”\n\nA European Commission spokesman told journalists in Brussels at a regular briefing: “The commission’s position today is that we cannot comment on this press report.”\n\nIt comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier are not involved in the latest round of discussions, which are focused on the Irish border and future relations, and are due to finish on Friday.\n\nThe spokesman said: “As this week’s round is at technical level there won’t be a meeting between Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab.\n\n“We will confirm in due course whether a subsequent meeting has been arranged.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts moira road in lisburn closed following accident","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mps would vote on paisleys commons suspension if he resigns to force byelection","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He came to the UK as a child refugee and has two degrees in Space Engineering. He\u0027s looking for a JOB IN FINANCE.\nPlease RT! DM me for his CV if you want to hire someone smart who thinks outside the box🙌 \npic.twitter/cgQ1lBfBNY\n\n— Mary Engleheart (@MaryEngleheart) \nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“At the International Rescue Committee I see and hear stories every day that show that when refugees are given the opportunity to succeed, they thrive,” she said.\n\n“Mohamed is living proof of the ingenuity and courage of refugees. I decided to tweet his picture and see whether anyone could help to find him a job.”\n\nThe 22-year-old came to the UK as a refugee from Libya when he was three.\n\nThanks to his mother’s passion for educating her children, Mohamed went on to study aerospace engineering at Southampton University and is finishing his masters degree in space engineering at UCL.\n\nHe is shocked by the attention his ingenuity is getting.\n\n“It really is overwhelming,” he told the Press Association.\n\n“The main reason I had the confidence to stand at Canary Wharf was because I thought no one I knew would be there so there was no reason to be embarrassed!”\n\n\nGreat to see there are many options to choose from. We’d love to see Mohamed’s CV as we’ve got some great graduate programmes in our Global Banking and Markets business.

I knew whenever I was offered an interview I would do really well, because that’s in my control.”\n\nWhen these didn’t work out, Mohamed began to think outside the box. Inspired by David Casarez, a young man who took a similar approach in Silicon Valley, he hopped on the Tube, hoping to land an opportunity.\n\n“I’m hoping for a job in a client-facing role related to finance,” he said.\n\n“For the last two or so years I’ve had a keen interest in the markets and how the events of the world can have a drastic impact on the markets. I’m particularly interested in using AI to help predict market movements.”\n\n\nUPDATE: Mohamed has three job interviews lined up this week.
