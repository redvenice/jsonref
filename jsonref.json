In Wild Oats, Epstein had taken not just plot structures or character ideas from Amis’s debut, The Rachel Papers, but had duplicated whole sentences. “The boundary between influence and plagiarism will always be vague,” Amis wrote – but Epstein had “decisively breached” that “hazy” line. Rather magnanimously, Amis went on to praise Epstein as a writer of talent he simply believed that the similarities ought to be made public.That boundary remains hazy. Among the 13 novels longlisted for this year’s International Booker prize, announced last week, is Red Dog by Willem Anker, translated from Afrikaans by Michiel W Heyns. It tells the story of Coenraad de Buys, a seven-foot agent of war who lived and died in the violent, fractured Cape Colony. When I reviewed the novel, unfavourably, in the Times Literary Supplement, my objections lay not just in what I found to be a derivative, repetitious and at times deeply unpleasant book, but in a few sections that bore a striking resemblance to those in Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian, which raised – as I wrote then – “some discussion about the nature and justification of plagiarism”.Take the following passage, in which Buys leads his gang of outlaws into an attack “like a horde from Hell more abhorrent even than the fire and brimstone land of Christian Reckoning, skirling and shrieking, clothed in smoke like those phantoms in regions beyond certainty and sense where the eye wanders and the lip shudders and drools.”Here: McCarthy, on a similar approach from a Comanche ambush: “Like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than the brimstone land of Christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right knowing where the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.”To discuss the concept of plagiarism in art is to grasp for something very slippery. Most crucially, it should be noted that a wide range of intertextual manoeuvres are fundamental to creativity. Mark Twain famously wrote to Helen Keller – who stood accused of plagiarising a short story – that “substantially all ideas are secondhand”. Curiously, the application of these tactics to prose literature is frequently deemed worse than when applied to poetry, music or the visual arts. Literary genius is oddly considered sui generis. In answer, we can take Jonathan Lethem’s marvellous essay The Ecstasy of Influence, which deconstructs ideas about originality by forging an argument made almost entirely from fragments, taking to the very limit a line from Montaigne’s essays: “I have gathered a posy of other men’s flowers, and nothing but the thread that binds them is mine own.”Appropriation – used deftly – seeks to undermine, emphasise or distort meaning, to invert narrative or encourage fresh readings. See Eliot (The Waste Land), Borges (in Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, he invites us to consider the “staggering” differences between two identical pieces of text), Kathy Acker (Blood and Guts in High School). McCarthy himself (as Michael Lynn Crews, the author of a guide to McCarthy’s influence, has noted) has frequently made use of other authors, weaving neat “phraseological appropriations” into his own books, particularly when they signal back to writers with whom his work shares a philosophical reference. (His borrowings run further still: he once added an annexe to his house using bricks salvaged from James Agee’s old home.) Literature would be left poorer if authors felt stifled to the point that they could not experiment with that which went before them.I am certainly not precious about McCarthy: his influence is wide, and his sales will not be affected by this affair. And books are, as he has said, made out of books, and we should consider the value in attempts to create them anew. What matters is that they are authentic, that they move with conviction to recast words.So why is it that these sections from Red Dog stick in the craw? The first objection is that the book does not maintain conviction in its intertextual experiments. Buys, who frequently speaks to the reader outside the narrative, claims his omniscience and his “plundering” of texts “far and wide” – and yet we never sense that the book aims towards a rich allusiveness. Instead we are presented with a clunky act of mimicry that does little to impress upon the reader some deeper purpose.Second: a reader unfamiliar with McCarthy’s book could reasonably believe these lengthy sections to be wholly of Anker’s design. Those of us who are familiar with McCarthy do not “stumble upon the remains” of his work, as Anker writes in Red Dog’s acknowledgments, so much as discover a corpse with rouged cheeks. Most interestingly, this explicit openness about McCarthy is only present in the English edition, not the original Afrikaans – a language into which McCarthy has never been translated. Anker’s translator Heyns has objected to my criticisms with the response that the novelist names McCarthy – but as McCarthy is not named in the Afrikaans edition, nor published in that language, both seem to me to undermine an already dubious line of defence. Perhaps the International Booker judges will agree – or perhaps that boundary is still too hazy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa7df9d0b93cb7f0eb7a860bc176c36822f718d/0_367_5530_3319/master/5530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73b93ee53b04e6c3f371f30558accf61","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected small businesses in the uk","story":"We would like to hear about how the coronavirus outbreak has impacted small and medium enterprisesAnalysts have warned that transport groups, hospitality chains, and luxury goods makers and retailers will be among those hardest hit by the coronavirus.We want to hear from small and medium enterprises in the UK about how they have been affected by the outbreak.Have you noticed an impact on exports from China?

It plans to produce 330,000 vehicles a year by 2021.The cars are capable of travelling for 205-340 miles on a single charge, and Smith believes the deal with British Gas could “give customers even more confidence, as they make the switch to emission-free driving”.The collaboration could help British Gas fend off rising competition from a string of challenger brands by relying more on energy services such as boiler repairs, insurance cover and home car charging to generate revenue.The agreement with VW comes less than a year after the owner of British Gas, Centrica, struck a deal with Ford to market its car chargers and EV-charging tariffs from US carmaker’s forecourts across the UK.A similar strategy is being pursued by Ovo Energy, the UK’s second-largest energy supplier, and Scottish Power, which have both collaborated with Nissan on small-scale deals to help install compatible home chargers for its Nissan Leaf model.Centrica is under pressure to prove to shareholders that its strategy will pay off, after reporting a loss of more than £1bn for 2019, after the government’s energy price cap cut earnings at British Gas to all-time lows.The chief executive, Iain Conn, is to step down this year and the company is yet to announce a successor.Sarwjit Sambhi, the head of Centrica’s consumer business, said it was committed to finding “a pathway for the energy transition”, which is in line with the Paris agreement by “helping our customers reduce their emissions, reducing the emissions of the energy system as a whole, and reducing our own”.“We made material progress on all of these during 2019 and are committed to a plan for delivering net zero by 2050,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f016774aabeae76f4fee0eb898ac088fae5331c3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c551e73c700b997c24bcb44e740bf52a","title":"market coronavirus vaccine us health virus pharmaceutical business","story":"The near-total lack of interest from markets means there’s precious little foundation for scientists to build onCoronavirus appears to be with us for the long haul. Despite the unprecedented attempts at isolation and containment, with about 50 million people locked down and economic activity virtually halted in China, cases have spiked in recent weeks. Sixty-seven countries are now reporting a total of more than 8,000 infections outside China. The World Health Organization has been wary of using the word pandemic, but last week it advised countries to prepare as if one were imminent.On the same day, in a rare bit of good news, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it had already received the first candidate for a vaccine against the novel virus, now being called Sars-CoV-2 – produced by a company called Moderna – and that trials could begin as early as April. Anthony Fauci, the institute’s director, said that just three months between discovery and trials was a new record, noting that “nothing has ever gone that fast”, before dropping the other shoe: even with the rapid start, completing the trials and scaling up production would take until at least next year, and there was no guarantee it would even get to that stage.Vaccines remain science’s best – and virtually only – weapon against viruses, and yet the timeline for developing a vaccine, measured in years, seems hopelessly mismatched to a pandemic, which can spread, kill and often disappear in a matter of weeks or months. The modern record doesn’t inspire much confidence. There have been multiple international viral outbreaks over the past two decades – Sars-CoV-1, Mers, Zika, Ebola – that all provoked similar races to produce a vaccine. Yet to date only the efforts on Ebola have been successful, with a vaccine being approved last year.Why is this? Vaccines for epidemics have to overcome the same scientific and regulatory hurdles as other promising treatments, but they also suffer from a near total lack of interest from the markets that drive the pharmaceutical industry. Only a few massive companies retain the ability to develop and produce a vaccine from start to finish, partly because of the expense and the timescales involved and partly because they’ve consolidated the patents on manufacturing processes – a situation analysts openly call an oligopoly. A success for one of these companies is a treatment for a widespread, persistent disease that they can sell every single year in perpetuity. The last industry blockbuster was Merck’s HPV vaccine Gardasil, in development for nearly 20 years, released in 2006, and still bringing in over £1bn annually. There is no way to easily apply their slow-burn research and profit model to an epidemic. As the leader of the UK’s Ebola response, Adrian Hill, told the Independent in 2014, “Unless there’s a big market it’s not worth the while of a mega-company … There was no business case to make an Ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most.”Even if research begins during a pandemic, the unpredictable nature of outbreaks means work is often shelved if the crisis dies down, and so progress halts until the next time a similar infection flares up. Sars and Mers were also coronaviruses but after they petered out, work on them essentially stalled. Jason Schwartz, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said as much to the Atlantic earlier this month: “Had we not set the Sars vaccine research programme aside, we would have had a lot more of this foundational work that we could apply to this new, closely related virus.” Clinical trials take nearly a year at minimum, but sustaining basic research on viruses known to have epidemic potential means when a novel variant pops up, we’re not starting from zero each time.The current setup is often the worst of both worlds – too slow to pick up research on new threats because the money isn’t there, and too quick to drop it if it can’t be sure the money will be there in the future. It’s a highly market-dependent system, and the market usually fails us. Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, previously declared the entire research and development system “not fit for purpose” for epidemics.The question is, how can we fix it? The quick delivery of the first Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidate suggests that some recent efforts are paying off. The Moderna vaccine is in part backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organisation based in Norway and funded by governments and foundations such as the Wellcome Trust. Its goal is to keep research attention on potentially epidemic diseases, even when there isn’t an outbreak, and to develop broader treatments it calls “platforms” that could be tailored to multiple virus variants. For example, the vaccine sent to NIAID is RNA-based, making it far easier to customise and faster to produce than traditional protein-based vaccines. And CEPI was already funding a DNA-based vaccine for another coronavirus, as well as a platform to block viral cell entry, that it hopes to quickly adapt to Sars-CoV-2.These kinds of programmes can maintain long-term vision and planning, foster international collaboration and supercharge vaccine research – but they still can’t deliver a vaccine at pandemic scale, because the biotech firms and universities they work with are simply too small, working on the order of millions of doses. The French pharma giant Sanofi alone produces over a billion doses per year. Even the US army, after producing a promising Zika vaccine in 2017, had to sign over the rights to Sanofi to get it produced. (The deal later fell through after criticism over profiteering by watchdog organisations and senator Bernie Sanders.)There have been calls over the years, usually after an outbreak or a terrorist attack, for the state to match its commitment to research – the US government has spent more than £500m on coronavirus research over the past 20 years – with the manufacturing capacity to become truly self-reliant. The US had a facility like that until the 1990s, producing vaccines for the army at pennies per dose. The UK recently announced a new state of the art facility in Oxford that would allow the government to manufacture its own vaccines, an incredible step, but it won’t be operational until 2022.A panicked world will be watching the vaccines inch through clinical trials over the next year.

In reality it was made by someone who was clearly skilled in their craft around 1,000-800BC. “The skill and care with which it has been put together is remarkable,” he said. “It is just exquisite.”It comes from a period that is often misunderstood, associated with people living in huts or caves. Wilkin said that was understandable. “This is a subject, a period, that hasn’t been taught in school curriculums until very recently … I didn’t learn about it at school.”The pendant is decorated with semi-circles and geometric motifs, and on one side is a stylised solar design, reflecting the importance of the sun and its path across the sky to bronze age farmers.That depiction of the sun is seen in famous objects as the Trundholm sun chariot in Copenhagen and a small number of gold pendants found in Ireland, “but we haven’t really seen it on British objects until now,” said Wilkins.The pendant was found in a landscape that would have been boggy and wet during the bronze age. Curators think it would have been intentionally cast into the water as an offering, much as people today throw coins into fountains.It was found by a metal detectorist who wants to remain anonymous. All the correct procedures were adhered to in that it was reported to the local finds liaison officer who notified the coroner and brought it to the British Museum under the treasure process.A coroner found it to be treasure and the independent treasure valuation committee recommended to the culture secretary a valuation of £250,000.It will probably be known as the Shropshire sun pendant and will go on display from November at Shrewsbury museum and art gallery, near the find site. In 2021 it will come to the British Museum in London and will be displayed near other bronze age treasures such as the Mold gold cape.The pendant, 3.6cm by 4.7cm, is the second one ever found in Britain. The first was discovered during canal digging in Manchester in 1722 and was assumed by many experts to be Roman, because of its quality. It was last recorded in 1806 before disappearing from sight.Could it still be out there? “It is possible,” said Wilkin. “To find it would be astonishing but in some ways it wouldn’t surprise me. The weight of it means you wouldn’t necessarily think of melting it down for bullion. I do have a sneaking suspicion it is out there somewhere, just misunderstood or mislabelled.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3ef4a3ce6abc88f05a968b8cf50d67b0875a0b1/424_0_6288_3775/master/6288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c92ac540bbbf996eb22162513c7957","title":"heads and councils press for extra 55bn for struggling schools","story":"Exclusive: group says provision for Send pupils in particular is ‘woefully underfunded’An alliance of headteachers, school governors, councils and unions are to lobby the chancellor for a further £5.5bn a year to help schools in England to avoid financial difficulties and cuts.The coalition, involving almost every significant organisation involved in state schools – including the National Governors Association and a bipartisan group representing both Conservative and Labour-led councils – is writing to Rishi Sunak before next week’s budget seeking additional funds, with a focus on “woefully underfunded” provision for pupils with special education needs and disabilities (Send).“Nurseries, schools and colleges are all struggling to meet growing costs and demands, with many having to reduce what they offer in order to meet their budgets,” the group says in a letter to Sunak and Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament’s education select committee.A string of local authorities in England have been told by the government to drain their school budgets to help pay for their special needs obligations.Sabrina Hobbs, the principal of Severndale specialist academy in Shrewsbury, one of the largest special schools in England, with children aged from two to 19, said any further budget cuts could imperil staff and students.“The squeeze on special schools will soon begin to impact on the most vulnerable children within our communities as it will become impossible to accommodate their needs as resources and staffing are stripped right back,” Hobbs said.“Leadership has been cut, management has been cut and curriculum opportunities have been cut. There is nothing else without risking health and safety and quality of life.”Headteachers who back the lobbying say they are still being forced to reduce staff numbers and make cuts to essential provision, despite the government’s promises of an additional £7.1bn in school funding by 2022-23.“Much of that extra funding will be swallowed up on rising costs including increased and unfunded pay rises that have been introduced. This jeopardises the promised real-terms increased budgets for the schools and pupils themselves,” the letter says.The coalition says that once inflation and increases to teacher pay are taken into account, more than four out of five schools will be worse off this year than five years ago. Sixth forms and colleges will continue to be hardest hit.James McInnes, a Conservative councillor who heads the f40 group representing the local authorities with the lowest school funding in England, said: “Although we very much welcome the government’s investment, our analysis is that £12.6bn was needed across the country, so that falls short by £5.5bn.“So we need to work together as a coalition of unions, local authorities, teachers and parents, and say that while we welcome the extra funding, we also need to keep the pressure on central government so they understand that’s not the end of the story, that additional funding is still required.”McInnes, Devon county council’s cabinet member for children’s services and schools, said special needs funding requirements were causing budget deficits in councils around the country.“In Devon in the current financial year, we’re £21.5m overspent in the high needs block of the dedicated schools grant – that’s mainly special education needs and disabilities. Next year if there aren’t any changes, we’re projected to overspend about £45m.The Department for Education said: “This government wants to build an education system that boosts productivity, improves social mobility and equips children and adults with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the bright future that lies ahead.“That is why we are levelling up funding to ensure all schools have the right investment to deliver an outstanding education. On top of this, we are increasing high needs funding for local authorities by £780m next year, as well as £400m cash boost for 16-19 funding.”The letter to the chancellor will be backed by the main teaching and school leadership organisations including the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders and the National Education Union.The coalition includes Worth Less?, a group of headteachers who have been agitating for additional funding.Jules White, its founder and headteacher at Tanbridge House school in West Sussex, said: “At the moment our attention should rightly focus on events affecting the whole country. But even after the welcome government investment set for April 2020, cash-starved schools still require a major long-term funding plan to meet the needs of children and their families over the next 10 years.“The will from every school and every teacher to deliver a world-class system is there, but the resources are not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ea760e21e5445af618a703978532b095537bd3/0_154_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd55b9aa736fc1fb7f98050b027d45fc","title":"focus coronavirus shows need climate law says eu official frans timmermans","story":"Frans Timmermans calls for bloc to legislate so it does not lose track of net zero targetTensions at the Greek-Turkish border and the coronavirus show why the European Union needs a climate law that binds member states to net zero emissions by 2050, the EU’s top official on climate action has said.Frans Timmermans, a European commission vice-president who leads on the climate emergency, said the different crises facing Europe underscored the need for a climate law in order not to lose track of reducing emissions.The long-awaited climate law unveiled on Wednesday is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, a plan to transform Europe’s economy, promised by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, within her first 100 days.“It will be our compass for the next 30 years and it will guide us every step as we build a sustainable new growth model,” Von der Leyen said announcing the law. Some political leaders have argued that the commission needs to focus on the protection of the EU’s external border, rather than the climate crisis – arguments that Timmermans rejected. “The focus this week should be completely on the happening in Syria, in Turkey and what is happening in Greece, should be on containing the coronavirus and solving it. That’s absolutely a priority,” he said. The climate law was “so important”, because “it allows you to focus on other things without losing track of what you need to do to reach climate neutrality”.“Even if the Eye of Sauron is on something else for a bit, the trajectory to 2050 will be clear,” he said, in a reference to the dark forces in the Lord of the Rings. “Because we discipline ourselves with the climate law.”Speaking to the  and six other European newspapers shortly before the law was published, Timmermans said the proposal was revolutionary because all EU legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by the mid-century.Even before the text was officially released, the climate activist Greta Thunberg and teenage school strike leaders across Europe gave a blistering verdict, accusing the commission of ignoring climate science.Thunberg, who is meeting Von der Leyen, Timmermans and the rest of the commission’s top team, described the law as “surrender”. In an open letter, she said it failed to respect the goal of capping global heating at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – an aspiration the EU signed up to in the 2015 Paris agreement.She repeated that message at a meeting with MEPs on the European parliament’s environment committee on Wednesday. “In November 2019 the European parliament declared a climate and environment emergency,” she said. “You stated that yes, the house is actually burning, this was no false alarm, but then you went back inside, finished your dinner and watched your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department.“When your house is on fire you don’t wait a few more years to start putting it out, and yet this is what the commission are proposing today.”Earlier at a private meeting with EU commissioners the teenage activist was told by Timmermans that the movement she started was the reason the European Green Deal and climate law exists.European Union leaders in 2019\u0026nbspagreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, meaning more emissions will be removed than expelled into the atmosphere.The climate law proposed by the European commission makes that 2050 promise legally-binding. If an EU member state fails to make progress, the commission can take it to the European court of justice, which has the power to impose hefty daily fines for non-compliance.The commission, the body that drafts and enforces EU law, describes the draft regulation as revolutionary, because all EU legislation – whether farming, energy or transport – will have to be consistent with the 2050 climate target.Climate campaigners, notably Greta Thunberg who described the law as “surrender”, argue that it does not go far enough to reduce emissions in the next decade – a critical window if the world is to avoid climate breakdown that will come from overshooting the aspiration agreed at the 2015 Paris climate talks to keep warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The climate law does not include an emissions-reduction target for 2030, although the commission will table a proposal in September.EU governments are likely to object to the powers the commission wants to give itself to propose climate targets for 2035, 2040 and 2045. Under the powerful legal tool of “delegated acts”, the EU executive would be able to set targets with limited input from ministers and MEPs. That could prove tricky with governments and the European parliament, who must approve the climate law before it comes into force.The climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the EU was aiming too low and its current targets on reducing emissions set in 2014 were not in line with the 1.5C goal.An IPCC report in 2018 showed that going beyond 1.5C, even by half a degree, would significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.Van Ypersele said the EU should be aiming for carbon neutrality one decade earlier. “If a region as technologically rich, as scientifically rich as the EU is only able to achieve that by 2050 how can you imagine that the rest of the world will do that by the same year? I don’t think it’s very likely.”A dozen EU member states have also voiced reservations about Timmermans’ timetable for proposing an EU climate target for 2030, widely seen as a crucial goal if the world is not to exceed its carbon budget.Timmermans plans to set out the EU’s 2030 goal in September, but the dozen countries argue this is too late to galvanise the rest of the world to make commitments at crucial UN climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year.The vice-president rejected these arguments, saying his officials needed the summer to do a thorough impact assessment of the 2030 goal. “If the commission were to come out with a not duly assessed number we would have months and months of discussion about a percentage and then the EU would not have a position either.”He said the EU’s 2030 target would be in time for the EU to have a position at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow.Timmermans also voiced confidence in the British government’s preparations for Cop26. Campaigners have been concerned about a shaky start, with the new Cop26 president – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed three weeks ago, after his predecessor was abruptly sacked. The UK has yet to set out a strategy or timetable for the cconference, widely seen as critical to getting the world back on track with the 2015 Paris goals.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. “The UK has formidable capacities in this area,” he said, adding that Brexit had not created a rift between the EU and UK over climate goals. “Brexit weakens the EU, full stop. And, in my view, weakens the UK, full stop,” he said. “I don’t see any object of discord, or disagreement or confrontation between EU and United Kingdom on this issue, of making a success of Glasgow.”The climate law means governments failing to meet targets could be taken to the European court of justice and fined.Timmermans said “the hardest, hardest thing we will have to do” is guaranteeing that the European Green Deal will benefit the whole of society.He said he was angered by claims that tackling climate change was against the poor, while acknowledging that a failure to benefit everyone carried risks. “If we are not able to show that it is done in a fair way more and more people will say no, we will give food to extremist parties, who will try to demonstrate that this is only a plan for Tesla-driving tofu eaters.“But the real victims of the climate crisis will be the poorest people in society. They have no other place to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed638ca33eb218e485d9b517c133ea928acd9c74/0_95_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59ee68a0542b734b1c338b8eff2c8e10","title":"tropical forests losing their ability to absorb carbon study finds","story":"Amazon could turn into source of CO2 in atmosphere by next decade, research suggests Tropical forests are taking up less carbon dioxide from the air, reducing their ability to act as “carbon sinks” and bringing closer the prospect of accelerating climate breakdown.The Amazon could turn into a source of carbon in the atmosphere, instead of one of the biggest absorbers of the gas, as soon as the next decade, owing to the damage caused by loggers and farming interests and the impacts of the climate crisis, new research has found.If that happens, climate breakdown is likely to become much more severe in its impacts, and the world will have to cut down much faster on carbon-producing activities to counteract the loss of the carbon sinks.“We’ve found that one of the most worrying impacts of climate change has already begun,” said Simon Lewis, professor in the school of geography at Leeds University, one of the senior authors of the research. “This is decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.”For the last three decades, the amount of carbon absorbed by the world’s intact tropical forests has fallen, according to the study from nearly 100 scientific institutions. They are now taking up a third less carbon than they did in the 1990s, owing to the impacts of higher temperatures, droughts and deforestation. That downward trend is likely to continue, as forests come under increasing threat from climate change and exploitation. The typical tropical forest may become a carbon source by the 2060s, according to Lewis.“Humans have been lucky so far, as tropical forests are mopping up lots of our pollution, but they can’t keep doing that indefinitely,” he told the . “We need to curb fossil fuel emissions before the global carbon cycle starts working against us. The time for action is now.”At this year’s UN climate talks, known as Cop26 and to be held in Glasgow in November, many countries are expected to come forward with plans to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But some rich countries and many companies plan to reduce their emissions via offsetting, often by preserving, replanting or growing new forest.This research shows that relying on tropical forests is unlikely to be enough to offset large-scale emissions. “There is a lot of talk about offsetting, but the reality is that every country and every sector needs to reach zero emissions, with any small amount of residual emissions needing to be removed from the atmosphere,” said Lewis. “The use of forests as an offset is largely a marketing tool for companies to try to continue with business as usual.”The difference is about the same as a decade of fossil fuel emissions from the UK, Germany, France and Canada put together.Climate scientists have long feared the existence of “tipping points” in the climate system, which when passed will condemn the world to runaway global heating. There are many known feedback mechanisms: for instance, the melting of Arctic ice leaves more of the sea uncovered, and, as it is darker than the reflective ice, it absorbs more heat, thus leading to more melting.These feedback mechanisms have the potential to accelerate the climate crisis far ahead of what current projections suggest. If forests start to become sources of carbon rather than absorbers of it, that would be a powerful positive feedback leading to much greater warming that would be hard to stop.Forests lose their ability to absorb carbon as trees die and dry out from drought and higher temperatures, but the loss of forest area from logging, burning and other forms of exploitation is also a leading factor in the loss of carbon sinks.Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab, who was not involved with the research, told the : “This analysis provides concerning evidence that, along with continuing deforestation rates, the carbon sequestration rate of tropical forests could also be threatened by increasing tree mortality under climate change. This is very important information, as the capacity of tropical forests to capture anthropogenic carbon emissions could be severely impaired.”The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, tracked 300,000 trees over 30 years, providing the first large-scale evidence of the decline in carbon uptake by the world’s tropical forests. The researchers combined data from two large research networks of forest observations in Africa and the Amazon, as well as years spent travelling to remote field sites, including a week spent in a dug-out canoe to reach Salonga national park in the troubled Democratic Republic of the Congo.They used aluminium nails to tag inidual trees, measuring the diameter and estimating the height of every tree within 565 patches of forest, and returning every few years to repeat the process. This enabled them to calculate the carbon stored in the trees that survived and those that died. They found that the Amazon sink started weakening first, but that African forests are now rapidly following. Amazonian forests are exposed to higher temperatures, faster temperature increases, and more frequent and severe droughts, than African forests.Their projection that the Amazonian forest will turn into a carbon source in the mid-2030s is based on their observations and a statistical model and trends in emissions, temperature and rainfall to forecast changes in how forests will store carbon up to 2040.Doug Parr, the chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said governments should heed the science and make strong commitments to cut greenhouse gases at the Cop26 summit, and agree to measures to protect and restore forests. “For years, we have had scientific warnings about tipping points in the Earth system and they’ve been largely ignored by policy and decision-makers,” he said. “That forests are now seemingly losing the ability to absorb pollution is alarming. What more of a wake-up call do we need?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0148736565372c1dd4bbf6a5eec46e3ab51b328e/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d495258303ddd0a053370741c20b96d0","title":"it made the oscars fun sandy powell signature suit goes on show before auction","story":"Costume designer Sandy Powell is selling suit to raise funds to save Derek Jarman’s cottageIt has been signed by more than 200 stars including Billie Eilish, Leonardo DiCaprio and Joaquin Phoenix, and even inspired the Hollywood actor Laura Dern to plan a trip to the windswept shore of Dungeness in Kent when she is next in Britain.Now the cream calico suit worn during the awards season by the Oscar-winning British costume designer Sandy Powell is to be auctioned in an attempt to raise money to save Prospect Cottage, the Dungeness home and garden of the late Derek Jarman.“It ended up being much more successful and fun than I ever imagined it to be,” Powell said of the autographs during a private viewing of the suit on Wednesday.The designer, who was nominated this year for Bafta, Oscar and Critics’ Choice awards for her work on The Irishman, attended parties armed with a permanent marker and her “blank canvas” suit. Billy Porter, Janelle Monáe, Daniel Kaluuya, Adam Driver, Spike Lee, Renée Zellweger, Bong Joon-ho, Elton John and Saoirse Ronan are among the stars and luminaries to have signed the suit’s arms, legs and pockets.“A lot of people didn’t know who Derek was and they looked it up and expressed an interest,” Powell said, adding that Dern in particular “went away, looked on the website” and would now be one of the tourist visitors to the barren Kent headland.Jarman bought and moved into the Dungeness cottage in 1986 and turned it into an artwork in its own right. After his death in 1994, it was cared for and maintained by his long-time companion Keith Collins, who died in 2018.Powell has described how some parts of the suit were less signature-friendly than others. Richard E Grant had to kneel down on the red carpet to add his name, while Gwendoline Christie found herself signing Powell’s inner leg. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are on the lapel, Kylie Minogue peeps out of a pocket, and Donatella Versace opted for the back.It “made going to the Baftas, going to the Oscars – I know it sounds really blasé, but actually it’s really boring a lot of the time – really fun and gave a purpose”, Powell said.She described the project as deeply personal – she credits Jarman with giving her a start in the industry and said he was the biggest influence on her career.Tilda Swinton, a longtime friend and collaborator of Jarman’s, who was one of those to first approach Art Fund for their help, was also present at the private viewing to add her signature.“Of course what we dream of is that some incredibly inspired and inspiring and enlightened rich person will buy this suit and give it to some museum,” Swinton half-joked. “It’s really important to remember that Derek was all about process, he was not really about things.” The money raised will also go to fund an artistic programme of residencies. “We were the lucky babies who got to do it with Derek,” said Swinton, “and we visualise so many more lucky babies out there who can plug into the battery as well.”The suit is being auctioned by Phillips auction house and will be on display at the front reception of Phillips Berkeley Square in London until the end of the auction at 5pm on 11 March.

For that reason. I’m going to err on the plainer side of things, and, like Larousse, go for strong bread flour, rather than ordinary, or Koffmann’s soft cake flour, to help on the open crumb front (Koffmann specifies French T45 , but that proves thin on the ground amidst the jumble of spelt and brown rice varieties in my local supermarket).Pic and Leiths use milk rather than water in their doughs, but I don’t think it makes much difference to flavour or texture the principal taste, before soaking, ought be that of butter and just a hint of salt, which stops the end product from being overwhelmingly sweet.As a descendant of the kugelhof, it makes sense that babas would originally have been much larger than the inidual portions common today. Many of the recipes suggest they can also be made in a bigger mould, and I take Leiths up on this by baking its version in a decorative bundt tin. Though it looks impressive, I would caution against doing the same, for the simple reason that it’s much harder to immerse such a thing fully in syrup, so it runs the risk of being rather dry.You can flavour the cakes with citrus zest, as Leiths does, but more common, if controversial, is the addition of dried fruit, usually soaked in rum – Willan chooses currants, Larousse raisins. Such things, as any ice-cream aficionado can attest, pair extremely well with rum, but to my mind, they add too much to the overall sweetness of this dish if I were going to gild this particular lily with anything, it would involve a contrasting flavour, such as sour cherries or bitter candied peel ... but I’m not, because I like the simplicity of the dish without them. If you have a particular yearning for fruit, I’d recommend serving it alongside in the form of fresh berries, or indeed the candied pineapple Koffmann favours.This need be no more than sugar and water, but I think it’s sensible to make it quite strong, because reducing it risks the mixture becoming too thick for the babas to absorb. Though none of the recipes I try suggests it, I’m going to make mine with brown, rather than white sugar, because I think the flavour works well with the rum.Strangely, most are also silent on the specifics of the booze – surely the defining characteristic of this dessert – with only a couple calling for dark rum. I do try it with golden rum, too (the blander white stuff seems a waste of time if that’s all you have, be generous with it), but if you’re buying a bottle especially, the strong molasses note of the dark kind makes it our preference.For a really punchy finish, instead of adding the rum to the syrup, sprinkle it over the finished cakes, as both Larousse and Leiths recommend just don’t let anyone drive afterwards.Pic infuses her syrup with vanilla, Koffmann adds orange and lemon peel, too, while Willan rather intriguingly goes for coriander seeds, which ide the crowd. A mixture of orange and vanilla proves more popular, but you could use cinnamon, star anise, cardamom or just about any spice that takes your fancy.The recipes employ a variety of techniques to get this syrup into the babas, from painting it on to the cake straight from the oven (Leiths) to adding the babas to a boiling pan (Larousse). But the most successful is Pic’s: she immerses them in cold syrup and leaves them to soak, which cuts out the slightly faffy step of tenderly turning them over and over until you judge they’ve absorbed the maximum amount of liquid.Koffmann observes that “Babas need to be very moist … and the best way to guarantee this is to bake the cakes several days in advance and leave them to harden and go slightly stale. Like stale bread, you’ll find that they’ll be desperate to soak up the liquid.” It’s true – if you have the time, make them up to a week ahead.Serving suggestions in the recipes I try include Pic’s chestnut sauce and vanilla cream, and Koffmann’s chantilly, but I’m not sure you need more than simple whipped cream, a shot of rum – and some fresh fruit, if you must.It is best to make these in medium savarin or ring moulds, though you can get by with small dariole basins or even fairy cake tins.Prep 20 min plus proving and soaking Cook 20 minServes 44g dried yeast3 tsp demerara sugar75g butter, plus extra to grease 200g strong bread flour1 tsp fine salt2 eggs, beatenFor the syrup400g demerara sugar 1 vanilla pod, split 200ml dark rumPut the yeast in a bowl with 75ml warm water and a pinch of the sugar, stir to combine. then leave until bubbly on top. Meanwhile, melt the butter and set aside, then whisk the flour, salt and remaining sugar in a large bowl or food mixer.Mix in the yeast and half the egg, followed by the rest of the egg. Once throughly combined, gradually beat in the butter until you have a smooth batter.Grease the moulds thoroughly with butter, and ide the batter between them, filling each hole no more than half full. Leave in a non-draughty place until the batter rises nearly to fill the moulds.While the babas are proving, and if you’re planning to serve them imminently, make the syrup. Heat the sugar in 500ml water, then addthe vanilla pod and its seeds. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then, once it comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and set aside to cool. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. When the syrup is cool, add the rum. Bake the babas for 20-25 minutes, until golden, then leave to cool on a wire rack. Leave for several days, if possible, then immerse in the syrup and leave for two hours, turning occasionally. Drain and serve with the extra syrup in a jug on the side.• Rum babas: deserving of revival, or a dessert best left in the past?

In Moscow, given the chance to attend the Bolshoi Theatre he preferred to go to the British Embassy for a screening of an Alf Garnett film. He was not somebody who held any truck for continental sophistication. And yet his greatest lesson came from the Hungarians.Ramsey was at right-back in November 1953 when the Hungary of Ferenc Puskás, Nándor Hidekuti, József Bozsik et al demolished England 6-3 at Wembley. It was the moment at which English football finally woke up: the modern game might have been codified in England and disseminated around the world by British teachers, sailors, bankers and industrialists, but England could no longer claim to be pre-eminent. On a foggy afternoon at Wembley, the myth of English superiority was irrevocably destroyed.What followed was a period of radical change. A shape and a style of play that had essentially been unaltered for quarter of a century was dismantled. Traditional English wing-play, the apogee of which had come just six months before the humiliation against Hungary as Stanley Matthews inspired Blackpool to a dramatic 4-3 victory over Bolton in the FA Cup final, was phased out. W-M became 4-2-4 became 4-3-3.Ramsey, having spent much of his career under Arthur Rowe, the architect of the push-and-run style that helped Tottenham to the title in 1951 and somebody with enough in common with the Hungarian game that he gave a series of lectures there, was perhaps predisposed to questioning the status quo. As Ipswich manager, withdrawing the left-winger Jimmy Leadbitter and winning an implausible league title in 1962, he was at the forefront of the avant garde.By the time Ramsey led England to glory at the 1966 World Cup, he had withdrawn both wingers and developed an early form of 4-4-2. He would never have acknowledged it, perhaps wouldn’t even have admitted it to himself, but the trigger for the revolution that brought England the World Cup was defeat to Hungary.England weren’t the only nation to benefit from the lessons of Hungary. Directly or indirectly, every World Cup winner since Uruguay in 1930 has been in some way shaped by the great blossoming of footballing thought that occurred in Budapest in the years immediately after the First World War and the diaspora that followed. But as the rest of the world continued to adapt, English football remained broadly insular, as though satisfied that the winning formula it had found would remain permanently applicable.But some teams did evolve, most notably Liverpool, whose dominance of the late 70s and early 80s was at least in part rooted in a switch to a more patient approach after Bill Shankly’s side suffered a pair of uncomfortable defeats to a tactically intelligent Red Star Belgrade in the 1973-74 European Cup. “The Europeans showed that building from the back is the only way to play,” Shankly explained. “It started in Europe and we adapted it into our game at Liverpool where our system had always been a collective one … We realised at Liverpool that you can’t score a goal every time you get the ball. And we learned this from Europe.”By the end of the decade, English teams weren’t just learning the lessons of European teams, they were signing European players. The Dutchmen Arnold Mühren and Frans Thijssen were integral to Ipswich’s success under Bobby Robson. Perhaps more would have arrived had it not been for the 1985 Heysel ban, but by 1992, when the Premier League began, there were only 13 players from outside Britain and Ireland.That rapidly changed. The increasing financial clout of English clubs coupled with the Bosman ruling allowed English clubs to entice major foreign stars: Eric Cantona, Jürgen Klinsmann, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Bergkamp, Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli. And with them began the Premier League’s growth to become the major global league. Each brought their own ideas, their own way of doing things and that, inevitably, began to change the mentality and approach of the British players working and training alongside them.But the greatest influence was a manager. It was Arsène Wenger who dragged English football into its new age with such cunning ruses as improved nutrition, a targeted counterattack and a detailed knowledge of overseas transfer markets. They seem basic strategies now but at the time they were revolutionary by the time Wenger finally left Arsenal in 2018 his problem was that everybody else had caught up. His innovations by then came as standard.After the disappointment of Jozef Vengloš’s brief reign at Aston Villa, Wenger was proof that European ideas could thrive in English football. Gérard Houllier, Rafa Benítez, José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Roberto Mancini soon followed. The Premier League became less an English league than a world league played in England, the majority of its best managers Europeans.And so we reach the modern age, and the great clash between Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, a meeting of two schools of football, one Dutch filtered through Spain, the other characteristically German although with its origins in the Soviet Union. Other than Alex Ferguson, Kenny Dalglish and Manuel Pellegrini, every manager who has won the Premier League has been continental European. The worldwide popularity of the Premier League is to a large degree down to the marriage of the British obsession with pace, effort and physicality to subtler external ideas about positioning, shape and tempo.And this perhaps is the lesson of inter-war Budapest. After the British had brought football, why did the city prove so fecund? In part it was a combination of rapid urbanisation leaving vacant lots (the grunds) that proved ideal training grounds for kids, and writers and intellectuals in the coffee-houses debating football, developing for the first time tactical theories. And the spread of those ideas came about because the economic and political turmoil of the time led to great exodus of the gifted. But it was also because Budapest was a vibrant melting pot of ideas, cultures and ethnicities.English football now is a sporting equivalent. It no longer seems outrageous to see Marcelo Bielsa on the touchline at Barnsley or Phillip Cocu at Northampton. The foreign influence is everywhere. Has the influx of foreign players slowed the development of young English players? Perhaps, but that’s at least as much a product of the richer clubs stockpiling young talent and not playing them. When they do break through, the facilities could hardly be better or the environment more challenging.English football’s only international triumph stemmed from a defeat to Hungary that proved local ideas had become outmoded. English football’s most internationally successful club side, was profoundly shaped by defeat to a Yugoslav team. Its step into modernity was led by a Frenchman. Innovation and development are driven by the interplay of ideas. At the moment, the Premier League, for all its inequalities and flaws, is truly international, a place where erse theories can clash against each other and be tested and refined.If that changes as a result of Brexit, if the European influence is diminished, the consequences for the future can only be damaging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f076567a2befa3a73594b104ae65d4b1d5318b5/0_48_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25de1b14d0b5c59149a16415153706d","title":"italys serie a considering matches behind closed doors due to coronavirus","story":"The Italian government has confirmed that all sporting events must be staged behind closed doors until 3 April, affecting England’s Six Nations matches against Italy in Rome and all Serie A games, after the country’s death toll from the coronavirus passed 100 people.There was no immedate confirmation from rugby union authorities about whether either of England’s men and women’s matches on 14 and 15 March will go ahead but the announcement means 20,000 England supporters will now not be making the trip unless the games are postponed until a later date.That remained a possibility on Wednesday night, with Six Nations organisers yet to make a decision on whether to play the matches behind closed doors. ITV is reported to have decided not to send a commentary team to Rome, even if the men’s game goes ahead, with the broadcast to be based in London instead.Schools and universities throughout Italy have also been closed until 15 March after a further 28 people died on Wednesday from the outbreak, with the government decree concerning sports events later ratified by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte . It means all sporting fixtures are suspended for 30 days and can be staged only behind closed doors if in “closed structures”, with all events due to take place in northern Italy’s red zones cancelled.“Sports events and competitions of all kinds and disciplines, held in every place, both public and private, are suspended however it is permitted to carry out the aforementioned events and competitions behind closed doors, or outdoors without the presence of the public,” read the decree. “In all such cases, the associations and sports clubs, by means of their medical staff, are required to carry out the appropriate checks to contain the risk of spreading the Covid-19 virus among athletes, technicians, managers and all accompanying persons who participate.”Italian football has already been strongly affected by the impact of coronavirus, with a growing number of postponed matches that include the Coppa Italia semi-finalsthis week. So far 10 Serie A matches have been postponed, as well as the two Coppa games between Juventus and Milan and Napoli v Inter. In cycling the Strade Bianche, Milan-San Remo and Tirreno-Adriatico all appear in difficulty after teams began asking to drop out.Mitchelton Scott said it would “withdraw its teams from the next period of racing” including all three Italian races.“We, as team doctors and the wider team, have a duty of care to protect health and wellbeing of all our riders and staff,” the team said, citing an inability to influence measures taken to preserve athlete health as a reason for their decision. “We will not have any input into, or control over, the measures that race organisers may or may not put in place to manage the Covid-19 risks.”The American men’s team EF Pro Cycling have also written to the Union Cycliste Internationale asking to withdraw from all three races, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal. The Dutch women’s team Parkhotel Valkenburg will not be taking part in the Strade Bianche. This week RSC Sport, the organiser of all three Italian races, had insisted they would go ahead.Several cycling teams remain under forced quarantine in an Abu Dhabi hotel. Members of the French teams Cofidis and Groupama-FDJ as well as the Russian collective Gazprom, including 18 riders, have been confined to the fourth floor of the Crowne Plaza since last Thursday.The United Arab Emirates health ministry said on Tuesday that six new cases relating to the cycling event had been discovered. They were identified as Russian, Italian, German and Colombian nationals but it was not clear if they had been confined to their hotels.In a statment FDJ said: “All of our riders and staff in the UAE have been tested negative for Covid-19. Still several positive results – not involving our team – have been reported inside our hotel.”Away from the immediate effects officials have been striking more confident notes about the prospects for the Olympic Games this summer. The International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, spoke bluntly on the subject following the second day of the IOC’s annual meeting in Lausanne.“I can tell you that today … neither the word ‘cancellation’, nor the word ‘postponement’ was even mentioned,” Bach said. “Of course we are a responsible organisation and this is why we have a joint task force, which is having regular meetings, but we are not speculating on any kind of future developments.”Bach’s remarks were echoed by the head of the British Olympic Association, Andy Anson, who told BBC Sport: “It is not affecting our plans in any way, in that we are absolutely focused on getting the team to Tokyo for the Olympics in July and everyone is obsessed with that, that is the number one focus.“At the same time we are getting information from all the relevant bodies, so we have got the most up to date information on coronavirus, and it is changing every day as you can see with the news stories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c20586d7c02cae80bcb49dee4052864a951ff10/102_72_3238_1943/master/3238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ad07e1b7c2d27754b0ff311ccaa690","title":"leicester city birmingham city fa cup fifth round match report","story":"The FA Cup can so often be seen by bigger clubs as a distraction but for Leicester this run could hardly have come at a better time. Ricardo Pereira’s goal eight minutes from time allowed Brendan Rodgers’ side, flagging in the Premier League since the turn of the year, to tilt their sights towards glory once again as they reached the quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.Qualifying for the Champions League via a top-four finish remains a realistic priority. But after a run of three wins from 15 league games, this hard-earned victory offers Leicester a fillip as they seek to regain their joie de vivre.With Jamie Vardy, without a goal in his last eight games anyway, still sidelined with a calf injury, Leicester dominated this Midlands match-up against a hard-working and well-organised Birmingham side, but without making too many clear chances.Then just as extra-time beckoned, Ben Chilwell crossed from the left towards Kelechi Iheanacho at the far post. The ball fell out to Marc Albrighton who, at the second attempt, manipulated enough space to clip in a cross that Pereira – what was the right-back doing up there? – leapt to head in his fifth goal of the season. It all added up to Birmingham’s first defeat in 14 games and their supporters left the East Midlands proud of their team’s efforts.Demarai Gray had been recalled to the starting line-up for the first time since Leicester last won, in the previous round of the Cup at Brentford during January.It was also the first time that the former England Under-21 winger had played against his first club and Rodgers was clearly hoping that the occasion might provide an extra spring in the step of the Birmingham-born 23-year-old, whose career has rather stalled since he left for Leicester just over four years ago.Jude Bellingham has been the Championship player on everyone’s lips this season and, amid speculation of intensified interest from Borussia Dortmund, the 16-year-old was again rested by Pep Clotet. A club source said before kick-off that there had been no contact from the German club.From the off Gray looked in sprightly form on the left wing for Leicester who, seeking to rediscover their pre-Christmas form, only made three changes from the side that lost to Norwich on Friday. They still have an eight-point buffer from fifth place in their pursuit of a return to the Champions League, but the Cup represented a clear invitation to ginger up their season.Ben Chilwell, delightfully and almost instinctively found on the overlap by James Maddison, had a cross-shot deflected just wide of the far post as Leicester had a flurry of early chances.But the best opening of the half was engineered by Kerim Mrabti in a thrilling counter-attack. The Swede slalomed through from his own half before an exchange of passes invited Scott Hogan to lay the ball back for Mrabti to attempt a shot that was charged down.Leicester dominated possession, unsurprisingly, and Maddison jinked his way down the left of the penalty area shortly before half-time after combining with Chilwell and Gray. Cutting back on to his right foot, the playmaker’s swerved shot was punched out by Lee Camp.The home side attempted to play with greater tempo after the interval, and Maddison became even more pivotal to their play. After Jonny Evans stretched his neck to head over a difficult chance from Albrighton’s clipped cross, Rodgers introduced Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes, making Birmingham’s task all the more challenging.They kept a compact shape, transitioned from side to side in well-organised fashion, and did not allow Leicester anything for free. When Maddison did gain a clear sight of goal, albeit from 25 yards, his shot deflected off a Birmingham defender and against the top of the crossbar, with Camp beaten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5416b45a8762485adb18fbae47530247011548d6/0_153_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a0ac0a6294b35d01390f06dee6883c","title":"roll up roll up for the premier league hall of fame oh and let the arguments begin","story":"These days we call it ‘engagement’ or ‘interaction’ – but make no mistake this latest piece of off-pitch drama is designed to make football fans madA lot of the tech giants tell you they’re investing so heavily in driverless cars because they want to save lives. And you know, that’s so close to the truth – but it’s not quite it. In fact, they’re investing so heavily in driverless cars because they want to capture ever more of your behavioural data, and that’s much easier to do when you’re interacting with their products instead of driving a car. Be in a car, by all means – but ideally you will soon be interacting with their products in that car, as opposed to driving it. Or to put it another way: these guys don’t want to save lives! They want to ruin them a bit more! (I’m kidding, of course. We’re only at the very beginning of understanding all the great stuff this type of technology has done for us.)It’s hard not to see the same relentless altruism in the Premier League, who seem to be making yet further investment in the idea of football-less football. As discussed here a few weeks ago, the sheer volume of content generated about the league’s first winter break showed how much less essential football itself is becoming to the “product”, while football-adjacent content – off-pitch drama, social media engagement, sponsorship culture and so on – performs better and better all the time.Against this backdrop, then, the announcement of a Premier League Hall of Fame met with the expected reception. Which is to say: vast interaction, in the form of vast derision. But as we know, the type of interaction seems to be largely irrelevant these days. Only last week, as has been much noted, Manchester United’s managing director Richard Arnold was announcing smugly that the loan signing of Odion Ighalo was the top trend worldwide on Twitter. It’s an interesting metric of success, though by no means one we should discount. As I type this, the top two trending topics on UK Twitter are Peter Andre and Liz Truss – both of whom would arguably be similarly impressive signings for Arnold, who has yet to alight on one Official Derision Partner of Manchester United.But before we go on, a quick recap on the Premier League’s big idea. At this stage, there do not appear to be plans to make the Premier League Hall of Fame a physical facility, like the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. This is sadly not a museum of Premier League history, which could make space for such priceless cultural artefacts as the Chateau Petrus-soaked napkin on which Richard Scudamore once scribbled “Game 39???”, or the air rifle Ashley Cole shot the work experience kid with.Instead, according to the official portentous press release on the matter, being inducted will come with a medal and will be “the highest inidual honour awarded to players by the League”. Think of this as the Victoria Cross, with any medal a player might have got for actually winning the Premier League hereby immediately downgraded to the equivalent of a mere mention in dispatches. The first two inductees will be announced in two weeks’ time, with the gazillions of fans inevitably enraged by the choice invited to get involved and vote for others to join them. Yup, classic Premier League. They’ve got us right where they want us.We also learned that the Hall of Fame is to be “presented by Budweiser”, whatever that means, whose global vice president of marketing says: “We are passionate about football, and so are our consumers.” And he might be right. They certainly aren’t passionate about beer, that’s for sure.Anyway, that’s about the size of the plan. On the one hand, I quite enjoy the first big idea of new Premier League chief Richard Masters being a best-of-the-best initiative. As a man who was famously something like the seventh choice for his role, this marks him out as a keen ironist.On the other hand, what is the point of any of this stuff but the endless, ferociously pointless online rows it generates? We don’t call them that, of course – it is “engagement”, or “interaction”, or “loyalty”. Inspired by the Eskimos of cliché, we now have 100 different words for calling someone wrong on the internet. Great swathes of modern life and culture are now governed by a series of euphemistic abstract nouns for what is – let’s face it – the business of getting people to spend hours furiously insulting each other online. Or as Masters prefers to sanitise it: “It will be an occasion for our fans around the world to look back over the years and help us celebrate some truly exceptional playing careers.”It will also be an occasion for a lot of newspaper articles – like this one, in fact – that can’t leave well alone. After all, this is how they get you. At the weekend I read a column stating that this Hall of Fame devalues the worthy Hall of Fame that already exists at the National Football Museum in Manchester – a column which then immediately proceeded to devalue the latter Hall of Fame by demanding to know why Terry Butcher wasn’t the crowning glory of it. “Surely nobody can disagree,” this stated, “that he should bestride the Hall of Fame, a bloody bandage round his head.” “If it helps,” I immediately began replying sarcastically to the pixels on my phone, “I can totally disagree?”On that day, I managed to find the strength to delete this wildly unnecessary interjection before I posted it – but now I’ve fallen right off the wagon and written this. That’s the siren-song of football-less football for you: only the truly pure and the truly strong fail to get sucked in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89fccc6db7b3cbc1c05fb8b91d47fd843d8d808/0_111_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b5d61164d0b5a23f3ec5391c07b2d0","title":"sheffield wednesday manchester city fa cup fifth round match report","story":"For the umpteenth time in his glittering Manchester City career Sergio Agüero ensured the tale of this tie had a happy ending for the holders. His second-half winner took them into the quarter-finals and secured the striker a remarkable 254th goal for the club.This puts City’s record goalscorer one ahead of Wayne Rooney’s all-time mark for Manchester United – in five fewer years – and is a 23rd of another standout season, the most in all competitions by any Premier League player. City were given a trip to Newcastle United in the draw held here after the final whistle.“The important thing is that we are there,” said Pep Guardiola. “This is our fourth game away in a row and we have another one at Old Trafford.”Guardiola made six changes from Sunday’s XI that secured the Carabao Cup, though a team including Agüero, David Silva and Rodri remained formidable. This was particularly true for a Sheffield Wednesday that had won only once in their past eight outings, Garry Monk’s side sitting in 12th in the Championship, eight points from a play-off position. The manager selected the 24-year-old Joe Wildsmith in goal for his first appearance since August 2018.Hillsborough was far from full, perhaps in protest at Wednesday’s poor form. A pity as Monk’s men took the contest to their visitors when possible - a burst from Jacob Murphy drawing a foul due to an Otamendi bodycheck.City are relentless, of course. As the match moved towards the half-hour mark the familiar sight of the ball being relayed in and around Wednesday had them moving from their territory to near goal. Riyad Mahrez was set up and really should not have blasted over.Neither should Julian Börner have headed out for a City corner when the safety of Wildsmith’s hands beckoned. He will have been relieved neither this nor a second corner that followed from the opposite left quadrant did not presage his team conceding.A further scare came when Mahrez floated in a free-kick and Otamendi beat Wildsmith with a deft header but not the bar. City were moving closer though Agüero could still miscontrol a standard ball in to him, and Stones later had to scurry to clear close to Claudio Bravo’s area. Missing was the devilish invention and spark of a high-end City display. As the interval approached Guardiola may have prepared instructions for his side to up concentration and tempo in the second half.So far there had been only the odd threat to Wildsmith’s goal: a concern for Guardiola but not for Monk, who saw Stones’s stooping header bounce over just before the whistle for the break. A quickfire Bernardo Silva cross and Agüero shot immediately following half-time suggested Guardiola had reminded his side they are defending this trophy. But when the No 10 was caught offside moments later the manager threw his hands in a frustration that was threatening to become the tale of his team’s evening.The sense was heightened when David Silva rolled the ball to Benjamin Mendy and Wildsmith’s fingertips pushed the ball on to the bar. Now, though, the left-back turned creator, threading a pass to Agüero for the marksman to break the deadlock, a pivot and shot that beat Wildsmith despite the keeper getting something on this.From here the expectation was for City to strangle the contest with keep-ball play, while adding to the score. And though Otamendi had to be sharp to head an interception when Fernando Forestieri looked to run clear from halfway, those in the yellow and orange shirts did now toy with Wednesday. If this was an unwanted kind of vindication for the sparse home support – announced as 20,900 – Stones would have doubled the lead if not for Wildsmith’s reflexes.A sweeping sequence that took Mendy along the left and came close to setting up Agüero – again – was City in smooth gear. Stones falling into Bravo’s goal as Steven Fletcher threatened to equalise was not. This had Wednesday fans raising the roof and Guardiola’s men in frantic mode. But it did not last and when Raheem Sterling came on for Agüero this was hardly encouragement for Monk’s men.The manager had time to give his star centre-forward a quick lecture. “He says when Riyad or Bernardo receives the ball just to move in behind the centre backs,” Agüero said. “He is focused on that. It is fine, he’s fine. Always a good manager and crazy.”Monk said: “We understood how hard it was going to be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de48c24a4d199828a84c284c94c2c851b5aa22c/37_199_2631_1579/master/2631.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36ff0d2def525056958f51bc018b7971","title":"sheffield wednesday v manchester city fa cup fifth round live draw quarter finals","story":"The holders eased past Sheffield Wednesday, while Tottenham’s wait to reach a first final since 1991 goes on.We had to wait a while, but we were rewarded with some drama at the end.

Before that, here’s Jamie Jackson’s verdict on Manchester City’s win over Sheffield Wednesday.Pep’s version of events. “We didn’t concede one shot on target. We were incredibly solid. It was tough, they had ten players there. It was a tough week for us, but the players were ready to fight. We knew if we conceded a lot of chances we would be in trouble. That means a lot. We are playing with more and more quality.”… made by Martin Keown and Chris Waddle.Elsewhere, Leicester have beaten Birmingham 1-0. The Foxes continue to hunt for their first-ever FA Cup. The Spurs-Norwich tie has ended 1-1 and is now in extra time. More on that when we have it.

City weren’t at their best, but they were still far too good for Wednesday. Their margin of victory should have been much larger than one goal they were uncharacteristically wasteful front. But in the FA Cup, a win’s a win’s a win, as Riyad Mahrez explains: “It was tough, we knew it was going to be tough. Sometimes you have to take the win like this, and we are happy to go through. We had to pass the ball between the lines and move a bit. But we knew we would create chances. We scored and we are happy. There is still a long way to go in the FA Cup, but we will try to win every game.”The holders are through, despite missing several chances, Sergio Aguero their hero yet again. Wednesday’s 85-year wait for their fourth FA Cup will go on.90 min +2: Mahrez, Sterling and Jesus stream towards the Wednesday goal. Someone should score, it’s three on one, but they try to walk the ball into the net. Eventually Sterling slams his shot straight at Wildsmith. This should be over. It nearly is, but not quite.90 min: There will be three minutes of stoppage time.88 min: Mahrez is booked for a saucy tug on Murphy, who was threatening to break down the right. One for the team.87 min: Nothing comes of City’s corner. Elsewhere, Leicester have taken the lead late on against Birmingham, Ricardo Pereira scoring on 82 minutes, while Norwich have equalised at Spurs, Josip Drmic for the Canaries on 78 minutes.86 min: Before the corner can be taken, Aguero is replaced by Raheem Sterling. As the striker leaves the pitch, he becomes the recipient of some industrial advice from his manager. Pep’s not happy with his team’s performance.85 min: Mahrez drifts down the left and chips into the mixer. The cross is too high for Jesus, allowing Lees to head out for a corner. Aguero was behind the Wednesday defender, waiting to slot home.84 min: On the touchline, Pep is apoplectic. His charges, perhaps wary of what awaits them should they ship an equaliser, respond accordingly, re-establishing a semblance of control.82 min: City are suddenly rocking a little! Bravo overplays with the ball at his feet, and is nearly stripped of possession by Da Cruz. The goalie shanks out for a corner. Bannan’s delivery is no good, but City are under a bit of pressure for the first time tonight. The cost of not putting away your chances.81 min: A Wednesday free kick, out on the right, is hooked to the far post. Stones misses his header ... but so does Lees behind him. Goal kick, but that was half a chance.80 min: Bannan sends Fox off down the left. His cross is too long. Jesus should clear, but dallies on the ball, allowing Hunt to claim and curl a fantastic low cross along the corridor of uncertainty. Fletcher, at the far stick, is inches away from poking home, but can’t stretch enough. So close to an equaliser that would, on the balance of play, be utterly absurd.78 min: ... David Silva shins hysterically into the stand behind. It’s City’s 19th attempt on goal tonight, and the highest flyer of them all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b31eb729deb35a97d19963fb45ffca82df4dd16/0_2_8280_4969/master/8280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9942a0e0fee24a4d1d2c46d27ff57691","title":"10 smart home devices to get the best out of your amazon echo","story":"Improve your domestic life with these Alexa-enabled productsAccording to research by PwC, it’s predicted that the UK will spend an incredible £10.8bn on smart-home technology in 2019.

We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddf1f62130f6cde7a879a721a3d2f98bed2fb92/295_206_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8291b075e33f5895f543aed0b290c8","title":"can alexa help lower my screen time while keeping me connected","story":"With an Amazon Echo Dot at hand,  Alim Kheraj learns to break free of social media bad habitsI used to feel quite superior because of how little I relied on the tiny gods in our pockets – the devices that require so much time and devotion from everyone else. Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I’d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.I was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I’d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.When the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening – seduced by the allure of shiny new technology – I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.Conscious that the Echo wasn’t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine – a set of Alexa’s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to “start my day”. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the ’s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.It was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it’s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.Diving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the  skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears’s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute’s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.My phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.Not only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn’t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn’t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.Most notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn’t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.It’s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it’s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you’re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I’ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8adbafa13df3beb1dd61f6ff187e3532556d439/0_0_6246_3748/master/6246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7be414563553090e2390b09460f795","title":"so i got an amazon echo but can alexa get my life together","story":"Looking to streamline his life, writer Phil Samba bought an Amazon Echo Dot to see if the smart speaker could provide some assistance … Like every millennial, I’m obsessed with self improvement. Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

But they do not always have the cheapest price available – and their best efforts to provide that may, in fact, serve to push up prices across the web.The problem is compounded by the fact that the largest online travel agents also enforce rate-parity clauses, which ban hotels from offering cheaper rates anywhere else online. But those clauses do not cover other avenues of inquiry, including email, phone calls or in-person visits, opening up the prospect of savings for canny travellers.“Customers shouldn’t be duped into thinking they’re getting the best price from a hotel booking site when more often than not, they can get a better deal by avoiding its commission and booking directly with the hotel,” said Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel.“Hotel booking sites might be a good place to start your search, but you should always call or email the hotel for the best chance of getting the cheapest deal – even in cases where they can’t offer a better price, there’s a good chance they’ll throw in a freebie or two.”In a statement, Booking said its site “is a much more cost-effective platform for properties to advertise, allowing them to pay only when they generate actual business”.In 2019, the Competition and Markets Authority concluded a years-long investigation into the online hotel booking industry and the largest sites voluntarily committed to ending a number of misleading practices – for instance, falsely implying that hotel rooms were discounted or that multiple potential travellers were looking at the same room and dates simultaneously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29f60e0797d4a49dd28db8001e2a89effea72cf4/0_144_6600_3960/master/6600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=169e5a153dffb39f46e3049f2797fd5a","title":"weatherwatch europe records one of its mildest winters","story":"Germany and Austria had their second warmest winter, while in France it was the hottest since 1900Climatological winter came to an end last weekend and it was an exceptionally mild and wet winter across north-western parts of Europe.

Otherwise, she risked losing her chance to die with dignity. In order to meet the Canadian regulations for medical assistance in dying, known as Maid, Bell had to die before she became any sicker.This, she believed, was wrong, as she explained on camera. “This is my last activist ...” she said into the camera and paused, searching for the perfect word. She smiled when it came to her. “… Offering.”Bell had been diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease 16 months earlier. She had watched her mother die from the same disease decades before. Near the end, her mother couldn’t recognize a table, chairs or her own daughter, Bell recalled. During those visits, Bell told herself that she did not want her family and friends to endure the stress of caring for her if she ever developed Alzheimer’s.“I remember how awful it was to see the deterioration of this woman who lost everything, every part of her ultimately except her shell,” she said.Bell first noticed something amiss when she was 82 years old. She’d lose her line of thought while reading, “and reading was one of my, since childhood, my favourite things to do”, she said. She was taking university courses in writing and philosophy at the time, and dropped them because she couldn’t concentrate.She saw a doctor who gave her the diagnosis: Alzheimer’s disease, early stage.Bell, who lived alone, saw herself changing in the months after her diagnosis. She got physically lost going shopping and mentally lost during conversations. She grew frustrated when she could not find the perfect word or figure out her way through a problem.Solving problems was her job: she’d been a lifelong activist who had advocated for breaking down barriers to women in the workplace since the 1970s. “I never marched or burned my bra,” she said, but “my concern about the status of women in society was a very key one. I tried everything I could to have an impact on that.” She marched in gay pride parades long before most politicians dared to, dyeing her hair purple in support of the LGBTQ+ community.A single mother of three, Bell put herself through university at night while working full-time. She went to become a high-ranking civil servant, overseeing more than 700 employees in the province’s health commission. After retiring, she was wooed back to work for a year, a job she did partly pro bono, to help a not-for-profit organization that supports women and at-risk pregnant teens.Other people might be more easygoing about fumbling for the right word but Bell was not, she said. She was becoming uncharacteristically emotional and found herself weeping in public. “This is thwarting me … one loss piles on top of another loss, and until it gets to the point where, being a human being of my nature and type, there’s scarcely anything left in it,” she said. “I don’t know how best to explain that.”She recognized that her disease was worsening and, in May 2019, she made the choice to apply for an assisted death before she lost her independence.The problem, as she saw it, is that Canada’s Maid law currently only covers people who have the capacity to give informed consent on the day of their death, so a person with advanced Alzheimer’s is unlikely to qualify. What’s more, it is impossible with a disease like Alzheimer’s to predict when a person will lose their capacity to consent. The rate of change can be unpredictable – often, an event like a fall or an infection can suddenly speed up decline.She weighed the decision privately before she set a date. She feared making the wrong choice – of waiting too long and missing out on the chance to have medical help in dying, or dying too early and missing out on time with those she loved, including her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.In the video, Bell is razor-sharp, logical and unemotional. She speaks in sentences of complex structure – contrary to the commonly held stereotype of a person with Alzheimer’s. When she laughs, she throws her head back with delight. But for most of the two hours, she delivers her message with sobriety, arguing that the more than 500,000 Canadians with Alzheimer’s and other dementias should be able to make advanced requests for medical assistance in dying.“If I had been able to do an advanced request, I would not have had to decide to make that decision to die now,” said Bell. “I have been forced to decide now because I fear that at some future time, I will not be able to request it due to the compromise in my brain being much more severe.”You can hear her explain how sure she was:In 2016, the Canadian government passed a law allowing medical assistance in dying. Nurse practitioners or physicians can assess a person’s eligibility for Maid and carry out the procedure, and it is covered by the country’s publicly funded health system.But there are restrictions. To be eligible, a person must meet certain criteria: they must be candidates for health services funded by a government within Canada they must be at least 18 years old and capable of making decisions about their health. They must have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”. The request must be voluntary, and the person requesting it must be informed of all the means available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care.And, finally, they must give informed consent at least twice: first, on the day they are assessed for eligibility and again, after a minimum 10-day waiting period, on the day they receive Maid. To give informed consent, a person must have “capacity” – a medical concept demonstrated by skills involving memory, judgment and decision-making.Many supporters of Maid in Canada feel the law is too restrictive. They want to see an end to the requirement for informed consent on the day of death. They want the law changed so a person could make an advanced request for Maid – a modification called Audrey’s Amendment, named for Audrey Parker, a Halifax woman who opted to die earlier than she planned because she worried her cognition was beginning to falter, as a result of her incurable cancer.“In cases like Leila’s and Audrey’s, and a number of other cases across the country that we know about, people are fearful that they will lose capacity and therefore they get medical assistance in dying early,” said Jim Cowan, a retired Canadian senator and board member for Dying With Dignity Canada.Since Canada’s Maid law came into effect in June 2016, more than 13,000 Canadians have chosen to die peacefully with the help of a physician or nurse practitioner. It is unknown how many more people were assessed and approved but lost capacity before the procedure was performed, said Cowan. “They continue to suffer intolerably, which is bizarre.”Last month, the Trudeau government introduced a bill to make amendments to the legislation, following a public consultation in which more than 300,000 Canadians participated. If passed, the bill would allow advanced waivers for people who are nearing the end of their lives – meaning, under certain conditions, they would not need to give final and informed consent for an assisted death on the day they died. This would achieve Audrey Parker’s dream.But the amendments would not achieve Bell’s wishes. She hoped that people with dementias would be able to write advanced directives setting out the conditions that would trigger their medically assisted death.Bell wanted to wait until she met the criteria for mid-stage Alzheimer’s.“Leila wanted to be able to set out a condition in advance, not a date,” said Townsend.A parliamentary review of Maid is scheduled to begin by June and will consider further amendments to assisted dying in Canada, including eligibility for people with conditions like dementias that could affect their decision-making capacity at some point in the future.Dr Jennifer Gibson, director of the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, called for more discussion about advanced requests in the context of dementia, but she was happy with the direction Canada was moving.“We’re going to need the runway of some time to think about ... how we might be responsive to the interests of persons with dementia who want, like the rest of us without dementia, to be the author of the ends of their own lives,” she said.Informed consent can be difficult for someone struggling with a terminal illness. Cancers tend to follow a general trajectory – the body declines but the mind remains sharp until closer to the end. A person with cancer is an alert witness to their changing body, able to track their own degeneration and make informed decisions about their medical care until closer to the end.Their capacity can deteriorate, and quickly. A combination of disease and medication can wreak havoc with their thought patterns. This is not uncommon in the advanced stages of cancer: patients become drowsy and confused. They forget where they are and what is happening. Even if they have already been approved for Maid, they may be unable to engage with a physician on the day of their planned death to affirm, with certainty, that they understand the stakes, to say this is how and when they choose to end their life.It is different for a person with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer’s. Someone with Alzheimer’s loses their cognitive function progressively, often over years. Their ability to give informed consent can disappear long before their body nears its natural death.It’s that long period of uncertainty, of living without capacity, that Leila Bell feared.For 40 years, Bell supported the right to die with dignity. She longed for assisted dying in Canada before it was legal, as she watched some of the people closest to her die. In 1991, her second husband, Clare, to whom she’d been married for nearly 20 years, died from complications following a heart attack. Leila fell into deep depression and moved in with her best friend, who later died from diabetes. In 2002, Bell’s 49-year-old daughter, Anne, developed an unusual gastrointestinal condition and died, after being cared for by her mother.“I always felt people should have the choice of an assisted death,” Bell said. “We have our own lives to live and we have a right to live those lives in the way we want to as long as we’re not hurting anybody else.”When it was time, Bell sought out Dr Ellen Wiebe, a well-known supporter and practitioner of Maid in Vancouver. Wiebe was the first physician in Canada to perform Maid outside of Quebec. After several appointments, Wiebe told Bell that she was eligible for an assisted death but she’d have to die earlier than she would naturally. Wiebe could see Bell’s capacity deteriorating. “She was at risk within a relatively short time of losing capacity,” said Wiebe.Bell chose a date in late August. She wanted to squeeze in as much time with her family as she could before she died. In June, she flew her two grandchildren to Vancouver. She sat them down and handed them a letter she’d written, explaining her diagnosis and her decision. She wrote that she did not want them to remember her like she remembered her mother in the last stages of Alzheimer’s. They pushed back they said they didn’t see any change in her. They held her letter up as an example of her high level of functioning.Her granddaughter Erin Spence, who has one daughter and is now pregnant with a second child, told her grandmother that she wanted her children to know their great grandmother. She and her brother were not opposed to assisted dying but they could not wrap their minds around the immediacy of her decision.“We just felt like, ‘Why do you do have this now?’” said Spence. “I didn’t notice any difference in her, to be perfectly honest. I really didn’t.”But eventually, Spence and her brother “understood that she had no other choice”.Bell explains how those conversations were difficult for both parties:Bell said she never wavered after her decision, but came up with the idea of recording a video to lobby for change. She paid for the recording of the video and bequeathed it to Dying With Dignity Canada via Townsend.“Leila was extraordinary: independent, stubborn, persistent, an activist,” said Townsend. “But a good death should be available to each ordinary one of us. One shouldn’t have to be extraordinary or lucky to have a good death.”Bell organized a party with her friends four days before she died and a quiet family dinner the night before. She died on 28 August 2019, surrounded by her daughter and her daughter’s partner, Townsend and her partner, and her grandchildren and their spouses.Before she died, Bell thanked everyone in the room for surrounding her with love, “like a warm blanket”.Then, she smiled and winked, and died a few minutes later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f89eb61644095d35db5c8bb8932d6f88c1bfada5/65_138_4233_2540/master/4233.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49c97c71bc7c854a49ee7ad26c472574","title":"perhaps its time to streamline the golf tours says rory mcilroy","story":"Rory McIlroy hopes the threat of a breakaway circuit can be the trigger for a “streamlined” version of existing tours.McIlroy has been extremely candid with his dismissal of the Premier Golf League proposal, which is seeking to coax the world’s best players from the US PGA and European tours. While the notion remains a long shot that it will come to fruition, he has suggested structural change would be a positive outcome.“I know football’s different than golf and all that, but I think being a golf fan these days can get quite exhausting following so many different tournaments, different tours, all that stuff. So maybe streamlining it a bit might be a good place to start a conversation.”Adam Scott, who has been supportive of the PGL plan, has not altered that approach despite McIlroy’s view. “I’m still very positive about the concept of what it could be, for sure,” the world No 7 said. “It doesn’t mean I think it’s going to happen necessarily.“Everyone sees it from somewhat of their own agenda. Being an international player, the thought of a world tour sounds really great. Maybe less so for someone based in Florida who doesn’t have to necessarily travel as much. I don’t think my sentiment has changed at all. I still think it’s fantastic.”McIlroy and Scott are among the leading lights at the Arnold Palmer Invitational this week. Thirteen of the world’s top 25 will tee up at Bay Hill.“What I realised is I can’t make things too big in my head. So if I started to gear up for Augusta in January by the time Augusta got around in April my head would be absolutely fried. So I try to push it out as late as possible. I’ve got four tournaments to play between now and then and my biggest concern and my top priority are those four tournaments.”McIlroy is scheduled to make his Olympic debut in Tokyo this summer, although coronavirus fears mean the Games are shrouded in doubt. “It’s something that we’re trying to stay on top of. If the organisers and the Olympic committee believe it’s safe enough that athletes can go and compete, then you have to take their word for it. They’re obviously liaising with the people that are the best at doing this. If they’re speaking to those people and those people are the best in their field, then you have to trust that their judgment is the right one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc0d93d1fe25bc582f25d65b3a2c69d201e6c774/0_4_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15a89b876d888274d99f4372c6a12da1","title":"allez les standups are french comics gutsier than their british rivals","story":"They’re inspired by Charlie Hebdo and tell jokes that would get British comedians cancelled. Our writer spends a week watching French standupsA plagiarism scandal has swept French standup in recent years, with many of its biggest names being accused of having stolen jokes from their British and American counterparts. Some of the examples – posted online by anonymous whistleblower CopyComic – date from 15 years back, before the internet made the exposure of joke theft far more likely. Big-hitters implicated in the scandal included French-Moroccan superstars Jamel Debbouze and Gad Elmaleh, who are said to have ripped off Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld respectively. Debbouze responded by saying he was inspired by, but did not model himself on, Chappelle while Elmaleh claimed the accusations, while partly true, had been blown out of proportion.It’s a story that is, paradoxically, a gift to comedy. The standup Shirley Souagnon refers to it at the start of her Netflix set, joking that she’s going to be performing Chris Rock jokes, the better to preserve her own material’s shelf life. It’s also a story that shores up our Anglo-Saxon sense of comic superiority. It’s an English-language artform, right? And we Brits are uniquely funny, n’est-ce pas? To many of us, the beginning and end of French standup is probably Eddie Izzard’s famous 1990s routine about “le singe” being “dans l’arbre”.When I began my deep e into French standup, one of the first acts I watched was Tania Dutel – also on Netflix – addressing the new “for women” Bic pens. It seemed to resemble one of the best-loved English-language routines of the last decade, Bridget Christie’s Bic for Her set. Here they go, I thought, at it again! But any sense of Anglo superiority didn’t survive extended contact with French standup. Yes, it’s a younger artform in France: its boom is often dated to the opening of Debbouze’s Jamel Comedy Club in Paris in the mid-00s. In France, the roots of sketch and character comedy, as well as Jacques Tati-style physical humour, run deeper than those of verbal, conversational standup.But – using subtitles and my basic grasp of French – I watched a dozen comics from across la Manche for this article. None of them seemed to be trading in someone else’s material. All had something compelling to say. Dutel – described in the French press as “la standuppeuse qui dynamite les tabous féminins” (no translation required) – is no plagiarist. She’s a post-shame, anti-demure female comic in the Fleabag and Amy Schumer vein, albeit beadier and blanker than either. There’s first-base carnal comedy in her Netflix set, including the routine about smear tests and why she doesn’t like men ejaculating on her back. But she brings a winning dryness to it, and to the life experiences of a thirtysomething singleton whose every boyfriend finds Ms Right, she laments, immediately after dumping her.If the sample available online is representative (and it may not be), there’s no gender bias in French standup. It has some iconic female exponents, including Florence Foresti (playing London’s Hammersmith Apollo this month) and Blanche Gardin, the first female winner of the Molière award for humour. Gardin’s last show, Bonne Nuit, Blanche, was broadcast live from the European theatre in Paris to 337 cinemas nationwide, reaching a total audience of 92,000. And yet, in the English-speaking world, she’s best known as the ex-partner of disgraced US standup Louis CK. How awful, I thought, to discover that your ex-boyfriend did such sordid things. Then I realised that Gardin hooked up with CK after his sexual misconduct came to light.Her love life and her comedy are marching in lock-step, then – because Gardin is renowned (as is France in general) for an ambiguous response to #MeToo. In this, she has no female equivalent in mainstream Anglo comedy where, give or take a few male outriders, the movement has been warmly welcomed.On paper, that might look plain reactionary. On stage, it comes across as more thoughtful – as does Gardin’s twisty routine proposing, from a feminist-historical standpoint, that wives should charge their husbands for sex. It’s arch gadfly-ism, in the Sarah Silverman fashion, performed with a winning stillness and control. Gardin’s personal style (she looks like a time traveller from the 1940s) adds to the frisson.The more French standups you see, the more you realise none of them is trivial. All the acts I watched are social commentators. Of course, there are light-hearted routines – the most famous being Gad Elmaleh’s “Where is Brian?” set-piece. Imagine my surprise to discover that, if you say “Where is Brian?” to a citoyen of France, they’ll instantly reply: “Brian is in the kitchen” – so popular, apparently, is Elmaleh’s riff on English lessons in French schools. “I am traumatised by Brian,” says Elmaleh.Charlie Hebdo is itself an icon of French humour – and it’s noticeable that the country’s standups (unlike their Anglo counterparts) refer to themselves as humoristes, implying a kinship with deployers of funny in other media. Charlie Hebdo is an icon of free speech, too, after the terror attack on its office in 2015. Several of the French standup shows I watched addressed terrorism, specifically the attack on Paris’s Bataclan concert hall, and several more broach the strained racial politics of a country pulled between a burgeoning population of colour and Marine Le Pen’s National Front. That’s another salient feature of French standup, at least as viewed through the Netflix prism: it’s strikingly erse. “Do you know the difference,” Souagnon asks her audience, “between theatre and standup?” Then the lesbian, Franco-Ivorian comic answers her own question: “The colour.”“Politics has always been present in French humour,” says Kader Aoun, the producer who helped set up Jamel Debbouze’s influential comedy club. “But standup brought forward a whole population left out by the system – the poor, uneducated sons and daughters of immigrants.”You just can’t ignore the marginalised voices on France’s standup stage, where French-Africans and French-Arabs anatomise contemporary racial and cultural mores: from the relative status of Senegalese and Moroccan identity (Fadily Camara) the question of whether, if your parents are poor, you are automatically poor too (Jason Brokerss) to the notorious work of French comic Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, who has been convicted of hate speech and censured for Holocaust denial.Then there’s Souagnon’s remarkable routine about the Christian faith of people descended from colonised Africa. Your ancestors were raped in the name of Christianity, she reports telling an audience in Haiti. “Why are you writing ‘Thank you Jesus’ on your taxis? Who writes their rapist’s name on their car?” Ouch. It’s hard to imagine an Anglo standup going near that material – or at least, not as blithely as Souagnon does. But French standups aren’t tiptoeing around 21st-century sensitivities like Brits do. Another rising standup is Fary Lopes, whose parents came from Cape Verde. There are plenty of loose jokes in his Netflix special – about homosexuality, say, and supposedly funny Asian surnames – that would be judged indelicate on this side of the Channel.Yet Fary is no old-school chauvinist. He’s best known for the row he provoked at last year’s prestigious Molière awards when, presenting a prize, he hailed the audience with the greeting “Salut les blancs!” (Hello, white people!) Some hailed him as a speaker of truth to power some, as a racist. Either way, the incident, along with a week’s exposure to French standup, gives a vivid impression of an artform doing what it should be doing: heckling complacency and groupthink, picking the scabs off faultlines in the culture – and making people laugh. Perhaps French comedians started out by copying their British and American counterparts. But it looks like they’re now making standup their own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5ce586750134c80b40be23f4b7807be30775a7d/61_175_2820_1692/master/2820.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4ad4c2b337b3bedfb8a46e3436ed44c","title":"stars in the wings theatres am dram","story":"Box-office fortunes have been built on lampooning amateur dramatics’ cliche and incompetence, yet these theatres have had the last laughA popular idea of am-dram is that the play goes wrong. We love nothing more than a good bit of mayhem and mishap in theatre. Indeed, The Play That Goes Wrong (2015) is a palpable hit, still running in the West End and on Broadway, conceived and performed by three drama school graduates pandering shamelessly to our delight in disaster and misplaced props during a performance of the fictional Murder at Haversham Manor by the equally fictional Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society.The show is an anthology of what we now call Coarse theatre, as famously propounded in Michael Green’s The Art of Coarse Acting. And here’s the thing: Green was a longstanding member of one of the country’s outstanding high-minded amateur companies, the excellent Questors in Ealing. And Henry Lewis, one of the Goes Wrong trio, was a member of Young Questors before going on to drama school.Even at the National Theatre you sit tight whenever an onstage telephone rings, hoping against hope that it will stop ringing when plucked from its cradle even better, of course, if plucked just after it has stopped ringing. It takes a real pro to extract him or herself from a phone disaster, as did Sybil Thorndike when she stepped confidently downstage to answer a rogue phone that should not have rung at that point, picked it up, and turned upstage with an arm outstretched towards Gladys Cooper saying: “It’s for you, dear.”Mishap, telephone-wise, is elevated to sublime comedy in Michael Frayn’s Noises Off (1982), arguably the funniest English play since the war, when Dotty the a, in the role of Mrs Clackett, the housekeeper in the play-within-a-play (Nothing On), gets in a rehearsal tizzy over putting back the phone she’s just answered and leaving the stage with a plate of sardines she’s just come on with. “It’s no good you going on,” she yells at the director at the back of the stalls. “I’ve only got one pair of feet.” The delirium of Noises Off (the first act is set in a rehearsal, the second backstage, the third during a disastrous performance) lies in the deployment of rep cliche and incompetence in the cause of creating iron-cast, clockwork farce ironically, and splendidly, the play is now an am-dram staple.Two years after Noises Off, Alan Ayckbourn created his spirited response to Frayn, A Chorus of Disapproval, which in the original 1985 National Theatre production featured no less than three great male actors who had each first made his mark in am-dram: Michael Gambon as the harassed Welsh director Dafydd ap Llewellyn of the Pendon Amateur Light Operatic Society putting on The Beggar’s Opera Colin Blakely, who succeeded Gambon on the West End transfer in his last ever stage performance and Bob Peck as the bereaved office worker cast as Macheath in the John Gay play (with music), and an unlikely sex god torn between the director’s distraught, unhappy wife and the company’s voracious, married swinger.Gambon, an apprentice engineer, had acquired the confidence to go into the profession by appearing in several productions with the Geoffrey Whitworth Theatre in Crayford, Kent, where he attended the local secondary school, before joining the left-wing amateur Unity Theatre in London, firstly as Buck Mulligan in James Joyce’s Bloomsday.Blakely was a stalwart of his home-town Bangor Drama Club in County Down, Northern Ireland, before turning professional in Belfast. And Peck appeared with amateurs in the Leeds Civic Theatre when he was an art student in the city. This binding of the amateur and the professional stage in the careers of such actors is far more the norm than the exception. The catalyst is often, though not always, Shakespeare, as documented by the scholar Michael Dobson in his Shakespeare and Amateur Performance.Many of our leading actors – sometimes I think almost all of them – have toiled in am-dram, often while holding down proper jobs, and then become notable stars. Leonard Rossiter worked in insurance, and am-dram, for years before turning professional in his late 20s.Freddie Jones left school to work in a home appliances store, then for 10 years as a lab assistant at a chemical factory in Tamworth, while immersing himself in amateur dramatics at the old Shelton Rep and other companies around Stoke-on-Trent he was well into his 30s by the time he trained at Rose Bruford and made his London debut with the RSC in 1962.When Anthony Hopkins and Ian McKellen played in Richard Eyre’s fine television production of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser in 2015, the backstage milieu of the play was supplemented with a BBC online feature recording the stars’ debt to where they started. McKellen mentioned the Bolton Little Theatre. Hopkins said he found himself, by accident, in an amateur dramatics class at his local YMCA in Wales.Ben Kingsley, the son of a doctor, joined his local amateur society, the Salford Players, where he performed while working as a lab technician. He was so “transported” by the thrill of the audience response that he joined a children’s theatre company in London.Glenda Jackson’s first job on leaving school was in a local pharmacy and she got involved in amateur theatre in her home town of Hoylake in Cheshire, “usually playing maids and things like that”.Brenda Blethyn recounted how she worked as a secretary for 10 years before finding her feet with the Euston Players, British Rail’s am-dram group. She even remembers the first line she ever uttered on stage: “It’s a real dirty old night. Evans the post says the mist is right down to the path, quite thick it was.” The more she did, the more she loved doing it, being part of the whole operation of “putting on a show”.She moved with her then husband to Sussex, joined the amateur Chichester Players whose director insisted she take up acting professionally. She applied to, and was accepted by, the Guildford School of Acting in 1972. This is how careers in the theatre often, almost usually, happen. Mind you, I did once ask Toby Jones, Freddie’s son, if he had ever worked in amateur theatre. “Why, does it look as though I have?” was his half-serious, self-deprecating riposte.The story of many even younger prominent actors is incomplete without reference to am-dram. Jude Law’s induction into his profession was no doubt inevitable. His parents, both theatre enthusiasts, met as students at Goldsmith’s College in London and took along their son, and his elder sister, Natasha, now a successful painter and graphic designer, to their local amateur theatre in Eltham, south-east London, in the late 1970s. While mum directed and dad acted, young Jude watched, listened and joined in. He recalls that nobody in the Eltham Little took the work anything but seriously.He was part of the youth group, the New Stagers, for several years, during which time the theatre was renamed (in 1982) the Bob Hope Theatre for the great comedian who was born locally and funded the theatre through his Pro-Am Golf Classic. For Law, am-dram was part of his training which continued when, as a 15-year-old schoolboy at Alleyn’s, he joined the National Youth Music Theatre in 1987. His great friend and contemporary in the NYMT was another future star, Jonny Lee Miller, and they were soon followed by comedian Matt Lucas and such other rising talents as Sheridan Smith and Eddie Redmayne.“It was more than song and dance,” says Law. “I learned almost everything I know about acting, and ensemble work, at the NYMT under Jeremy James Taylor. And when I was asked recently to write about the Bob Hope in my time there, I was literally overcome with emotion at the memory of it all. It all meant a great deal to me, and the level of professionalism in that experience of amateur theatre was as high as anything I’ve subsequently known.” And that might suggest that amateur theatre is not always a mere laughing matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/235d0f8c6fd59934c7532fff3c508400e5d7ab2d/0_0_2656_1593/master/2656.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cce799aa33c6ee068c2f451c878ec3f","title":"coronavirus boosts uk holiday bookings as demand for flights slows","story":"Airlines report slowest traffic growth in a decade, as UK cottages, campsites and glamping companies see surge in early bookings The rise of the staycation is a perennial story.

Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,” said IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac.Nick Wyatt of data and analytics company GlobalData agreed: “Staycations are likely to make travellers feel more comfortable as they are familiar with the location, they can potentially avoid flying, and they know the health service and health structure.”“It appears that staycations are evolving, with a tendency towards more remote settings and standalone accommodation,” said Host Unusual director Alex Wilson. “The key words here are isolation and exclusivity, away from crowds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa83d2f32b1a217a9bdce084af8ba9264d29e01/0_405_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48afd14f2253a0352e2ab0dc0bba0289","title":"do you have a question about podcasts for our critic miranda sawyer","story":"The Observer’s audio critic is here to help find your perfect podcast.

But nothing is certain as counting continues: ‘It’s like a black box’Bernie Sanders was declared the winner in California just moments after polls closed but his final haul of delegates could remain uncertain for days, or even weeks, as election officials tally the millions of provisional votes and mail-in ballots.And while triumph in the Golden State will help Sanders remain competitive in what has become essentially a two-person race between him and Joe Biden, the eventual delegate math could indicate a decidedly shakier path to the nomination than the Vermont senator expected last week.Voting on Super Tuesday in Los Angeles county, the state’s most populous, was marked by chaos after a $300m new voting system resulted in hours-long lines that kept people waiting even as midnight approached. Meanwhile, nearly half the state’s ballots still remain uncounted, estimates Paul Mitchell, with the campaign research firm Political Data Inc, which tracks ballots as they are returned.Many voters dropped off or posted ballots at the last minute, and election officials are required to count mail-ins that arrive as late as Friday, as long as they are postmarked by 3 March.After all the volatility, withdrawals and endorsements leading up Super Tuesday, many California voters said they felt torn as they headed to the polls – and even after they’d voted.Stephenie Smith, 31, told the  she had made a last-minute decision to vote for Warren. “After a lot of conversations, I was kind of leaning toward Bernie,” she said. “I had such mixed feelings.” But on election night, she was worried she’d made the wrong choice. “I like Warren slightly better, but I didn’t want to have split the progressive vote,” she said.Voters who had their hearts set on Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, or other candidates who dropped out before the election were left scrambling as well. Andrew Byrnes, 47, said he settled on Joe Biden, “because I think he’s the most likely to defeat Trump”, he said. “I was torn between him and Warren, but it doesn’t seem like she has a chance of winning.”Traditionally, those late deciders tend to be the types who would favor Sanders, Mitchell said. In California, the Sanders campaign’s early outreach to a dedicated coalition of young, liberal and Latino voters appeared to dull the impact of Biden’s momentum. Exit polls across the country, however, suggested that late deciders tended to side with Biden.As more votes are counted, support for Mike Bloomberg – who is currently in third place – is likely to wane, Mitchell said.Whatever the final numbers, Sanders, who has long dominated in state polls, is sure to retain his strong lead in a state where his progressive politics resonate with a Democratic electorate that skews left, said Erick Schickler, the co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.At an election night watch party in San Francisco’s Mission district, Sanders supporters cheered and clapped as bar TVs blared news of the lefty candidate’s resounding victory.Kyle Schmolze, 30, said he felt “better about progressive politics than I’ve ever felt in my life”. Sanders’ sweep in California was heartening. “It feels like we can actually win,” he said.But his candidate’s losses in the east and south worried Schmolze. “I would feel safer if Bernie had dominated – which is what I had expected,” he said. “I’m feeling all the emotions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0525da8b38f8832932bdf0c1e1d01dcb93409c8b/0_195_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3c519c59a5617cb5102bd2179eb4925","title":"joe biden jim clyburn endorsement super tuesday","story":"Biden won South Carolina – and days later, Super Tuesday – after Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American Democrat in Congress, backed himWhen the House majority whip, Jim Clyburn, endorsed Joe Biden ahead of the South Carolina primary it effectively set off a series of events that resulted in the former vice-president trouncing his rivals in the Super Tuesday primary contests on Tuesday night.Before Clyburn’s endorsement, Biden’s lead in South Carolina had shrunk to single digits. It was an ominous sign for a candidate who underperformed in the first three Democratic primary contests and whose campaign stressed that South Carolina would serve as a firewall.Biden’s ties to the African American community there, who make up the majority of Democratic voters, go back decades and the idea was that those relationships would carry him to victory in the state.But then candidate Tom Steyer, a billionaire, was making an aggressive play to win over black voters in South Carolina. And Bernie Sanders’ aggressive campaign and grassroots supporters in the state were helping the Vermont senator make gains.With just days to go before the 29 February primary, Clyburn hadn’t endorsed anyone and every candidate wanted it. He is the highest-ranking African American Democrat in Congress and an influential figure in his home state of South Carolina.Clyburn, before his eventual endorsement, conceded that Biden’s rivals were gaining ground.“These things usually tighten up when you get close to an election. So, we don’t know. We will find out in about 10 days,” Clyburn said in an interview with CNN.Then came the endorsement.“You cannot overstate the impact of Clyburn on South Carolina Democratic politics,” said Isaac Wright, a Democratic strategist and partner at the Forward Solution Strategy Group. To be sure, Biden’s recent success was not singly due to one endorsement. He had always polled ahead of the rest of the field in South Carolina and he had been methodically picking up endorsements there. But Clyburn’s public backing helped cement Biden’s legitimacy among the Democratic electorate in the 2020 primary.Following Biden’s decisive victory in South Carolina on Saturday, his main moderate rivals within the primary, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, quickly dropped out of the race and endorsed him. Other endorsements, including the coveted backing of former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, Barack Obama’s US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and former candidate Beto O’Rourke, flooded in for Biden.“That substantive victory in South Carolina is what set off a chain reaction in the next few days – the Buttigieg endorsement, the Klobuchar endorsement and what amounts to all but a clean sweep on Super Tuesday,” Wright added.The endorsement came just a few days before the election but Biden’s poll numbers had begun to tick up dramatically and he won the state by about 30 percentage points.“Black voters turned out and they had their voices heard and they are on the trajectory of propelling Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee. Clyburn’s endorsement was part of a flood of good fortune for Biden,” said Eric Goldman, a Democratic consultant.Goldman noted though that Clyburn’s endorsement was just one part of the turnaround. Goldman stressed Biden’s “longstanding” ties to the African American community.That victory seems to have set off a domino effect of support among Democratic voters in southern states and minorities. In the 14 primary contests on Tuesday, Biden won every southern state. According to exit polling Biden’s victories in some of these key states were largely thanks to strong support among minority voters.And on Wednesday, Biden’s remaining moderate rival in the primary, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, dropped out and endorsed him.The Super Tuesday victories for Biden also elevated him back into frontrunner status. He came away from Super Tuesday with more delegates than Sanders and the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.Biden’s turnaround, from a campaign on life support with no victories and dwindling cash to frontrunner, had happened in an eight-day period, with Clyburn’s endorsement marking the beginning of the dramatic change.  A day after Super Tuesday Clyburn, again speaking on CNN, admitted he was surprised with the extent of Biden’s victories the night before.“I was a bit surprised: it did go better than many of us expected,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde0895f512daa6b4f171a17441501199bca88bc/0_106_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27d22e1410743d20b9acb64d4d852057","title":"what else could mike bloomberg campaign 500m have bought","story":"The former New York mayor could have paid off student loans for 150,000 people or bought houses for 2,200 homeless peopleThere wasn’t much good news on Super Tuesday for the more progressive wing of the Democratic party, save for one lesson: money on its own, mercifully, cannot, as of yet, buy an entire election.That’s the lesson many drew from the failure of billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who had hoped spending a half billion sliver of his massive fortune on an ad buy and staffing a national campaign might make inroads against former vice-president Joe Biden for the battle of the centrists.But Bloomberg’s announcement today that he will be dropping out means the more than $500m he spent was wasted on nothing. Unless you count his sole win in American Samoa.Wasted is a relative term of course, because for a man reportedly worth over $60b, $500m to him is practically nothing. For everyone else it’s still, well, $500m, and that has prompted some to wonder what good that kind of money could have done spent elsewhere.Here are some places he might have better spent the cash dump:For around 110 of what he spent on getting embarrassed in front of the world, Bloomberg also could have replaced all of the old lead pipes in Flint, Michigan, then had hundreds of millions left over to pull every citizen there – or in many other cities – out of poverty. It’s a point that many made when the campaign complained about their headquarters there being lightly vandalized last month.While $500m might be a drop in the bucket of the $1.4tn owed in student loan debt in America, with an average outstanding loan of around $37,000, that’s roughly 150,000 people whose lives the former New York City mayor could have transformed for the better. Think about all the good all those people unshackled at once from their predatory student loans might go on to do.With a reported 60,000-80,000 people living unhoused in New York City, his hometown, Bloomberg certainly would have had to lay out a bit more than $500m to give them all homes, certainly in one of the most expensive cities in the country, but with an average home price across the US of about $226,000 that’s well over 2,200 people he could have simply purchased a home for. Just like that. Here’s a house. It’s all yours now. He’d barely even notice the money was gone. As an ardent believer in democracy, Bloomberg is no doubt aggrieved by Florida Republicans’ efforts to reverse engineer a poll tax against the will of the voters, making it harder for felons to vote. Bloomberg could make a huge dent in the hundreds of millions outstanding, restoring the right to vote to thousands, or alternatively, he might have funded any number of campaigns against Republicans in the state actively working to disenfranchise its own citizens. His call, really!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c56699e61ea9e92250fdda9fdf24884584d6b19/0_0_4500_3000/master/4500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22136a19f1cdd4625aebae2782336815 880w","title":"super tuesday 2020 live news bernie sanders joe biden california texas primaries latest updates","story":"Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, told CNN that Joe Biden would be a tough opponent in the election. “I think Joe Biden’s got a good reputation,” said Graham, a Republican senator of South Carolina. “He’d be more moderate than Bernie, but I still think it’s Trump’s to lose.”Biden’s victory in Graham’s home state is what gave the firmer vice president’s flagging campaign the boost and momentum to take on Super Tuesday.Chuck Schumer’s team has responded to Chief Justice John Roberts’ reprimand. In a rare statement, Roberts described a speech that Schumer delivered as the Supreme Court considered a case that could result in grave new abortion restrictions as “threatening”. Schumer had said that the Trump-appointed justices would pay a price for restricting abortion access. “Sen. Schumer’s comments were a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision,” said the senator’s spokesperson Justin Goodman in a statement. “For Justice Roberts to follow the right wing’s deliberate misinterpretation of what Sen. Schumer said, while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsberg last week, shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes.”After his big Super Tuesday wins, Biden just held a very brief press conference at a Los Angeles hotel, making about a dozen supporters and a large crowd of journalists wait over an hour for roughly seven minutes of remarks. He did not speak about Bloomberg’s departure or his remaining rivals in the race, saying:“What we can’t let happen in the next few weeks is let this primary turn into a campaign of negative attacks. The only thing that can do is help Donald Trump ... Donald Trump poses an existential threat to our standing in the world.”“We are going to take this fight all across America to rebuild the middle class,” said Biden, who appeared relatively subdued in the small hotel conference room at the W Los Angeles in Westwood. Biden ignored reporters’ questions as he walked out, but briefly responded to one question about criticisms that he is part of the Democratic “establishment”, saying, “The establishment are all those hard-working middle-class people, those African Americans...”LA mayor Eric Garcetti, a Biden supporter, showed up, but made no remarks.Lulu Lima, an 18-year-old supporter who also stood behind Biden, told me after that her father is a union member and supporter of the candidate. She said she was grateful to cast her first-ever vote for Biden and felt excited about his surge: “It’s awesome to see what can happen ... It means never lose hope, and in a broader sense, never lose hope for this nation.” Asked if she was confident Biden would win, she said, “All we can do is hope.” She said she avoids talking about politics with friends or others her age who are Sanders supporters: “It’s important for iniduals to have their own beliefs.” The president blamed a federal agency decision during Barack Obama’s administration, which Trump said made it harder to quickly roll out testing for the virus. “The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,” he told reporters during a White House meeting with airline executives, whom he had called to discuss the economic effects of the outbreak.“That was a decision we disagreed with,” he said. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason, it was made.”It’s unclear what decision, exactly, Trump is referring to. The Trump administration has been criticized for dismantling an Obama effort to respond to global health emergencies more quickly. The president has also come under fire for not rolling out widespread testing for coronavirus more quickly, and spreading false information about the disease. Bernie Sanders admitted he hadn’t been as successful as he’d hoped at galvanizing youth turnout.“Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? And the answer is no,” he said, speaking at his campaign headquarters in Vermont. “We’re making some progress. But historically younger people do not vote in the kind of numbers that older people vote in. I think that will change in the general election.”He told reporters he was “disappointed” by the Super Tuesday results.“Of course I’m disappointed,” he said. “I would like to win every state by a landslide. It’s not going to happen.”But he emphasized the importance of upcoming races Michigan and other midwestern states, where he and Joe Biden are competing to win over working-class voters — to whom both candidates seem to appeal. “Joe and I are running very different campaigns,” he said. “And my hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have.”Hi, there! It’s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. In a rare statement, Chief Justice John Roberts denounced comments from Senator Chuck Schumer, who spoke at a rally outside the Supreme Court as the court heard oral arguments in a case that could result in new restrictions on abortion access.“Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,” Roberts said. Schumer has said that Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — Trump’s Supreme Court appointees — “won’t know what hit” them if they voted to uphold abortion restrictions. “I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price,” Schumer said.That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours.Here’s where the day stands so far:Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.Who were the two “no” votes on the House’s coronavirus bill? Republican congressmen Ken Buck and Andy Biggs. The conservative lawmakers questioned the need for $8 billion in funding to combat the health threat.However, other House Republicans, including minority leader Kevin McCarthy, said the $2.5 billion originally requested by the White House was “a little low.”The House has passed the $8 billion bill aimed at combatting the spread of coronvirus with a vote of 415 to 2.The bill will now advance to the Senate, where it is also expected to easily pass.The $8 billion of funding laid out in the bill marks a significant increase from the $2.5 billion originally requested by the White House, reflecting escalating concern about the health threat.Some of congressman Matt Gaetz’s House colleagues teased him about wearing a gas mask on to the House floor to vote on the coronvirus bill. The House is preparing to vote on its $8 billion bill aimed at combatting the spread of coronavirus.Congressman Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and one of the president’s closest allies, drew attention to himself by wearing a gas mask on to the House floor as he prepared to vote.The $8 billion package, which marks a significant increase in spending from what the Trump administration originally proposed, is expected to pass the House and advance to the Senate.Here’s a funny addendum to last night’s coverage of the protest that disrupted Joe Biden’s speech in Los Angeles:Symone Sanders, one of the former vice president’s top aides, won Twitter praise after she physically grabbed one of the anti-dairy protesters and dragged her off stage.Sanders responded to the viral video by tweeting this:The top Biden adviser has now provided an update that she has made it to the salon to “restore” the nail:Following a string of losses tied to concerns about coronavirus, US markets surged the day after Joe Biden notched 10 victories in Super Tuesday states.Experts attributed the markets’ rally to investors’ relief about Bernie Sanders’ sinking fortunes in the Democraic presidential primary.If reports of Steve Bullock’s soon-to-be-launched Senate campaign are accurate, it would shift forecasts for the likely outcome of the Montana Senate race:Again, Democrats need to flip four Senate seats (or three seats and the White House) to take control of the chamber.Democratic senator Doug Jones is likely to lose his race in Alabama, given the conservative leanings of the state, so Bullock’s candidacy would give a needed boost to Democratic hopes of taking back the Senate.Steve Bullock, the Montana governor and former Democratic presidential candidate, reportedly intends to run for Senate.The decision marks a reversal for Bullock, who spent months resisting Democratic overtures to challenge Republican incumbent Steve Daines.Bullock, who is barred by term limits from running for re-election this year, has faced one of the most sustained lobbying campaigns of any would-be Senate candidate — a reflection both of his potential as a candidate and how badly Democrats need to put another seat in play.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, flew to visit him in Montana last month. And when Mr. Bullock was in Washington last month for the meeting of the National Governors Association, he also met with former President Barack Obama, as was reported by Politico.Bullock’s candidacy will bolster Democratic hopes of taking back the Senate in November. Democrats need to flip at least three Senate seats to regain the majority, four if they cannot win the White House.As a popular and well-known figure in Montana, Bullock will prove a formidable opponent for Daines, even though Trump is virtually guaranteed to carry the state in the presidential race.Senator Kamala Harris appears open to endorsing one of her former presidential primary rivals.Asked by a CBS News reporter on Capitol Hill whether she intended to endorse, the California senator said, “We’ll see.”Reports emerged in January that Harris, who dropped out of the primary in December, was considering an endorsement of Joe Biden. However, Harris did not wade back into the race before her state’s Super Tuesday primary yesterday.Now that the primary is shaping up to be a two-candidate race between Biden and Bernie Sanders, Harris may be reconsidering her position.Mike Bloomberg’s emotional address thanking supporters after suspending his presidential campaign came as a surprise to reporters who covered Bloomberg’s tenure as mayor of New York.Getting a little emotional, Mike Bloomberg expressed his gratitude to supporters who helped power his short-lived campaign.“No matter what happened, this is the best day of my life, and tomorrow will be even better,” the former New York mayor told the crowd.Bloomberg also invoked the imagery of Paul Revere hanging two lanterns in Boston’s Old North Church to help Americans fighting the Revolutionary War to reflect on keeping hope alive in the country.“We will not allow any president to dim that light,” Bloomberg said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7504b65a5fde3c9dc292c75ff64199818a1644de/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2314e0ea032f99be86d6b54253a1780f","title":"britain is leaving europe the guardian is not","story":"The editor-in-chief explains why the  is deepening its commitment to European voices, issues and peopleToday we are making a renewed and deeper commitment to reporting on every aspect of Europe – the continent, its people, its politics, institutions, economy and culture. is a European news organisation with a close relationship with our large and committed audience in Europe.

But will it help arrest population decline? Nationalised IVF clinics, generous loans for couples who promise to procreate imminently and lifetime income tax exemption for having four or more children. Welcome to Viktor Orbán’s drive to get Hungarian women to breed: “family-friendly Hungary”, in the words of the giant banners that now greet arrivals at Budapest airport.Across Europe, as falling birthrates lead to projections of shrinking populations, policymakers are pondering a question: can we pay people to have more children?Countries with rightwing populist governments have taken the lead in answering with a resounding yes, as boosting fertility dovetails with their anti-migration and “family values” talking points. Nowhere is the campaign to get women to have more children more intense than in Orbán’s Hungary. The country’s fertility rate – the average number of children per woman – reached an all-time low of 1.23 in 2011 and remains well below the level of 2.1 that is required for population levels to remain constant.It follows neatly on from the government’s relentless anti-migration message of the past five years. “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the west to this is migration,” said Orbán in his annual state of the nation address last year. “They want as many migrants to enter as there are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children. Migration for us is surrender.”Newly nationalised IVF clinics will offer free treatment cycles for all women who want them (as long as they are under 40 and not lesbian), and Orbán recently promised to extend the lifetime exemption from income tax to include mothers with three children.Most strikingly of all, various loans offer money upfront, based on a future promise to have children. One of these loans provides 10 million forint (£25,400) to young married couples. Each time a child is born, payments are deferred. If the couple have three children within the requisite timeframe, the loan is written off. If they don’t, they have to pay it back.Bettina, a 32-year-old teaching assistant from the village of Mágocs, in southern Hungary, is planning to take out the “baby-expecting loan” in March. She and her husband, a policeman, already have one child and are planning another. “The loan is brilliant. If it wasn’t for this help then we would have to live with one of our parents, or in terrible conditions,” she said.The couple already have a 1.4 million forint loan, taken out soon after their marriage and contingent on having two children within a six-year timeframe. “We are trying hard for another baby now but as the term approaches it does increase the pressure,” she admitted.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all.

It has long closed, and now there is just an old-people’s home. “Every year at Christmas we give the kids presents and it’s noticeable that the number now is so much less than it was in the nineties,” said László Dicső, the long-standing mayor of Alsómocsolád. In the countryside, the lack of young children is even more starkly felt, as the lower fertility rates are amplified by the migration of people to the cities and abroad.Across Europe, governments have introduced benefits aimed at stimulating population growth. In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice party introduced the 500+ policy in 2016, under which mothers received 500 złoty (£99) per child per month from the second child onwards. Last year it was expanded to include all children.In Russia, a one-off payment of £5,800 to families with two or more children was launched in 2007. In January, Vladimir Putin announced a new package of demographic measures that will cost 400bn roubles (£4.7bn) per year. “Russia’s fate and its historic prospects depend on how many of us there are … it depends on how many children are born in Russian families,” said Putin when announcing the policy. Italy and Greece have also introduced “baby bonuses” for each child.In the western half of Europe, fertility rates dropped gradually over several decades as more women entered the workforce and began to postpone having children. In the post-communist states, the change happened differently. There was a sudden drop in fertility after the collapse of communism, brought on not by the social changes but by economic misery and social collapse. At a time when the future was uncertain, childbearing was postponed and birthrates fell precipitously.Over the next years, as the economies of the post-communist states recovered and grew, the same dynamics that had gradually changed the rates over many years in western Europe kicked in, meaning the rates did not recover.“There has been a change in mentality, maybe it’s a western influence. The young generation that is now 30, they have gone to university and want to start having children much later. This means they will have fewer children,” said Simonics.In central and eastern Europe, the falling birthrates have been exacerbated by large numbers of people moving westward in search of work, combined with minimal inward migration . In Hungary and other populist-led countries, the shrinking populations have been painted in apocalyptic terms of national survival.A set of global population projections released by the UN in 2017 did little to allay fears. The study projected that the combined population of 10 eastern European countries would fall from 292 million then to 218 million in 2100, while during the same period the population of west Africa would grow from 372 million to 1.6 billion.“Europe has become the continent of the empty crib whereas in Asia and Africa they face demographic challenges of the opposite type,” Katalin Novák, Hungary’s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, said at a conference on demography last year organised by the Hungarian government.The conference in Budapest opened with a sand animation video of migrants rushing towards Europe, and was laced with references to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which suggests that shadowy forces want to replace so-called “native” Europeans with outsiders. “There are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population for ideological or other reasons,” Orbán told the conference.Ágoston Mráz, who heads a pro-government thinktank in Budapest, said the pro-children policy was a response to a longstanding conservative fear of national extinction, as well as an ideological statement. “It’s anti-liberal, it’s a sign that we are not a multi-coloured country, we believe that while everyone is free to do what they want, there is a hierarchy, and a family made up of a husband and a wife is at the top,” he said.This focus on “traditional families” has become a cornerstone of the Orbán government. Rightwingers from across the world have travelled to Hungary to discuss and praise the country’s family policy. “Hungarian family policy is worthy of close study,” Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, wrote on Twitter in December.The social conservatism underlying such policies is evidenced by the fact that much of the support is available only to married couples. Non-married heterosexual couples and single women are also eligible for free IVF treatment, but not lesbians, meaning one half of a lesbian couple must pretend to be single and heterosexual if they wish to qualify.In Poland, too, government messaging gives a populist twist to the 500+ policy. “In Germany, billions of euros are spent on support for immigrants, but here these billions of złotys are spent on Polish families,” said the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “This is a revolutionary socio-demographic project, and we are proud of it.”Yet despite all the investment, the jury is still out on whether these policies work. In Hungary, the fertility rate has risen from 1.23 to 1.48, though it is hard to gauge how much of that is down to specific policies. In Poland, a brief spike in births after the introduction of the 500+ policy was not sustained. “You don’t expect a breakthrough in two or three years, it’s going to take at least 10,” said Zoltán Kovács, Orbán’s spokesman.The formula for raising birthrates is a slippery thing, with shelves of academic literature and statistical case studies devoted to the debate. Studies show that poorer families tend to have more children than richer families in any case, meaning that boosting birthrates is about more than financial security.“We regret we don’t have good birth rate, but that only comes if we improve our economic life,” Zoran Zaev, North Macedonia’s prime minister until earlier this year, told the  in a recent interview. His social democratic government cut family support policies for larger families that had been introduced by the previous rightwing nationalist government.“There are good birthrates in countries where there is good social care and well-developed economies. These policies change nothing, it just means we spent a lot of money and told our citizens not to work and wait for money,” he added.Anne Gauthier, a professor of comparative family studies at the University of Groningen, said boosting fertility with government spending “can work under very specific circumstances”. She said the key was continuity of policies over many years, giving people the confidence that the support measures are here to stay. She pointed to France, which despite a recent drop still has one of the highest fertility rates in the EU, as a country that has had a generous and sustainable model.Gauthier praised the Hungarian model for offering a package of different measures rather than simply handing out cash. But it’s very difficult to isolate specific reasons for changes in fertility, and researchers still don’t know what effect particular family policies have on the birthrates.“In Scandinavia we thought they got it right, there was a very comprehensive package, focused on gender equality, that ticks all the boxes, and in the past year fertility is going down. So we are scratching our heads and trying to work out what’s going on,” she said.There is a question of whether more targeted spending would be a better use of government resources. The Polish 500+ policy is not means-tested, nor are most of the Hungarian benefits. Indeed, some of the bigger loans actually benefit wealthier families, as they require proof of employment and minimum income levels.The other problem with these policies is that a focus on numbers, with bonuses for each birth, can put statistics ahead of emotions. The upfront payments in the Hungarian system are of particular concern, putting pressure on women to have children they may no longer want. Couples who take out the loan and then get orced have to pay back the whole amount within 120 days. According to the law, couples who find out they are infertile after taking out the loan are exempted from repayments, though in practice they can still face problems to get the money written off.“It increases dependencies, and if you’re in a bad or abusive relationship you are even less free to leave it if you’re bound together by these loans,” said Dorottya Szikra, of the Centre for Social Sciences in Budapest.Daniel Szalay, from Budapest, recounted how he and his wife had applied for the “baby-expecting” loan last July, when she was already more than seven months pregnant. She then lost the baby. The bank told the couple that as there was no child, they would not get the benefits, even though the law stipulates they should. “It’s so frustrating. After this trauma we suffered, the last thing we expected is to have to go through a never-ending process to prove something with which we have already complied,” he said.For governments who claim national survival is at stake, these inidual traumas are a small price to pay for a potential boost in the birthrate. Funding fertility programmes allows populist governments to tick many boxes: to show they are taking care of families financially, reinforce their focus on “traditional values” and accentuate fears of replacement by migration from abroad if the “native” population continues to shrink.“A good state is where the people are not scared of the future and where the population is rising not due to migration from foreign countries,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, speaking at Orbán’s migration conference. “I don’t wish to scare anyone but we must discuss the issue that we are facing extinction.”• This article was amended on 4 March 2020 because an earlier version said, in relation to the Hungarian system, that couples who take out a “baby-expecting loan” and then find out they are infertile are obliged to repay it. In fact the law is that such couples are exempted from repayments, provided they can prove they only found out about their inability to conceive after taking out the loan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/109f3d0a85faeb7c64166cdde16913ffa4ccda77/724_14_4101_2461/master/4101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33d5d2d868e1f015ceef1f29ab6296ce","title":"construction starts in netherlands on longest cycling bridge in europe","story":"The 800-metre Blauwe Loper will only be accessible to cyclists, pedestrians – and batsConstruction has started in the Netherlands on what will be Europe’s longest bridge for cyclists and pedestrians – stretching over a lake, canal, motorway and nature reserve – to connect a new village to its closest town.The so-called “Blue carpet bridge”, or Blauwe Loper, will be 800 metres long, but there are plans to ultimately extend it to 1km in length. The first phase is scheduled for completion by next Christmas.The bridge will only be accessible to cyclists and pedestrians – and bats. Its LED lighting has been designed to assist the creatures in finding their way from the nearby nature reserve to the Oldambtmeer lake. The bridge will also be painted in “bat-friendly” green.The bridge has been designed to last for at least 80 years despite being made from wood, which was sourced from Gabon in Central Africa.Reinder Lanting, a project leader told the Dagblad van het Noorden, a regional daily: “We think we can stretch it to a kilometre by connecting it to the main street in Blauwestad.“This bridge is not going to rot. That is because it is technically well designed. The wood is not pressed together but has a sort of venting system.”Local dignitaries joined an event to watch the laying of the concrete foundations of the bridge. The Dutch cycling embassy, a government-funded agency, tweeted: “The province of Groningen has started construction on the €6.5m, 800-metre Blauwe Loper … When completed in late 2020, it will be the longest bicycle bridge in Europe.”The Blauwe Loper will surpass Europe’s current longest cyclists’ bridge, which is in Sölvesborg, southern Sweden. The 756-metre bridge extends across Sölvesborg Bay.Both bridges are dwarfed, however, by the Xiamen Bicycle Skyway in China. Developed by the Danish design firm Dissing + Weitling, it is 7.6km long.

Here’s how to stay happy, healthy and productive – even if you’re still in your pyjamasAs coronavirus spreads around the world, more companies are urging their employees to work from home. Sony closed offices in London, Paris and Gdynia, Poland, on Wednesday. Twitter announced this week that it was “strongly encouraging” its 5,000 global workforce not to come into the office. Google’s European headquarters in Dublin are empty as its staff of 8,000 work from home to avoid spreading the virus.But how best to work from home if you’ve never done it before? The experts weigh in.“Engage with the possibility that you might need to work from home now, rather than on day one of having to do it,” suggests Matthew Knight of Leapers, a community that supports the mental health of freelancers and the self-employed. “Make sure you have all the technology you’ll need set up already, so you’re set to go from day one.”If you aren’t in quarantine, try not to spend all day cooped up indoors. “Get out of the house at least once a day,” advises Anna Codrea-Rado, the founder of the Professional Freelancer, a newsletter and community for self-employed workers, and co-host of the Is This Working? podcast. “Even if it’s just going to the shops. You’ll get cabin fever otherwise.”Make sure you are taking proper breaks. “One of the joys of working from home is that you can cook a proper meal,” says Codrea-Rado. If you’re worried that people will think you’re slacking, tell your co-workers that you’re logging off for lunch, to avoid being disturbed.Codrea-Rado encourages you to not work from your sofa, or worse still, your bed. “Have a dedicated place to work, even if it’s just the end of your kitchen table,” she says. “It helps you get in the mind frame of work. If you don’t, it muddies the boundaries between home life and work life – working from your sofa all day and then sitting there watching TV doesn’t feel as relaxing.”But don’t feel you need to put on a suit. “People say don’t work in your pyjamas,” she adds. “But I really disagree with that. The beauty of working from home is that you don’t have to think about the optics of how you’re working, you just have to focus on getting your work done.”Many of the people working from home due to coronavirus will usually work from offices. To make the transition as smooth as possible, Corea-Rado advises managers to establish ground rules. “Set the tone for how the team is going to work from home,” she says. “Schedule regular one-to-one check-ins and explain how and when you’d like people to report back to you.”Although it is tempting to just send an email, Knight advises making the effort to call co-workers or employees whenever you can, particularly if you are a manager, to check in on their mental wellbeing. “Ask them how they are doing and really listen to the answer,” he says.If you’re feeling low, let people know. “Don’t just suffer in silence,” he says. “Let your manager or co-workers know how you’re feeling. Nine times out of 10, sharing how you’re feeling with people really helps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8a36b7ed705b7571fb7c9952c4e7a781600d5a2/0_74_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232a26d0bdd08cad62c29a59c89a646c","title":"coronavirus precautions around europe","story":"Schools and universities are being closed and concerts, conferences and sporting events cancelledBy far the worst European outbreak: more than 3,000 confirmed cases so far and 107 deaths. The virus has spread to all but one of Italy’s 20 regions, with the majority of cases in Lombardy, followed by Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Most Italian regions have under 50 confirmed cases.Having already placed 11 towns in lockdown and closed schools in Emilia-Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy, Veneto and Piedmont, the government will now put more towns in quarantine and close all schools and universities across Italy until mid-March. It is also considering closing cinemas and theatres and banning public events that “entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre”. People have been told to refrain from greeting each other by kissing on the cheek and hugging, to avoid crowded places. Those over 75, over 65 with a health problem, and anyone with respiratory problems have been advised to stay at home. The new guidelines also warn people not to drink from the same cups or bottles as anyone else.The Venice carnival was cut short this weekend and many smaller carnivals have been cancelled. Performances at the La Scala opera house in Milan have been halted, and Milan fashion week was closed to the public. Important trade fairs such as the Milan furniture fair and Bologna’s children’s book fair have been postponed, and all sporting fixtures of any description cancelled in the so-called red zone (the northern regions most affected). Several Serie A football matches have been postponed and future fixtures may be played behind closed doors.A total of 257 confirmed cases and four deaths. Thirteen regions affected. Four main clusters so far: Oise in northern France (64 cases), Haute-Savoie (19 cases) and four villages in the Morbihan in Brittany (12 cases) the fourth relates to a group of tourists who took part in an organised visit to Egypt (11 cases), while five members of the same family caught the virus after attending an evangelical church service at Mulhouse in eastern France.Airport screening is in place for arrivals from affected countries. A dedicated Covid-19 emergency facility is being established in each département. The government has banned all indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people and is considering outdoor events on a case-by-case basis in affected areas, all public meetings have been banned and about 100 schools closed. “Every French woman and man” has been asked to help by washing their hands thoroughly every hour if possible and avoiding cheek-kissing. All available and future FFP2 masks from private and public stocks have been requisitioned by decree.Apart from the cancelled Paris half-marathon and the Paris-Nice bike race, most sporting fixtures are going ahead at present, even international ones involving large numbers of visiting fans (although a Paris Saint Germain-Dortmund Champions League match on 11 March may take place behind closed doors). The Paris book fair has been cancelled and the agriculture fair closed a day early. The Louvre museum, which closed over staff coronavirus concerns, has reopened. Municipal elections on 15 and 22 March are expected to go ahead.A total of 240 confirmed infections. Inidual cases in 15 of the country’s 16 federal states, but the earliest and heaviest hit region is the Heinsberg district in North-Rhine Westphalia, on the border with the Netherlands, with 104 confirmed infections. The majority had already fully recovered and showed no symptoms, the health ministry said on Wednesday.German households have had standing advice for several years now to keep enough food for 10 days, but that has not stopped “hamstering”: shelves have been cleared of tinned foods, pasta, rice and toilet roll. The government disease control and prevention agency, RKI, advised people in high-risk groups to shop only once a week to avoid unnecessary exposure to the virus. Whole-town lockdowns are not yet being considered, though some schools, hospitals and workplaces have been temporarily closed. The focus is on keeping track of travellers inside the country and ensuring easy contact. The export of medical protection gear such as masks and gloves has been banned.A number of large trade fairs have been cancelled including the Leipzig book fair and the ITB tourism fair in Berlin. The Hanover Messe, one of the biggest industry trade fairs in the world, has been postponed until 13-17 July.

It says the general population need not use face masks and warns against all but essential travel to affected countries. People who have done so are asked to watch out for any symptoms for 14 days after returning to Spain.The health ministry has ordered football and basketball matches involving teams from affected countries to be played to empty stadiums and advised that large medical conferences and events should be cancelled to free up health professionals. It also wants anyone thinking of attending Spain’s huge annual rallies to mark International Women’s Day this Sunday to use their common sense and stay home if they suspect they might have the virus.Sweden has 35 confirmed cases, including 10 new infections in the Stockholm area announced on Wednesday, all linked either to contact with people already infected or recent travel to China, Italy, Iran or Germany. The Netherlands has 38 cases, four of whom are being treated in hospital, and most of whom were recently in, or related to someone who was in, northern Italy.Advice in both countries is to adopt the standard hygiene practices described above. Both countries are advising against travel to China’s Hubei province and to avoid non-essential travel to elsewhere in China, and all travel to Iran.

The commissions of both the Commons and the Lords are due to meet on Monday, presenting another chance to discuss the virus.However, some MPs believe any talk of a parliamentary shutdown is premature and would be very difficult to implement.The Labour MP Chris Bryant, a former deputy leader of the Commons, said parliament could be doing much more to safeguard against the spread of Covid-19 before it took such a drastic step.“There are early-days measures they could do tomorrow like toilets with hot water, and it isn’t there. They should be thinking about it. There could be more hand sanitiser,” he said.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Bryant said emergency powers would also need to be voted on every 28 days and that would require MPs to come back to parliament.Another plan being considered is that Easter recess is brought forward in an effort to reduce the rate of transmission, he suggested.Before any such decision was made the leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, would have to become involved. Many in the Palace of Westminster will be looking to his turn at the despatch box on Thursday for more guidance.The leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, Dick Newby, said there were older peers with health issues who were considering not coming into the House of Lords.“At this moment I don’t think they are running to the hills but if there are more cases in London and they rose significantly then perhaps this could happen but I’m not aware of anybody taking that step yet,” said Lord Newby.He said he could not envisage a scenario in which the Lords was shut down but the Commons remained open, adding: “We’re not all geriatric and it will take a lot to persuade me not to come in myself.”A spokesperson for parliament said: “We are monitoring the situation closely and continue to work with the Department for Health and Public Health England.“We have taken a range of precautionary measures including placing information posters across the parliamentary estate encouraging thorough handwashing. We have been reassured by Public Health England that the steps we are taking to reduce the risk of transmission are proportionate and reasonable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db384f3f791a183b01a0af87b430f8d9787db76/0_119_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983807113314eb810514471c3556ced8","title":"israel arab parties make historic gains election support surges","story":"Joint List alliance capitalises on backlash against Netanyahu by taking 15 seats in KnessetArab politicians are set to make historic gains in the Israeli election, taking more seats than ever before and solidifying their position as the third-largest force in the Knesset, the country’s parliament.Boosted by a backlash to racist campaigning by Benjamin Netanyahu, Arab candidates also capitalised on anger towards the prime minister’s ally, Donald Trump. The US president’s recently-released “peace plan” included a highly-controversial clause that could strip some Arab-Israelis of their citizenship.Since the 2015 election, Netanyahu has warned his supporters that the minority could vote en masse to block him from power. Five years later, it appeared they might have succeeded.“We know that the Arabs came to the polling stations in droves,” said the chairman of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, in comments that mockingly mirrored Netanyahu’s derogatory language from 2015. “It was clear to everyone that the Joint List was leading the battle against any rightwing government,” Odeh added.While no Arab party has ever served in an Israeli governing coalition due to ideological differences, any Joint List gains will serve to dampen Netanyahu’s chances of leading the next government. While his Likud party won the most votes of any faction, Netanyahu’s alliance with ultranationalist and religious allies is still short of two or three seats to secure a clear majority.“As far as we are concerned, we’ve already done our part. We’ve stopped Netanyahu’s far-right government,” said Dean Issacharoff, a spokesman for Ayman Odeh.Unless Netanyahu can persuade other opposition politicians to defect, Israel’s political stalemate will almost certainly continue, with the possibility of another complete breakdown and a fourth election.In last April’s election, Arab candidates, including communists, Islamists, secularists and Palestinian nationalists, claimed 10 seats. After they unified into the Joint List alliance in September, they pushed that figure up to 13, promising better services but also to present a bulwark against anti-Arab policies.This time, the Joint List also sought to win votes from progressive Jewish Israelis, some of whom are dismayed with traditionally leftwing Jewish candidates, who have seen their influence plummet as domestic politics lurches rightwards.Meretz, a small Zionist party that opposes the occupation of the Palestinian territories, appeared to have lost voters to the Joint List after it joined forces with the less vocal Labour party. It made the move to risk disappearing from the Knesset altogether, but alienated some supporters.“A lot of leftwing voters were disillusioned or disappointed,” said Issacharoff, adding that the Joint List estimated it had doubled its support from Jewish people. “We’ve never been in a place that is so influential.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ead260dea92ef182b83a6d12954fea37edd0f7/0_228_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d8599669aeeb83244de2da6c54b4ebe","title":"move to weekly uk coronavirus updates criticised by experts","story":"Decisions raises fears public won’t be able to make informed choices to help control outbreakAs Downing Street confirmed that discussions are taking place on contingency plans to close the Houses of Parliament if the outbreak becomes widespread, 36 new UK cases were announced on Wednesday.Three of the cases are believed to have been contracted within the UK, confirming fears that community transmission is already occurring and that attempts to contain the virus have at least partly failed. In total, 87 people have tested positive in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Health officials faced a backlash over a decision not to release information about where new cases are until a weekly roundup announced each Friday.It said the move was a response to the sheer number of new cases. But a former director at the agency urged it to reconsider to allow the public to make informed choices. It came as:Prof Paul Ashford, former north-west regional director of PHE, criticised the decision not to disclose the locations of new coronavirus cases.“They should be sharing the data as much as possible, to make the public equal partners in tackling this and help them make decisions about their own lives. The public needs to know if it’s in their area on a daily basis,” he said. “The planning documents talk a lot about openness, transparency and public involvement. But that hasn’t applied to what’s been going on for the last three weeks.”Dr Jennifer Cole, biological anthropologist at Royal Holloway, University of London, who carried out research into information exchange during the Ebola crisis, said the move risked the spread of fake news.She said: “I think it’s an incredibly ill-advised decision. If it’s not released officially, it creates an information vacuum and it will be filled by unreliable sources … Containment is going to be down to public behaviour and the public response. To not take into account what the public want leaves the government and NHS open to accusations of not being transparent.”Other countries have been more open about the spread of the virus. Singapore identifies the street where cases are confirmed. And in South Korea, phone alerts signify when users come within 100 metres of a confirmed case, based on government data.In the UK, some local authorities confirmed the location of the latest new cases.The chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, said it was unclear whether the three new person-to-person infections were direct or indirect from someone who has recently travelled from abroad. It is known that many had travelled from Italy. Two were diagnosed in Greater Manchester, two in South Ribble, Lancashire, one in Liverpool, and two in Carlisle – including a member of healthcare staff at the Cumberland Infirmary.King’s College London confirmed to the  that an immunobiology student working in an asthma and allergy research department at Guy’s Hospital in London has tested positive. Several other staff have been advised by NHS England to self-isolate.A university spokesperson said the risk of other staff and students having been exposed to the infection had been deemed low but did not confirm whether the department – within the Southwark hospital – dealt directly with patients.Goldsmiths, University of London said a guest visiting one of its halls of residence had tested positive for the virus. It said the visitor is self-isolating as a precaution.And Lyndhurst primary school in south London said it may have to close on Thursday after one of the pupils’ parents tested positive.The Scottish government confirmed two new cases, one in the Grampian area and one in Ayrshire. Two new cases were also announced in Northern Ireland.Whitty said the UK had probably passed the phase of trying to contain the disease, and was now trying to delay it until the summer. “We think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK,” he said.The NASUWT, one of the largest teaching unions in the UK, urged the government to address a surge in incidents of racism and xenophobia in schools linked to coronavirus. The union said it has received increased reports of black and minority ethnic teachers and pupils being subjected to “racist name-calling and intimidation” connected to the Covid-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, the London Book Fair, one of the world’s largest book trade events, was called off and the organisers of the Cheltenham festival, which is due to begin next week, said numbers are expected to be down because of coronavirus fears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e801650cf370f417b5d74289fee1ce212a5add9e/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa799ffc6069f09a76ffe0278d23e866","title":"transparency is needed to reassure uk public as coronavirus spreads","story":"Announcing a plan to offer less data on the UK spread of the virus was probably not smartIn South Korea, those worried about new coronavirus cases can trace the commute and daily movements of infected people before their diagnosis by logging on to an app. In China too, you can track new cases as they are confirmed in real time and find out whether you have been on a flight or in a train with somebody who was later diagnosed.In the UK, however, as confirmed cases jumped by 36 – the biggest surge so far – the Department of Health and Social Care announced on Twitter that it would no longer be tweeting their general locations, let alone their travelling habits, “due to the number of new cases”. Instead, it planned to put out a regional breakdown once a week, it said.It went down badly. Twitter users accused the government of a lack of transparency. Some said they would now be pulling their children out of school because they did not know where the virus was lurking (even though children are rarely infected).In fact, most infections are likely to be indoors in families. You won’t contract the virus from somebody who walks past you in a shopping mall and probably not from the shop assistant either. It takes exposure to somebody’s coughs or speech within a range of about two metres for 15 minutes to get infected. Most people who get ill will be infected by friends and relations.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.In South Korea, the apps and websites that developers have built to track people with the virus – using very detailed, if anonymised, information from the government about their movements – may not have the effect of reassuring the public. One of them, Coronamap.live, has a button labelled: “See whether I am safe.” But most countries now are giving out locations and maps are being drawn – even in the United States, where, according to President Trump, there were initially no cases at all.It remains to be seen whether a weekly roundup will satisfy an increasingly unnerved British public."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957c38b0b846e66415c44f181fc141f3db965fb9/620_1187_2581_1548/master/2581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024192f60fc10ee63e9e9966135f4573","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms infection wuhan china covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 4 March, the global death toll is 3,190, while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. In China there have been 2,981 deaths, and there are 80,270 cases in all. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 5,328 cases. More than 44,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.There have been 51 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. There have been 41 cases of the virus in Australia.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae899b66ca5a4544c8c7fc3549f159248d9f84f/0_360_5906_3544/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068ca47cd0d0d67fa4362bb8920cc554","title":"everest by sohei nishino","story":"Photo-collage by Japanese artist is made from hundreds of prints from foothills to summit"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents.

Photograph: Michael CooperPA WireIreland’s first cluster of coronavirus cases has been confirmed, after a family of four tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening.The group comprises two males and two females, and are in the west of the country. The four people are being cared for in a hospital in the west.The latest positive tests from the National Virus Reference Laboratory bring to six the number of confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic, and nine on the island of Ireland.As with the two previous cases in the Republic, the latest cases are linked to recent travel from northern Italy.Two new cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) in Northern Ireland were confirmed earlier on Wednesday. Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Tonight we can confirm there are now six cases of COVID-19 in Ireland. Contact tracing is underway for these four new cases.” Dr Ronan Glynn, Deputy Chief Medical Officer said: “There is still no evidence of widespread or sustained community transmission in Ireland, as seen in some other EU countries. “While we now have six confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ireland, we continue our containment efforts, central to which is that the public know what to do in the event they have symptoms.” The development has major implications for the current containment strategy being followed by public health officials. The tracing of contacts of all four confirmed cases is likely to begin immediately, but is likely to pose a far greater challenges than in the two inidual cases reported in the Republic up to now.Separately, Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid has warned that the country is facing a potentially unprecedented health situation arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.In a bulletin on Wednesday evening, Paul Reid said the health service, although still in a containment phase , was planning for all eventualities.“From what we are learning, however, as we see how the virus spreads in countries across Europe and in the UK, we are facing a potentially unprecedented situation in this country and across all of our health services. “So we must continue to be vigilant and practise good infection prevention and control measures, to protect ourselves, our patients, and our colleagues.”College students One of two new cases in Northern Ireland is a student from Queen’s University, Belfast who recently returned from northern Italy and who is believed to have been in contact with other students from the college.After the North’s Minister of Health Robin Swann confirmed the two new cases, bringing the number in Northern Ireland to three, Queen’s University said it was working with the North’s Public Health Agency (PHA) to contain the virus.Mr Swann said the two cases were not connected.“One inidual travelled from Northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person elsewhere in the UK who had subsequently tested positive for Covid-19,” he said.“Both patients are adults and are receiving appropriate care. Public Health Agency personnel are working rapidly to identify contacts they may have had, with the aim of preventing further spread,” he added .“I would stress that Northern Ireland remains in containment phase,” said Mr Swann. “As I have said from the beginning it was a matter of when not if we received positive cases here in Northern Ireland.”Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said neither patient had travelled through the Republic. “There are no implications for the Republic of Ireland,” he said.Queen’s confirmed the coronavirus case “within the university”.In a statement, it said: “The university is working with the Public Health Agency to ensure that anyone who has been in contact with the infected inidual is identified and supported to receive medical attention if required, and to take all appropriate steps to contain any further spread of the virus and to protect the welfare of all within the university community and the wider public.“The university remains open and is operating as normal. The university will continue to closely monitor the situation,” it added.Queen’s said it has provided online guidance for staff and students and encouraged them to follow the latest official guidance from the PHA. “The university’s major incident team has been convened and is putting in place the appropriate contingency measures which will be communicated to staff and students when appropriate,” it added.While the Northern Ireland health authorities earlier said they were planning to send Covid-19 patients to England if they required further clinical treatment, Dr McBride said not all such patients would require such care.“We have a regional infectious disease unit here in Northern Ireland and indeed we have other facilities which are able to provide appropriate treatment and care,” he added.“We know that for the vast majority of people it will be a mild to moderate illness and they will get appropriate care based on where the appropriate place is to treat the inidual. Not all cases are being transferred to high-consequence infectious disease units because it is not clinically necessary.”He added that there was no connection between either of these two latest cases and the Northern Ireland woman who tested positive for coronavirus last week. Dr Gerry Waldron of the PHA said the authorities were now working to trace all those the patients were in contact with. He said they were following an “established method of contact tracing” which was applied in the initial Northern Ireland case and was well under way in relation to the latest cases. Those who were in contact with the patients would be given information and advice on what action they needed to take, added Dr Waldron.The first confirmed case in Northern Ireland, revealed last weekend, had travelled from Italy through Dublin Airport to Belfast before testing positive.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192984.1583346700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus no restrictions on public events officials say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dr Tony Holohan, the Department of Health’s chief medical officer,  addresses  a media briefing on Covid-19 (coronavirus)  at the Department of Health in Dublin.

Former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi has been given the all-clear to participate in a public conference at Trinity College Dublin after travelling from a coronavirus-hit region of Italy.Mr Prodi arrived hours before Irish people were cautioned against non-essential travel to parts of Italy to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from Europe’s hardest-hit country.The former president of the European Commission is due to speak at a conference entitled Europe and the Future, which is hosted by the university’s debating society, the College Historical Society, and the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).Organisers assessed whether Mr Prodi’s attendance at the event, which is expected to draw a large attendance, should proceed in light of the travel advisory from Department of Foreign Affairs regarding four regions in Italy.After consulting with Trinity College, the IIEA said it had taken the university’s guidance on the matter and that the event would be proceeding as planned with Mr Prodi speaking.“Trinity College is sticking to Government guidelines. At present, those guidelines do not include any restrictions on Italians travelling to Ireland or moving around the country. For this reason, they have advised there will be no restrictions in place at Trinity today,” said a spokesman for the IIEA.The event is taking place as part of a week-long commemoration marking the 250th anniversary of “the Hist” and was open to members of the public who registered online to attend.Mr Prodi travelled into Dublin on Tuesday afternoon from Bologna, the capital of the Emilia-Romagna area, via Munich in Germany, according to a spokesman for the IIEA.The two cases of coronavirus identified in the Republic of Ireland so far have been iniduals who have returned to the country after travelling to Italy.The Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night advised the Irish public against non-essential travel to the Emilia-Romagna and three other regions in northern Italy badly affected by the virus after the second case was confirmed.“We have been closely monitoring the advice of the HSE and Trinity College’s dedicated coronavirus unit and we have been in continual consultation with the Italian embassy in Dublin,” said the IIEA spokesman.“Following all advice available to use, and in consultation with the Hist and Trinity’s chief medical officer, we decided to continue with the event as foreseen.”Mr Prodi is one of a panel of speakers at the event where Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will deliver the opening address.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe EU and UK could agree a “device” to extend the transition period if talks fail to secure a trade deal by the July 1st deadline, a former European Commission secretary-general has said.David O’Sullivan, an Irish former EU director-general in charge of trade who brokered the bloc’s trade with South Korea, said the UK government could drop its objection to the extension of the transition period from the end of the year if it could be sold politically at home. This could then “buy” both sides “more time to continue the discussions” to resolve issues where agreement has not agreed and avoid another potential “cliff-edge” no-deal scenario on December 31st, Mr O’Sullivan told The .British prime minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit trade talks if negotiations have failed to make progress by June and to focus instead on preparations for the UK’s hard exit from EU economic rules on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK must agree to extend the transition period by July 1st, though the UK government has legislated to prevent this scenario happening.Mr O’Sullivan said that he did not think it possible to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in the nine-month period available and said that an extension of the transition period could be agreed, “which would not be called an extension”.“As a former negotiator I could imagine such a device being possible if both sides felt it worked for them,” he said.“Obviously it would require the UK to feel they could sell this as not being an extension of the transition phase, but I could imagine that it would have benefits for both sides potentially if it is not possible to solve everything or even to solve most things by the end of the year.”The retired Irish civil servant said he was most worried the EU-UK trade talks, which began on Monday, were not starting from “a position of mutual trust and confidence” in the wake of reports saying that the UK were trying to “get around” the ratified Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. “It is very unhelpful. As Irish people, of course we feel particularly aggrieved by that kind of language,” he said.“Stepping back from the emotions of our nationality, I think the rest of the EU will look at this and say, ‘but wait a minute we have a legal document, legally binding by both sides, ratified and suddenly we are told one side is actively considering how to wriggle out of it.’”‘Unprecedented’Mr O’Sullivan, whose last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019, described the EU-UK trade talks as “unprecedented” in that the two sides were moving from a position of total free trade to less free trade.The negotiations were “sort of free trade in reverse” as the discussions were uniquely aimed at finding agreement on the degree of ergence rather than convergence, said Mr O’Sullivan. “Typically, in a situation of free trade negotiations, you are talking about two parties who are relatively far apart or have distance between them and you are trying to narrow that distance and you are trying to converge,” he said. “Here we have perfect convergence which we are trying to turn into imperfect ergence.” Mr O’Sullivan will be speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin and Trinity College’s “Hist” debating society on Wednesday alongside former commission president Romano Prodi, and former European Council president and Belgian prime minister Herman Van Rompuy.

This is to meet additional costs not covered elsewhere in the budget of the Áras and “assists in enabling each president to define his or her presidency”.In a review of the work and scope of the Office of the President of Ireland, published on Wednesday, Áras An Uachtaráin said the total spend of the allowance was €334,748 out of a total allowance for the 14 month period of €370,340, leaving a surplus of €35,592. Mr Higgins has said he will return any unspent allowance to the exchequer at the end of his term.From the allowance €175,226 was spent on food and beverages, €118,573 on hospitality and entertainment and €13,875 on transport, gifts and related costs. The report said 22,307 people visited the property during the period.Furthermore, €13,764 of the allowance was spent on representing Ireland abroad, while books, research, stationary and postage came to €13,310.In terms of Áras An Uachtaráin overall, it came in under budget at €3,565,000, although the figure was up slightly on the €3,499,000 spent in 2018.There was €1.7 million spent on salaries, wages and allowance in 2019, which was unchanged from the year before.

During cyclone Idai in 2019 most parts of the neighbourhood were completely flooded. Photograph: Karel PrinslooUNCDFAFP via GettyIn Beira, central Mozambique, locals sleep looking at the stars. Twelve months have passed, but many still can’t afford to replace what was washed away. Rainy season is coming, and they worry.Wednesday marks a year since Cyclone Idai was discovered off the coast of Mozambique. One of the worst tropical cyclones on record to hit Africa, it made landfall ten days later, devastating parts of the east African country, as well as regions in Malawi and Zimbabwe. Roughly 1,300 people died and millions were affected.Five weeks later, Idai was followed by Cyclone Kenneth, which caused more damage, deaths and displacement.Beira’s mayor, Daviz Mbepo Simango, says the roughly half a million residents of the coastal city are still suffering the impact of what happened. “Most citizens lost their houses, especially the roofs,” he told The .“Windows, doors. We had a lot of flooding. The farmers lost their animals. The question was how to start recovering the city after that disaster. We are trying to do our best, that is what we are working on.”Since the cyclones hit, Simango’s job has focused on raising money. He has been involved in international donor meetings, where “we mentioned some important areas like construction, housing, roads, sewage systems, waste management. At this stage now we have some funds for coastal protection”, he said.An assessment after the cyclones determined that $3.2 billion (€2.87 billion) was needed for reconstruction in Mozambique alone ultimately $1.5 billion was pledged by countries including Ireland. On top of that, $600 million was requested by the UN for humanitarian aid, of which it received about $300 million.VulnerableThese sums highlight the massive cost of climate change.Cyclones were cyclical, she noted, and a big one could easily hit again. “This year we’re experiencing rains in the north and drought in the south. The climate is really a very big enemy for sustainable development in Mozambique. The vulnerability of the people is still very high.”Mozambique is a poor country of about 30 million. There is a worsening Islamist insurgency in the north, while elections in October were marred by violence and allegations of vote rigging.Simango, Beira’s mayor, accuses the government in Maputo of not helping fast enough after Idai hit because Beira is an opposition stronghold. Residents are still terrified about a recurrence, he said.Business is slowly returning to the city, Simango said, though many people still struggle. “We have people who don’t have anything. Some are old, some are children, some are unemployed. People were trying to save money for different interests and now they need to use it to rebuild their houses. People are delaying preparing for their future.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192415.1583335583!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus italy to close cinemas theatres and ban public events","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSouth Korean army soldiers wearing protective gears spray disinfectant as a precaution against Covid-19 at a shopping street in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday. Photograph: APItaly’s government is set to close cinemas and theatres and ban public events countrywide in an attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak, according to a draft decree drawn up on Wednesday.The decree orders “the suspension of events of any nature . . . that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre to be respected.”The draft decree also tells Italians to avoid hugging and shaking hands to prevent as much as possible a further spread of the potentially deadly illness which has been mainly concentrated in the country’s northern regions. Earlier on Wednesday the government decided to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March in a further attempt to contain the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe. The country’s Ansa news agency reported that the government had already shuttered schools and universities in the worst-affected regions in northern Italy some 10 days ago and quarantined a handful of towns at the epicentre of the outbreak. However, the contagion has spread, with at least 79 people dying and more than 2,500 infected. The wider measure, also applying to pre-schools, will come into force on Thursday and could affect up to 8.7 million children and students. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night advised the Irish public against non-essential travel to the Emilia-Romagna and three other regions in northern Italy badly affected by the virus after the State’s second case was confirmed.Japan is enforcing a complete school shutdown that is due to last until April. It was also announced that the Coppa Italia semi-final second leg between soccer sides Napoli and Inter Milan, which was scheduled for Thursday evening, has been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The other semi-final return leg between Juventus and AC Milan, which was due to be played on Wednesday, was postponed on Tuesday evening.Infections accelerate in Iran and S KoreaMeanwhile, Iran and South Korea both reported more than 500 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. With thousands of sick people waiting for hospital beds in Daegu, the South Korean city at the centre of the worst outbreak outside mainland China, the total number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 5,328, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group. Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the Christian sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.“We need special measures in times of emergency,” South Korean prime minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources sent to hot spots like Daegu and economic measures including a $9.8 billion stimulus.“In order to overcome Covid-19 as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources,” he added.The total number of cases across the world has risen to 93,017, with the death toll now at 3,201 people. Iran on Wednesday announced that there had been 586 new cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,922. The total number of associated deaths stands at 92, a day-on-day increase of 15. Tensions over how to contain the spread of coronavirus have escalated in the United States, with the death toll climbing to nine as politicians expressed doubts about the government’s ability to ramp up the speed of testing.What about the United States?All of the deaths have occurred in Washington state, and most were residents of a nursing home in suburban Seattle. The number of cases in the US overall has passed 100 scattered across at least 14 states, with 27 in Washington. In New York state, a second coronavirus case was confirmed in a 50-year-old man with an underlying respiratory illness. He is hospitalised and in a serious condition. New York governor Andrew Cuomo told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the patient had not travelled to countries considered the epicentre of the outbreak, but had visited Miami recently. Because the patient is not believed to have come into contact with other infected people, health officials said it raises concerns that the pathogen is spreading locally.In England, the organisers of the London Book Fair, due to take place from March 10th to 12th, have cancelled the event. They said the fair would return “better than ever” next year. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"uk have cases coronavirus detected","story":"The number of cases of coronavirus in the UK has risen to 87 after 36 new cases were confirmed on Wednesday, March 4.Coronavirus reached Britain in late February and cases are on the rise across all parts of the country.Thousands of people in the UK have been tested for Covid-19, and the government released an emergency action plan to deal with the potential pandemic.It warned up to one in five workers in the UK could be off sick during a coronavirus peak, while the police may switch to only dealing with serious crime. The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK - bringing the total affected to 87.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. The spike comes after 12 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday, including patients in London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester, Humberside and Kent.Public Health England said on Wednesday they will now be releasing information on location of new cases on a weekly basis.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 40 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best coronavirus dry run catastrophic pandemic come","story":"Our naive optimism has left society exposed to potential breakdown when a pestilence runs riotFor a brief period a few years ago, a bizarre, ahistorical, Whiggish optimism descended on much of the Western world. We thought that we had cracked humanity’s challenges, that we had ascended to a superior, final phase in the great story of human civilisations.It was, surely, the end of history: Homo sapiens had evolved into Homo rationabilis at some point in the 1990s, the time of Bill Clinton, Cool Britannia and the Cold War idend. We had mastered progress – scientific, economic, cultural and political. We would live ever-longer, healthier lives, holding hands in a world of almost zero wars, managed free trade, international cooperation and enlightened technocracy, guided by a new meritocratic elite of technologists, economists, lawyers and financiers. The global village would become richer, healthier, more tolerant and more peaceful than anything anybody could ever possibly have dreamt of.Since then, bit by bit, the deluded certainties of a generation used to radical globalisation and technological triumphalism have been shattered by reality, just as pre-First World War naivety was destroyed in the killing fields of the Somme. The coronavirus is merely the latest blow, the ultimate proof that the Four Horsemen have not been conquered and never will be.First, we rediscovered terrorism and the clash of civilisations in September 2001. Then came the realisation of the West’s impotence as the Afghan and Iraq wars failed. Our powerlessness in preventing depression, poverty and economic collapse was all too apparent in 2008. We realised that genocide was still with us in Rwanda and Syria, the tech revolution’s dark side became impossible to ignore, and in 2016 the bells tolled for the technocratic order – the only piece of good news in this long list of body-blows to the utopian dream of 1990s centrists. Now, in 2020, the fear of pandemic has returned. One day, because of Iran or Pakistan or North Korea, we will also rediscover the cataclysmic dangers of weapons of mass destruction.It is unclear just how bad the coronavirus will turn out to be, but we are now in the midst of the third major global scare since 911. The last time so many were so worried was when Northern Rock was going bust. None of the previous big outbreaks – such as Sars, Mers or swine flu – had anything like the same psychological impact in Europe and America.We shouldn’t panic, but we must be realistic. The best-case (and most likely) scenario is that while there may be many tragic deaths, coronavirus is a dry run, a last warning for a worse pandemic that will erupt at some point in the future the worst (and least likely) case is that Covid-19 will end up being comparable to one of the four big epidemics of the past 125 years.The most recent was the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69, which killed 80,000 in the UK. Before that, the Asian flu of 1957-58 took 33,000 British lives, especially children. Then there was the Spanish flu of 1918-19, which cost 228,000 UK lives, and the Russian flu of 1889-90, which killed 132,000.Ordinary flu, which doesn’t panic people because it returns every year, kills 17,000 on average in Britain, ranging from 1,692 deaths in 2018-19, to 28,330 in 2014-15.So how does Covid-19 compare? The debate is all about growth rates: will the current small number of cases continue to rise at a very large rate, or will the numbers tail off sooner rather than later? About 3.4 per cent of reported cases have died globally, including in mismanaged dictatorships such as Iran. If the death rate in Britain were to remain at 2 per cent, and if one million people were to be infected, we can expect 20,000 deaths. If five million catch it, the death toll would hit 100,000. If a fifth of the population is infected, we would be in Spanish flu territory, although Wuhan’s experience suggests it won’t reach anything like those levels.But we need to accept that the Government’s reaction to all of this isn’t excessive. It is proportionate, given current levels of information. Even if the number of fatalities is limited as a result of drastic action, the economic impact could be vast: there will be a massive supply-side shock as public transport systems, schools and companies shut down, supply chains break and companies run out of cash. Airlines are at risk, as are hundreds of thousands of firms, big and small. Workers may not get paid or may be fired, and the self-employed could be hammered. Hopefully, the economy will bounce back, but not if the crisis then extends to the demand-side and the financial system.Spread of coronavirus and SARSThis is not just the Government’s problem. We can all play our part in trying to halt the spread of the epidemic: hygiene and the way we manage social contact are key. The real lesson is that we need to build drastically greater resilience and anti-fragility into all aspects of our society. We worry endlessly about so many overblown threats, but have become entirely unprepared to deal with one of the basic risks. We need institutions that can develop vaccines extremely quickly, push through tests at breakneck speed and mass-produce, all in the space of weeks.Pandemic-proofing needs to become a basic defensive function of every organisation, like cyber-security already is. Firms need to practise working from home households need to be able to self-isolate the Government needs to rehearse plans to shut borders or chunks of the country. Is the current rush to ultra-urbanisation and centralisation of all economic activity in London the right strategy? Would companies be better off with more dispersed centres, even at the cost of some agglomeration effects? Areas where workers commute by car, not public transport, will be more resilient.Crucially, the next virus could be much more lethal: it could easily have a much higher mortality rate, target children as well as the elderly, and inflict drastically greater damage. A 2 or even 3.4 per cent mortality rate is tolerable if not too many people are affected, but what if the next one is even more infectious? What if 10 per cent of patients succumb? Or 20 per cent? The maths is terrifying, and civilisation as we know it could collapse. We must hope the coronavirus is defeated soon, but never again must we fall foul of Panglossian stupidity and assume away the risk of a catastrophic pestilence.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Mr Holmes wanted more than a massage.She began to feel uncomfortable and tried to move away from him. She was prevented from doing so by Mr Holmes grabbing her buttocks and thus holding her in place. That\u0027s between his legs.He asked if he could touch her boobs and he pointed to his groin and asked if she did extras, plainly you may think a reference to her giving him some sort of sexual relief.The lawyer said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was shocked and embarrassed as nothing like that had happened to her in her career before.She went on: Mr Holmes realising that he was not going to get what he wanted, he began to apologise and spent time reassuring and calming her.Ms Strudwick said the peer denies any sexual touching, and read out a statement he gave to police.He said: As I am blind I cannot \u0027see\u0027 - but I can get a sense of what a person looks like through touch, which is the only sense I can use to get an image in my mind of people\u0027s appearance.It is obviously a bit strange to be massaged by someone, without knowing what they look like. By touching I mean lightly tracing the outline of the other person rather than grabbing them in a firm way.As I am basing my recollection only on touch I cannot be sure exactly where my hands rested but there was absolutely no intention to touch her in a sexual way.It was purely to give me an idea of her appearance.I am certain that I did not ask the therapist for \u0027extras\u0027 and am adamant that I did not point to the area of my groin at any time.I did not ask the therapist for sexual services of any kind and I am well aware that those sorts of services are not available in respectable hotel spas, with trained massage therapists.I can completely understand that the therapist may have been confused and upset by my request to touch her as I cannot imagine that she sees very many completely blind clients, who would make a request of this kind.It is always difficult for me and other blind people to ask to touch sighed people, but it is a basic human instinct to want to know what somebody looks like and this is the only way we have.The prosecutor however said his motives were not innocent.Ms Strudwick added: The defence will say that she has made up this allegation. That she is  deliberately lying to gain some benefit, some compensation.The court heard that Holmes did not want to be known by his full title, Lord Holmes of Richmond, at the hearings.The politician, who wore a navy suit and a yellow striped tie, was led into Southwark Crown Court with defence counsel Sarah Forshaw QC and his black Labrador, Nancy.The Conservative life peer won six gold medals at the 1992 Barcelona Games and three at the Atlanta Paralympics in 1996 and broke 35 world records.He was director of Paralympic integration for the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympic Games and took his seat in the House of Lords in 2013.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britons take extreme measures coronavirus panic takes hold","story":"When the Chief Medical Officer addressed a worried nation earlier this week, his message was loud and clear.A major coronavirus outbreak may be on the way - but in the meantime, people should keep calm, and carry on.It appears, however, that the British public may not have been listening.Shop shelves were yesterday emptying of toilet rolls and alcohol as customers began to stockpile for the possible pandemic. Waitrose confirmed it had seen a run on cleaning products and hand sanitisers and was attempting to restock shelves.Contactless card payments were said to be on the rise amid concerns the virus might cling to coins and dirty banknotes.Yoga and gym classes were cancelled, while even the spirit world was affected, with mediums conducting psychic readings over Skype.And across the country, restaurants and hotels reported a worrying downturn in trade as customers stayed at home for fear of catching Covid-19.David Moore, who owns Michelin-starred Pied-a-Terre in central London, told The : We have seen lots of cancellations  for the next couple of weeks, it\u0027s kind of scary. People aren\u0027t coming out. I usually have 12 tables for lunch - today I only had two.To put the minds of his customers at ease, Mr Moore has supplied every table with a bottle of hand gel. But he warned that his restaurant would be in trouble if coronavirus panic truly takes hold. If this continues for a few months like this, we will be gone, he said. I\u0027d say we would have eight to 10 weeks we could muddle through like this. We are going to change our opening hours next week and may have to let some staff go.Patsy Derry, who runs Summer Hill Country House in Cumbria, said: The advance bookings into the year are very thin. There’s nothing, almost nothing. I\u0027v got one or two bookings for September on a particular weekend but all the little mini breaks that people start to have when the weather starts to get a little better won’t be happening.For some sectors, the coronavirus scare has led to a boom in business, however.Black cab drivers are picking up more customers because they prefer to be screened from the driver, it was claimed yesterday.Drivers are reporting an increase in customers switching from private hire vehicles, said Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers\u0027 Association.Passengers are telling drivers they value the protection and like the segregation provided by the cab\u0027s glass partition screen.Meanwhile, hairdressers have been told to wear face masks if it would make customers feel more comfortable.Hilary Hall, Chief Executive of the National Hair and Beauty Federation, said the organisation had been fielding a large number of calls from members looking for advice on dealing with the outbreak.Official advice is that face masks don\u0027t make a difference but it\u0027s more of a case of making clients more comfortable. Some customers are taking their own precautions. Meanwhile, mediums said they were conducting more readings over Skype rather than meeting clients face to face.It\u0027s harder to feel psychic energy through Skype, certainly. But as long as we can see the face, we can do the reading, said a spokeswoman for the Mystery Chest medium service in Harlow, Essex.It\u0027s all about reducing the chances of spreading the virus in whichever way possible. Some customers were said to be favouring contactless payments instead of cash after the World Health Organization warned coins and notes could be spreading the virus.One shopkeeper said on Twitter that he had refused a customer’s banknote after watching her put it near her mouth. She paid with a contactless card instead. Another man was reportedly seen in a Post Office branch in Bishop\u0027s Stortford withdrawing £500 in cash and specifically requesting polymer banknotes as he believed they were more hygienic than paper  notes.However, Ron Delnevo, Executive Director of the ATM Industry Association, cited research from 2018 which found cards carry more bacteria than cash. I think this is all a bit over the top, he said.Amid fears of an outbreak in schools, Brighton College, an independent boarding school in south-east England, announced a new online learning platform for its students in case the school is forced to close.Clearly, the prospect of any school closure is a matter of great concern for those approaching public examinations and for all of our pupils whose education would be disrupted, headmaster Richard Cairns said.We are now confident that we have an appropriate and impressive educational platform that will enable us to offer a meaningful programme of lessons, marking and feedback.Estate agents have reported cancelled viewings and an increase in video tours of homes. Henry Pryor, an independent estate agent, said he was forced to cancel a viewing an hour before it was due to take place because the owner had just returned from Italy with a cold.He added: I am doing more video tours rather than sending clients to see houses. I’ve cancelled all my meetings this week and rescheduled them with Skype or FaceTime.Mark Hayward, chief executive of the National Association of Estate Agents, said some sellers had asked estate agents to check where potential buyers had been on holiday before scheduling a viewing.In an interview, Prof Paul Cosford, Medical Director of Public Health England, said: We\u0027re constantly monitoring what\u0027s happening to see whether we will get more widespread community transmission.I think that it is likely that we will. We\u0027re not there yet, but we must be prepared for that.You\u0027re right that there\u0027s a limit to exactly what we can do. And, of course, it\u0027s very important that we continue with our normal day-to-day lives.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive government accused breach trust stops daily updates","story":"Scientists have accused the Government of creating a “massive breach of trust” after officials said they would no longer be publishing daily updates on the geographical location of new cases.The Department of Health and Social Care said the bulletins would be published on a weekly basis, stressing that the information would still be used in real time to ensure contacts are traced. But last night scientists said the new strategy could undermine public confidence  because it means iniduals would be unable to make informed decisions about whether areas of the country pose a particular risk. See the map below for the current locations of confirmed cases. Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, said: This is a massive breach of trust, I disagree profoundly with this approach.Until now, the Government has done well communicating risks to the public, and they need to keep public trust and confidence. Before I decide to take a journey, I want to know if the place I am going to is a hot spot for coronavirus or not.Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology at the University of Nottingham, said he was surprised by the change of approach. He said: It’s very difficult for people to understand the local risk if they don’t know where these infections are occurring. In terms of people being able to manage their own risk, and therefore help slow the spread of the virus, they need to understand if and when hot spots of infections arise, so they can take measures to protect themselves. We need to understand whether or not these cases are from people who have travelled or visited an area - and so their infection is unsurprising - or whether these are the result of the increased surveillance recently introduced at 100 GPs and eight hospitals. Because if it is the latter, it would suggest there is far more widespread community transmission of the virus and this is really important to understand. If we’re not given that information, or if any social measures are not informed by that information for instance targeted school closures or targeted banning of mass gatherings, then it’s difficult to know how to slow this infection down.In Singapore, which has seen 110 cases, the Ministry of Health has created a dashboard that shares granular data on every case - including their age, the neighbourhood where they live and work and whether the infection was picked up locally or internationally. These updates are shared as and when the cases are detected. South Korea, with 5,621 cases and 35 deaths, has taken a similar approach.  The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a centrally collated webpage with information detailing the regional distribution of cases and details on the connections between patients. The age and gender of those affected is also listed.Germany is continuing to publish regional breakdowns on a daily basis, as is Italy, which now has more than 3,000 cases and 107 deaths. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden soaring super tuesday wins mike bloomberg endorsement","story":"Joe Biden is clear favourite to become the Democratic presidential nominee after winning nine states on Super Tuesday and then securing the endorsement of rival Mike Bloomberg in a remarkable political comeback.The former US vice president proved “Joementum” was real as he swept the South thanks to vast support among African-American voters and even won in states where he had done almost no campaigning.Mr Sanders took three states including his home of Vermont and was projected to pick up a fourth, California, the biggest prize of the night given its vast delegate pot. However he lost Texas to Mr Biden, a state he had a big poll lead in just days earlier. The night crowned a phenomenal turnaround for Mr Biden, who just a fortnight ago had been widely written off by pundits after finishing fourth and fifth in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Exit polls showed people who made their decision in the last few days broke overwhelmingly for Mr Biden, who got a hat-trick of endorsements from former presidential candidates on the eve of voting, with Democrats appearing to prioritise picking a candidate who can beat Donald Trump.Mr Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars after joining the race late, announced his withdrawal on Wednesday after failing to win any of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday, though he did claim victory in American Samoa. “Three months ago, I entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump - because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,” Mr Bloomberg said in a statement. He also endorsed “my friend and a great American” Mr Biden, meaning Mr Bloomberg’s vast campaign, with more than 2,000 employees and 200 field offices, and spending power are likely to be thrown behind the former vice president. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, suffered a poor night, slumping to third in her home state and being pushed into fourth in many others behind Mr Bloomberg. She is considering whether to remain in the race. The results mean that the sprint for the Democratic nomination has become a two-horse race, with Mr Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist pledging “political revolution”, competing with Mr Biden, a 77-year-old moderate who promises a return to the values of Barack Obama, who he served under as Vice President for eight years.Mr Biden has opened up a lead over Mr Sanders in delegates - the metric which will determine the winner - though in California, which has by far the most delegates on offer and where Mr Sanders was winning, counting is on-going. Both men struck a celebratory tone in their results night speeches and declared that the outcome showed why each would go on to win the nomination and take on Mr Trump in the November presidential election. “It’s a good night and it seems to be getting even better,” Mr Biden told cheering supporters at an event on a basketball court in Los Angeles, California. “They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!”He went on: “It’s still early, but things are looking awful, awful good… For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign.”Mr Sanders, speaking in his home state of Vermont, said: “Tonight, I tell you with absolute confidence we\u0027re going to win the Democratic nomination.” But on Wednesday at a press conference he admitted he was “disappointed” by some results and said his campaign had not had as much success as hoped at driving out new voters.Mr Sanders said the race was now a question of “which side are you on” as he criticised Mr Biden for voting for the Iraq War, backing contentious trade agreements, trying to roll back social security programs in the past and having a campaign funded by billionaires. Joe and I have a very different voting record, Joe and I have a very different vision for this country and Joe and I are running very different campaigns,” he said, while accusing the “establishment” of trying “frantically” to defeat him. Mr Biden’s night began by winning Virginia moments after polls closed, kick-starting a dominance in the South as he went on to take North Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas and - in the biggest surprise of the night - Texas. Those victories in traditionally more conservative states were built on massive leads among African-Americans, with Mr Biden often winning more than 60 per cent of votes from that demographic to Mr Sanders’s less than 20 per cent.But Mr Biden also won states where he had not campaigned in before Super Tuesday and barely invested in local advertising such as Massachusetts and Minnesota, proving that the perception of momentum can have more impact than major spending. Mr Sanders’ projected victory in California came in part thanks to overwhelming support among the Latino community, winning half of their votes. As well as Vermont he won the western states of Colorado and Utah. Maine remained too close to call on Wednesday morning.Mr Sanders consistently won big with young voters across America, while older Democrats went for Mr Biden, revealing a major generational ide within the party. Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman still in the race, barely made a dent in voting. Mr Biden’s surge, dubbed the “Biden bounce back” by aides, was triggered by his big win in South Carolina on Saturday and fuelled by a hat-trick of endorsements from former rivals Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O\u0027Rourke on Monday evening. With the path now cleared of other moderates, Mr Biden has an 82 per cent chance of victory according to the betting markets, compared Mr Sanders’s 12 per cent. Mr Trump, reacting to the results, tweeted: “So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prince george princess charlottes school expand surge applications","story":"The school attended by Prince George and Princess Charlotte is planning to expand after an explosion in applications following the royal admissions.Thomas’s Battersea, which charges £19,000 a year as a prep school, plans to open an independent senior school offering places to pupils up to the age of 18.It was thrust into the public spotlight when George, the heir to the throne, joined at the age of four in 2017, followed by his sister, Charlotte, in 2019. Pictures of the young royals arriving with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their respective first days attracted international attention - which is reported to have helped drive admissions up several-fold.The prep school has bought the neighbouring building, home to the Royal Academy of Dance, which it plans to redevelop into one of two campuses for the senior school.It will boast 28 classrooms across 40,000 sq ft and hopes to begin taking admissions from September 2021. The new development raises questions about whether the young royals will stay on to continue their education in London, following reports George was expected to join Eton. An update on the website of the school said: “Opening in September 2021, Thomas’s Battersea Square is a new, co-educational school for students aged 13 to 18 which offers a world-class, progressive education that is forward-thinking and outward-looking”.It added: “We seek to nurture in them a strong set of values, with kindness at the core, which will encourage them to take up positions of responsibility and leadership, to give back to their communities and to make a positive contribution to the world.”The development will bring “substantial refurbishments” to the newly acquired site and will be known as Thomas’s Battersea Square, the announcement said. The senior school will cater for years nine to 13 - pupils aged 13 to 18 - who will be taught at both the Battersea site and a nearby second campus in Putney.Thomas’s Battersea Square will be one of a clutch of new private schools that have appeared across the capital in recent years. telegrapKensington Park School opened its doors to secondary school pupils in September 2018, while the Maida Vale School is due to welcome its first students in September 2020. Both are based in west London. The prep school is held in high regard, with the subjects it teaches said to be “under an impressively rigorous continual review” in an assessment by the Good Schools Guide.The arrival of Prince George at the school, the review said, brought changes including “security measures evident from the front door”, while visitors place their phones in a locker.The Good Schools Guide, which describes itself as offering unbiased and candid school reviews on its website, continued:  “Parents, however, are simply issued with security passes, no-one has to sign a non-disclosure agreement and new parents and pupils are simply spoken to openly about expectations.”Thomas’s Battersea, which teaches around 500 pupils aged four to 11, found itself back in the news when it was forced to close over coronavirus fears. Four pupils were said to have been placed in self-isolation after returning from northern Italy, which has been hit by hundreds of coronavirus cases. The school is seen as a feeder to top public schools across the country along with other day schools run under the Thomas’s name in London, which count Cara Delevigne, the model, and Florence Welch, the singer, among their former pupils. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western forces race against time prepare west african states","story":"Jihadists who have brought bloodshed to the Sahel are advancing rapidly on four previously unaffected states in West Africa, threatening to open a new front in their insurgency.Security officials in the Gulf of Guinea say that under-resourced, under-manned and often ill-prepared armies in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo are involved “in a race against time” to protect their frontiers.All four states border Burkina Faso, where groups affiliated to al Qaeda and Islamic State have launched a bloody and stunningly effective campaign that has swept throughout a country regarded until recently as among the most stable in West Africa.In recent weeks, the jihadists have begun to test the country’s borders with its southern neighbours, raising fears in Western capitals that an already serious crisis is about to evolve into a far broader regional conflagration.Last month suspected militants based in Burkina Faso raided a police station just inside Benin, while a security source in Ghana said that Islamist groups were now carrying out attacks within three miles of Ghanaian territory.“They are steadily pushing south from Burkina Faso,” he said. “It is worrying. We have porous borders and we believe that if the heat is turned up on the jihadists in Burkina Faso they will seek to regroup in Ghana.”Britain is already being drawn ever deeper into the Sahel crisis. It has deployed three heavy-lift Chinook helicopters and nearly 100 personnel to support France’s counterterrorist mission in the Sahel, a vast stretch of arid scrubland on the southern fringe of the Sahara. It will send 250 more to join the UN’s force in Mali in the coming months.But any jihadist infiltration into Ghana would raise pressure on Britain to play a much more decisive role in what has so far been a French-led response to the crisis.The three Sahelian states at the epicentre of the insurgency – Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso – are all former French colonies, as are three of the latter’s four southern neighbours. Until 1957 Ghana was the British colony of the Gold Coast.Just as in the Sahel, none of the Gulf of Guinea states are thought to be anywhere near ready to beat back Islamist groups that have carried out hundreds of attacks on military and civilian targets alike, killing thousands of people a year.Britain has taken a leading role, alongside France, the United States and Israel, in helping Ghana develop a special forces capability, the Ghanaian source said.Last week, British officers also joined Flintlock, an annual Pentagon-sponsored exercise to train 15 African armies in counterterrorism techniques.Given the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Sahel, where the number of attacks has increased five-fold since 2016, this year’s manoeuvres, held in the Senegalese town of Thies and in the desert state of Mauritania, took on an added urgency.For Gulf of Guinea states there is not only terror about what their armies may also soon be facing, but concern, too, that America could be abandoning them to the fight.Even as Britain and France step up their presence in the region, the Trump administration says it is considering substantial cuts to its military presence and ending aid to the France’s Sahelian mission, Operation Barkhane.Whatever happens, Western military trainers at Flintlock say that training and equipping Sahelian armies is vital to winning the battle on the African front of the war on terror. Ultimately, western forces will not be able to leave the region until local armies are strong enough to take the battle to the foe. British officers talk of seeking “to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq”. “The solution is going to be local,” says Brig Gus Fair, commander of the Specialised Infantry Group, a British army unit that trains foreign forces, echoing the mantra repeated by American officers, “African solutions to African problems”.The challenges facing local armies were painfully on display during a training exercise for special forces soldiers from Burkina Faso at Flintlock in Thies last week.Under orders to attack a jihadist camp then capture or kill a pre-identified terrorist commander and recover documents with key intelligence in his office, the soldiers mixed up north and south, captured the wrong man and forgot the intelligence documents.Such mistakes could happen in any training mission in the heat of the moment, even the best British or American soldiers might slip up. But typically such exercises are repeated up to six times. The Burkinabe soldiers got to do it just once, given the time-constraints of the instructors working with so many armies. Amid a growing terror of being overwhelmed, Sahelian states have announced massive army recruitment drives. Given the scale of the slaughter, persuading volunteers is far from easy, however. Instead, some states are increasingly relying on outsourcing the war to ethnic militias – tacitly in Mali’s case, openly in Burkina Faso’s – who have fast established a reputation both for brutality and for carrying out massacres against communities perceived, mostly without basis, as supporting the jihadists.Western officials hope that, should it come to it, Burkina Faso’s neighbours will avoid making similar mistakes. Others worry they may have no choice.The Gulf of Guinea states are supposedly stronger than the Sahel, one of the world’s poorest regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast are West Africa’s second and third richest states, eclipsed only by Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy. Unlike the Sahel, they are also seen as comparatively strong, functioning states.Yet there are also too many similarities for comfort. The northern regions of both Ghana and Ivory Coast are not just more Muslim but far poorer than the remainder of either country.The jihadists exploited similarly marginalised communities in Sahelian states, using local grievances as a highly effective recruiting tool. There are religious differences to exploit too, both within Islam along the ide between Sunnis and Sufis, and outside it, between Muslims and Christians.A series of massacres in Burkina Faso that has seen gunmen burst into Sunday church services and massacre people at prayer has already sparked anger and terror among Christians in northern Ghana.Some churches have already banned backpacks and placed scanning machines outside their entrances, fearing suicide bombs.If religious and ethnic tensions are mounting in the Gulf of Guinea’s stronger states, the problem is even more acute in Togo and Benin, much poorer, more dysfunctional and more similar to the Sahelian states.Last year two French tourists were kidnapped in the Pendjari national park in northern Benin by Islamic State militants and two French soldiers killed in their eventual rescue.The militants may have been helped, a regional security source said, by locals with land grievances caused by the displacement of locals to create the park, a key refuge for some of the world’s last substantial populations of forest elephant.The jihadists are thought to have slipped into Benin along one of the many smuggler and bandit routes that dot Burkina Faso’s borders with its southern neighbours, he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security.

Insurance policies for accident, illness and unemployment may cover wages lost to coronavirus infection.Sickness cover is unlikely to cover the cost of self-isolation or loss of earnings if work dries up because people are staying home in response to the virus.If you have this kind of protection policy, check what cover you have with your insurer.Uber’s “partner protection” policy, for example covers severe sickness and injury if a medical practitioner signs a driver off for over seven days. From day eight, drivers are eligible for a daily payment for up to 15 days.Work and pensions minister, Justin Tomlinson, attracted criticism when he suggested people rely on benefits if they could not work during the outbreak.“Those whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim Universal Credit andor new-style employment and support allowance,” he said.Universal Credit claimants have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment, however. Given that the government forecasts up to one fifth of the workforce is forecast to be off sick meaning that a significant number of people could struggle to make ends meet.People with no sick pay who may not be able to afford two weeks of self-isolationAlternatively, workers who are unable to work because of a health condition can claim employment and support allowance but only if they have paid National Insurance for the last two to three years.\u0026nbspThe rate for the first 13 weeks is up to £57.90 per week if your aged under 25 or up to £73.10 for over-25s. It then rises to as much as £111.65 depending on inidual circumstances.A spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Our staff are ready to support people if they are affected – we urge them to contact us by phone, or their work coach via their online journal, to explain their situation.If people have to stay home on less than full pay, more people will get into debt. The Money and Pensions Service estimates that 16.7 million people are struggling or squeezed, and these may be particularly unlikely to have financial resilience to get through a period of reduced income.\u0026nbsp“It often only takes one knock to income to push people into problem debt,\u0026nbspsays Sue Anderson, of StepChange debt charity.“Once the immediate threat of coronavirus does pass, it really must be a long term policy goal to improve financial resilience and the way that the welfare system works so that more people are better able to weather short-term financial shocks without being tipped into problem debt.”Further advice on managing debt is available on StepChange’s website:\u0026nbsphttps:www.stepchange.orgShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, many organisations offer their staff sick pay which goes beyond this and so employees should look at their contract or speak with your employer or HR department.“If you are genuinely self-employed, you will not be eligible for statutory sick pay.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Several key partners have also withdrawn from the project, including Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

So that\u0027s something that\u0027s already being considered.David Marcus, who heads the organisation that oversees Libra\u0027s development, outlined what such a system might look like.We could have a series of stablecoins: a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc., Mr Marcus told a banking seminar in October.We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenised digital form... What we care about is the mission and there are a number of ways to go about this.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could not find an explanation for the circular crater that surrounds the hole – or a proper estimate of just how far the underlying cavern might extend.Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life, Nasa wrote on its Astronomy Picture of the Day page, where it shared the image this week.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Since they could include material left their from previous epochs, they may prove a useful way of looking back into Mars\u0027 past.Nasa is only recently starting to dig unto the large unexplored world beneath the Martian surface. Last week, it showed off the first findings from the InSight spacecraft, which revealed that Mars was seismically active and more, in findings that could help reveal how the red planet was formed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and \u0027packing\u0027 - how things fit together.  Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour. Black spots show the wall is too thin for interference colours, indicating the bubble is about to burst! - Kym CoxInstead of swimming, this species spends its time pulsing up and down in the water. Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water.  Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae  grows on the plastic. As it breaks down,  the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne ChiltonThis small beetle is a pest in stored grain and flour products.

The remarkable shape of the nebula resembles that of the continent of North America, complete with a prominent Gulf of Mexico. The Cygnus Wall, a term for the Mexico and Central America part of the North America Nebula, exhibits the most concentrated star formations in the nebula. - Dave WatsonA safety pin is connected to a high tension AC generator. The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain69 Calmness of EternityHimalayas mountains, Nepal.

This new result is particularly exciting since it doesn’t require any concepts that are new to physics.”Co-author of the paper Dr Bashkanov said: “The next step to establish this new dark matter candidate will be to obtain a better understanding of how the d-stars interact: when do they attract and when do they repel each other?“We are leading new measurements to create d-stars inside an atomic nucleus and see if their properties are different to when they are in free space.”The research team at York will now collaborate with scientists in Germany and the US to test their theory of dark matter and search for d-star hexaquarks in the cosmos.A New Possibility for Light-Quark Dark Matter is published in the Journal of Physics G Letters.University of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryMr Sanders was apparently unaware that billionaire Michael Bloomberg had ended his $500m campaign for the nomination and endorsed Mr Biden. He said “Joe” would now be getting Mr Bloomberg’s support, another thing to distinguish it from his.“There has never been a campaign in recent history which has taken on the entire political establishment,” said Mr Sanders. “That is an establishment that is working frantically to try to defeat us.”Among the things he said were trying to defeat him was a super PAC, The Big Tent Project, that had been spending millions of dollars on political advertising aimed at him.\u0026nbsp“Does anyone seriously believe that a president backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and lower-income people desperately need,” he added.What Joe Biden’s comeback on Super Tuesday means for TrumpMr Sanders also said he had spoken to Elizabeth Warren, who performed badly on Tuesday. There is widespread speculation she will soon leave the race, but there is much less clarity about which candidate she will endorse, if either.With Mr Biden now appearing to have the momentum ahead of a flurry of additional primary contests later this month, including Florida, an endorsement from Ms Warren might provide him a crucial lifeline.Yet he said it was right to “respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But lacklustre results from Super Tuesday have encouraged him to drop out.\u0026nbspOn Wednesday, it was announced Mr Bloomberg would be leaving the race and\u0026nbspendorsing\u0026nbspformer Vice President Joe Biden.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesI’m a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible – and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists, Mr Bloomberg said in a\u0026nbspstatement. But I remain clear-eyed about my overriding objective: victory in November. Not for me, but for our country. And so while I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden, he added.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe spoke to supporters in New York later on Wednesday to officially confirm his endorsement of Mr Biden.

To compete, he spent more than $500m\u0026nbspon his campaign with a large amount of that money going towards the 14 Super Tuesday states.But then, just one day before voters went to the polls, both Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr Biden. The vice president also got an endorsement from former Texas Representative\u0026nbspBeto O\u0027Rourke, a move that potentially helped boost Mr Biden to win the state over Bernie Sanders.\u0026nbspStates like California and Maine were still counting their votes – with the former looking like a victory for Mr Sanders and the latter for Mr Biden – but the former vice-president\u0026nbspleft the night as the new frontrunner for the race. Mr Bloomberg, though, only rallied 12 confirmed delegates as of Wednesday morning compared to the vice president\u0027s 404 confirmed delegates.\u0026nbspAlthough Mr Bloomberg had what appeared to be limitless funds to keep his campaign going, he also experienced multiple blunders when trying to garner votes that included underwhelming performances at the debates.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He then won his re-election campaign in 2009 as an independent.Jill Biden called a ‘warrior’ after stopping protester with bare handsThe economic impact of coronavirus so far in five chartsThe former mayor then put his support behind the Democratic Party before joining the race as the last contender in November.

It won’t work!The president might not be currently worried about\u0026nbspthe surge\u0026nbspMr Biden\u0027s campaign has experienced in recent days, but Mr Bloomberg dropping out and endorsing the candidate could help shape the election in the coming months.\u0026nbspAfter the billionaire announced he was dropping from the race, Mr Biden tweeted out a thanks for adding his support to his resurging campaign.\u0026nbsp“I can’t thank you enough for your support — and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change, the vice president wrote\u0026nbspto Mr Bloomberg. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will not allow you to surrender on our future.Thunberg says young climate activists to ‘be the adults in the room’The high-profile 17-year old\u0026nbspSwedish activist, who has acted as a lightning rod of the climate movement, accused the EU nations of\u0026nbsppretending that you can be a climate leader while it continues building and subsidising new fossil fuel infrastructure.The EU has agreed a package of measures to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the same as the UK\u0027s target. The UN\u0027s climate authority the IPCC says that globally, carbon emissions must be cut to net zero by 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5C.While global warming of 1.5C will still have significant negative effects, the effects are less pronounced than if warming reached 2.0C. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says.Some countries have decided to go to net zero faster Finland has said it will achieve the target by 2035.The less ambitious 2050 target is controversial for developed countries like EU member states because under the Paris climate agreement, richer countries are expected to take the lead in decarbonising their economies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need to start cutting carbon emissions drastically at the source, now. Your distant targets will mean nothing is high emissions continue for business as usual even for just a few more years, because that will use up our remaining carbon budget before you have the chance to even deliver on your 2030 goals.When your house is on fire you don\u0027t wait a few more years to start putting it out. And yet, this is what the Commission are proposing today, Ms Thunberg said, following a meeting with Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier in the day.When the EU presents this climate law and net zero by 2050 you indirectly admit surrender: that you are giving up on the Paris agreement, giving up on your promises and giving up on doing everything that you possibly can to ensure a safe future for your children.The activist added: Such a law sends a strong signal that real sufficient action is taking place when in fact it is not. The hard truth is that neither the awareness not politics needed are in sight. We are still in a crisis that has never once been treated for a crisis.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

The visit coincides with the European Commission\u0027s adoption of the EU\u0027s new climate law.President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “We are acting today to make the EU the world’s first climate neutral economic bloc by 2050. The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future.

Is it conceivable under any circumstance, you try and cut off the city in this country ”Mr Hancock replied:  Theres clearly a huge economic and social downside to that.But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage, because you’ve got to make sure that you have all the tools available,that is what’s necessary.But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption.It may be too early to make such calls but the top priority is keeping the public safe, he said.And a vaccine is still months away from being developed.Ministers will this week look at emergency powers they might needthe virus continues to spread - to make sure Britain is fully prepared.Under the worst-case scenario, we would have to take quite signicant action, Mr Hancock told the BBC.We will be publishing battle plans this week that sets those things out.It came as:Health officials are desperate to trace those who were in touch with the man who had walked into a GP surgery in Haslemere,  Surrey.They have not found anything linking him to someone who had been to an affected region abroad.A doctor from the practice also has symptoms, ex-Health Secretary and local MP Jeremy Hunt said.A senior health source said: “This is our nightmare scenario. It’s spreading uncontrollably and we are losing our grip.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock this morning said the Government already were able to forcibly quarantine members of the populationthey were at risk.And thanks to large-scale No Deal planning in the past six months, the country already has stockpiles of several types of drug that could be usedneeded to try and treat the virus.He also cast into doubt the information coming from other countries such as China and Iran on coronavirus - amid fears they are suppressing the true number of people affected.We dont think all the figures from around the world are fully accurate, he said.We update [our] figures all the time... but we dont say any of those figures are concrete and definitive.The Health Secretary said today people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.Experts have warned that desperate moves to contain the Covid- outbreak could decimate all sport across the UK for months.Clubs yesterday began taking their own precautions to protect star players from infection.Tottenham’s injured South Korean ace Son Heung-min, , has been forced to self-isolate for two weeks after ing from his home country, where hundreds of cases have erupted.Last night the outbreak was casting a shadow over horse racing’s historic Cheltenham Festival, which begins in  days time.Organisers insist it is “full steam ahead” for the four-day meeting.But the odds of racing not taking place on the first day were a mere   last night.Cheltenham expects , spectators to attend the festival and the event in Gloucestershire will not take place without them.Rugby has already been hit by the postponement of next week’s Six Nations clash between Ireland and virus-plagued Italy.Englands football friendly against Italy at Wembley on Friday March  is still officially on — though it is subject to review.The Chinese Formula One Grand Prix scheduled for April  has been postponed, while other races are in doubt.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty. But the mandarins are fighting a Fth Column battle to keep Britain tied to the EU’s apron strings.“The first six months are critical,” says a senior ­ministerial source. “It’s all to play for.”MILLIONAIRE lawyer “Sir” Keir Starmer QC – he pretends to hate the title – is now a racing certainty for Jeremy Corbyn’s job as Labour leader.This chameleon politician is a protege of Labour dud Gordon Brown. They remain close.It was Brown who made Starmer Director of Public Prosecutions, a post he disgraced by ­persecuting innocent journalists for publishing the truth.He was rewarded with his knighthood and one of ­Labour’s safest seats in posh Holborn and St Pancras, a stone’s throw from his Doughty Street Chambers.Labour is welcome to the cad. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If lockdown was imposed for a month, this rises to £. billion.”This morning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development slashed the  global growth forecast by .% over the outbreak.It

Ashworth said: If the medical advice and the scientic advice is to take measures along those lines, of course we would support them.If the medical advice is to do something like that then of course we should support it.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

However, this does not mean they protect you from -nCoV infection.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.Meanwhile, leading symptom-checking provider to the NHS Doctorlink has been updated to help identy patients risk of having coronavirus.Source: NHSWhile eating garlic can help to treat the common cold, it wont stop you from being infected with coronavirus.Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties, WHO say.However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.Young people are also at risk of COVID-, despite patterns showing the elderly are struck more often.People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus , WHO say.Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditionsappear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.WHO have urged people not to use UV lamps to sterilise hands or other areas of skin in a bid to beat coronavirus.The organisation said: UV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.Thermal scanners are currently being used at airports, train stations and other public places to detect those with a high temperature.But while these scanners after effective in detecting people who have developed a fever because of infection with the new coronavirus - it wont pick up those yet to display symptoms.WHO said: Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a feverbecause of infection with the new coronavirus.However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever.This is because it takes between  and  days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.WHO have slammed people who claim spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will kill viruses that have already entered your body.Instead they say: Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes .Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.Contrary to assumptions, it is actually safe to receive packages from China.People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the new coronavirus, WHO say.From previous analysis, we know coronaviruses do not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages.According to WHO, it is  for people to say that pneumonia vaccines will protect you against coronavirus.Vaccines for COVID- are still in the making and are unlikely to be finished in time to curb the current outbreak.Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type Bvaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus, WHO say.The virus is so new and dferent that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against -nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.Although these vaccines are not effective against -nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the new coronavirus, WHO say.There is some limited evidence that regularly rinsing nose with saline can help people recover more quickly from the common cold, the organisation adds.However, regularly rinsing the nose has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections.Sesame oil is a staple in Asian cooking - but thats about all its good for.Sesame oil does not kill the new coronavirus, WHO warn.There are some chemical disinfectants that can kill the -nCoV on surfaces.These include bleach chlorine-based disinfectants, either solvents, % ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform.However, they have little or no impact on the virusyou put them on the skin or under your nose. It can even be dangerous to put these chemicals on your skin.COVID- is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.WHO say: No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.The new coronavirusis a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.However,you are hospitalized for the -nCoV, you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not for me, but for our country.And so while I will not be the nominee, I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my le.Bloomberg previously saidhe dropped out of the race, his campaign offices would remain open in key states until November in an effort to take down Trump.The former NYC Mayor teared up when speaking at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.These past few months have been some of the most inspiring, certainly in my le and I hope in yours, he told his supporters.In just  days, I have been to  cities in  states all across the country.In every place we went, I listened to Americans of every age and every race and every ethnicity and every religion and every identity and orientation.And I heard about their hopes, and their dreams, and their fears and their struggles.Bloomberg praised his supporters, saying, no campaign has ever accomplished as much as you did in such a short period of time.He said this really is the best, most creative, most hardworking campaign ever assembled.Today, sorry we didnt win, but its still the best day of my le and tomorrow is going to be even better.He added that there is no doubt in my mind we wouldve beaten Donald Trump in November.And you know who  knows that, Donald Trump. Hes been scared stf of us and for good reason.Every time he hit us, we hit back twice as hard.And unlike his jabs, our punches packed the truth.Trump immediately hit back after the billionaire announced he was stopping his campaign Wednesday morning, saying he knew Bloomberg didnt have what it takes to become president.I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost.Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign, hoping to save face. It won’t work!Trump added in a separate tweet: Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS.This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his le...and now on to Sleepy Joe!He later slammed Bloomberg and former candidate and billionaire Tom Steyer, who dropped out of the race over the weekend.Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, Tom Steyer, have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! Trump tweetedThey both wish they had it to do over again!As Bloomberg announced his drop from the race, Warren was reportedly meeting with her campaign advisers to find outshe should stay in the race for president following her flop on Tuesday.Reports surfaced that an all-staff email sent out by Roger Lau to the Massachusetts Senators campaign said they fell well short of viability goals and projections Tuesday night.This decision is in her hands, and it’s important that she has the time and space to consider what comes next, the message said, as reported by The Boston Globe.Bloombergs exit came after a string of scandals, including allegations from past NDAs coming back to haunt him on the campaign trail.He allegedly told a former sales worker to abort her baby when she said she was pregnant.According to documents obtained by the Washington Post, Sekiko Sakai Garrison allegedly told Bloomberg she was pregnant in  — to which he responded, Kill it!Bloomberg has denied the comment, and the suit was settled out of court, but reports surfaced that Garrison was one of the women who had an NDA.He was also accused of telling another employee who was struggling to find childcare for her kids to hire some black, the Washington Post reported.All you need is some black who doesnt have to speak English to rescue it from a burning building, he was accused of saying.Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren both slammed Bloomberg over alleged past comments and treatment of women in the workplace onstage during a Las Vegas debate.The other Democratic candidates demanded Bloomberg release the women who signed the non-disclosure agreements.Bloomberg defended his use of the documents when pressed at the debate.None of them accuse me of doing anything other than maybe they didnt like a joke I told, he said.The agreements between two parties that wanted to keep it quiet and thats up to them.They signed those agreements and well live with it.He later announced he would release three women from the agreementsthey contacted his office.Bloombergs campaign was also clouded by his former defense of the controversial stop-and-frisk tactic used by the NYPD when he was mayor.In resurfaced audio from a  speech at Aspen Institute, Bloomberg defended the controversial policing strategy - and was ripped for his comments.“You can take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, sixteen to twenty-five. That’s true in New York, that’s true in virtually every city… and that’s where the real crime is,” he said.He added: “You want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets, put the cops where the crime is in the minority neighborhoods.“And the way you get the guns out of the kids’ hands is to throw them up against the walls and frisk them,” Bloomberg added.Biden dubbed Bloombergs stop-and-frisk policy as abhorrent at the Las Vegas debate.Warren said that Democrats would not beat Trump in the  electionwe have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax s, of supporting racist policies like red-lining and stop and frisk.After spending a whopping  million on his campaign, the billionaire claimed his first — and only victory — in American Samoa, a tiny South Pacic U.S. Territory on Tuesday.Biden claimed victory in nine states on Super Tuesday, and is now in a two-horse race for the Democratic nomination with Sanders.Bloomberg added as he announced his drop from the race: Im immensely proud of the campaign we ran. Im deeply grateful to all the Americans who voted for me, and to our dedicated staff and volunteers.I want you to stay engaged, active, and committed to our issues.Biden thanked Bloomberg for his support Wednesday.@MikeBloomberg, I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change, Biden said in a statement.This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics.It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it.I will be right there with you. And together, we will get it done, he said.Bernie Sanders tweeted that the U.S. needs new politics as Bloomberg announced he was dropping from the race.You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics, Sanders tweeted.What we need is a new politics that brings working class people and young people into our political movement, he wrote.At a press conference Wednesday, however, Sanders was shocked to learn Bloomberg dropped out of the race when questioned by a reporter about what he thought of the former Mayors run.Has he stepped out  The Vermont Senator questioned.Its the first Ive heard about that.He certainly brought a lot of money into this race. He certainly made a lot of television networks very, very wealthy and Im sure theyre very disappointed that hes leaving.I have no animosity for Mayor Bloomberg. I certainly strongly disagree with many of his policies as Mayor of the city New York.But this just confirms what I said.I suspect we will see a lot of money coming into Bidens campaign, probably a lot of negative ads attacking me, - thats what were taking on, Sanders said.A wave of former Warren supporters announced their new support for Sanders Wednesday, amid the Massachusetts Senators meeting to discuss her future in the race.Sanders said he spoke with Warren Wednesday as she was deciding the direction she would move, and called her a very, very excellent senator who ran a strong campaign.Sen. Warren told me she is assessing her campaign, Sanders told reporters.She has not made any decisions as of this point.It is important, I think for all of us, certainly me, who has known Elizabeth many, many years, to respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision, he added.Bloomberg entered the race for president late in the game, as he announced his candidacy in late November.He quickly pumped millions of dollars into his campaign — and ended up spending more than  million for each delegate he had won by the end of the night Tuesday.Donald Trump Jr. joined in railing Bloombergs flopped candidacy for President Wednesday on Twitter.It was a short campaign, he said, alluding to his fathers nickname for the former NYC Mayor, Mini Mike.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other.

Its bright green looks like a chemical in the meat!”Natasha Probert, who bought a cooked chicken from her local Sainsburys in Biddulph, Stafforshire had the same issue.She posted photos of the £. chicken, writing: “My rotisserie chicken is green!”Twitter user @Gilly tweeted a photo of her green meat from Sainsbury’s, which the supermarket soon apologised for.Sainsburys customer service team replied: “Sorry about the green chicken!“Green muscle meat is not harmful but certainly not appealing and is off putting”. The team assured the customer they would look into her complaint.Morrisons customer Amber North was left “feeling sick” after cooking her roast chicken – only to find it had turned a putrid green inside.She wrote on Twitter: “The smell made me feel so sick! Lucky our children didnt eat any before we realised it was green.”A Sainsbury’s spokesperson told the Sun Online: “We have apologised to Natasha and Gilly for this rare, unpleasant find and are investigating with our supplier.”A Tesco spokesperson said: “We’re sorry to hear about this.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now. But what about when they’ve all gone and started to annoy someone  Who will be left to look at those selfies  Apart from Stacey THERE’S outrage in Darlington over the plight of a bunch of hamsters found in a hedge. Locals are more disgusted than at any time since my band, Dangerbird, played there in .These hamsters were in plastic boxes. And one can only assume they were bred to feed snakes. They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph. The experts reckon it will just miss us. But they can’t be exactly sure. Bob could swing by to say hello. In which case you can wear as many face masks as you like but it won’t help you one bit.You can even follow the BBC’s excellent advice on “how to wash your hands”. .Bob won’t care. You’ll be locked away in your self-isolating chamber under the stairs. Hands smothered in Dettol. Poncey face mask bought off Amazon. Stacks of dried food to keep you through the entire spring.And then – bang!

The Government handed a former aide to Ms Patel a £, payout after she claimed she was bullied by the then-employment minister. And we have been told she also complained to Tory Party HQ, but received no response. Legal notes, seen by the BBC, allege the woman took an overdose of prescription medicine after a  incident involving Ms Patel. The Home Secretary faces a Cabinet Office probe on claims over treatment of officials in three departments during her ministerial career. Labour today accused Boris Johnson of “covering up” bullying and said it had received fresh allegations about Ms Patel from Government staff in the past  hours.But the PM said he was “sticking by” Ms Patel and put on a public show of support by sitting beside her in the Commons.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called on him to release the findings of the Cabinet Office probe.He said: “A government cannot be judge and jury over its own conduct – there has to be an independent element to that investigation. “We have a part-time Prime Minister who barely turns up but is determined to cover up for bullies.” Ms Patel could be forced to give evidence under oath to an employment tribunal launched by Sir Philip Rutnam.  He quit as Home Office Permanent Secretary at the weekend, accusing her of bullying and vowing to sue for constructive dismissal. The case involving alleged bullying of the aide at the Department for Work and Pensions then emerged.

Staff said Diefer was very anxious when he first arrived, but described him as a very friendly dog and are mystied as to why he has been unable to find a new owner. They say they have worked hard to reassure nine-year-old Diefer, making sure to spend time with him daily to introduce new ways to have fun. Hayley Crookes, the Animal Care Lead at RSPCA Sheffield Animal Centre, said: “We are heartbroken that the lovely Diefer hasn’t found his forever home yet. He has been so close but sadly it has fallen through when someone showed an interest in him. “He has waited  long days since his owner passed away to find a new home. We’re not sure why as he is a very friendly dog who deserves a home to call his own.  “He goes for lovely leisurely walks and loves to see the sights and take in the world. We have shown him some fun ways to channel his energy by doing things like scent work. We have also helped him tweak his manners, he will now happily swap his toys for another or something equally as fun. Once he is comfortable with you, he is an absolute diamond. His favourite people get cuddles and kisses by the bucket load and he really does enjoy human company. He has such an affectionate side to him as well as a cheeky side to his personality which we just find very charming!” Diefer would like to live in an adult-only home with no other pets as he is choosy about the dogs he likes to interact with and doesn’t like sharing human affection.

The UK saw its biggest day-on-day increase as Englandaposs chief medical officer said some Britons will probably die during the outbreak. Hospitals are bracing for a rapid increase in the number of cases in the coming days and weeks, with Professor Chris Whitty warning that a large outbreak now seems inevitable. Most of the latest infections were transmitted abroad, but Professor Whitty warned that community transmission is undoubtedly already occurring and will lead to a surge in cases. Here is a summary of the latest coronavirus headlines on Wednesday. Follow our live blog for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak. Where are the latest cases  * A woman in her s who works at Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle, and her husband. Colin Cox, director of public health at Cumbria County Council, said two Carlisle residents had tested positive for Covid- after ing from a trip to northern Italy. He said: Since ing from their trip they have self-isolated. The member of staff did not come into work and has not had any contact with patients. The level of risk to the public has not changed and remains low. There is no need for anyone to cancel medical appointments. * A London-based Deloitte employee. A floor at Deloitte’s London office on New Street Square, in Holborn, was cleared and was undergoing a deep clean. A Deloitte spokesperson said: “One of the floors in our offices has recently been impacted, with a member of staff being confirmed with Covid- after ing from a personal trip to Asia. The member of staff is now in hospital and receiving good care. * A patient who was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.  A spokesman for the health and social care system in Manchester said: [Wythenshawe Hospital] remains open and we would ask that people keep their appointments and attend unless they are unwell. Please note the risk from the virus for the majority of people is low. * A pupil at Kingston Academy in south-west London. * A patient in Grampian in Scotland. * A patient in Ayrshire in Scotland. * Two cases confirmed in South Ribble, Lancashire. * Two further cases in Northern Ireland, bringing the total there to three.  A Department of Health statement said: Testing of patients in Northern Ireland has resulted in two further presumptive positive results for coronavirus , bringing the total to three since testing began. In line with established protocols, these Northern Ireland test outcomes have been sent to Public Health England laboratories for verication. The two cases are not connected. One inidual recently travelled from Northern Italy. The other had recent contact with a person where in the UK who has subsequently tested positive for Covid-. Both patients are adults and are receiving appropriate care. Public Health Agency personnel are working rapidly to identy contacts they may have had, with the aim of preventing further spread.  * Students at Goldsmiths in south London have been informed that a visitor to one of the universityaposs halls of residences had tested positive for the coronavirus. In an email, the university said the person was being looked after and that the student they were staying with is self-isolating as a precautionary measure. * Three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Trafford, Greater Manchester. The three people had all travelled to northern Italy, a statement on the Trafford Council website said. These cases are not related to the patient at Wythenshawe Hospital who tested positive for the virus. * A case of coronavirus was also confirmed in Oldham, Greater Manchester.  Biggest day-on-day increase as cases soar to  The UK has seen its biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, with  people now confirmed to have the virus. Amid further reports of panic buying at shops, three of the  new cases in England were passed on in the UK, raising fears that community transmission may now be taking hold. Prof Whitty said: Twenty-nine patients [in England] were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. Three additional patients contracted the virus in the UK and it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an inidual who had recently ed from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The two new Scottish coronavirus cases are from the Grampian and Ayrshire areas, the Scottish Government said. Both patients are described as currently clinically well. One patient has recently travelled to northern Italy. The other has had contact with a known positive case, although officials said it was not with the first positive case in Scotland, a patient in Tayside. Scotlandaposs Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: Our first thoughts must be with the patients diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a full and speedy recovery.  Britons aposwill dieapos and large epidemic aposlikelyapos Professor Whitty warned that some Britons will probably die from coronavirus during an outbreak that will last up to six months. He said a large epidemic is looking likely, but it is very unlikely that entire cities or towns will be locked down. He is expecting a signicant increase in the number of cases in the coming days and weeks. Onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - is undoubtedly happening already, he added. Extreme measures may have to be taken to protect the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. NHS aposcan cope with large epidemicapos  Professor Whitty said the NHS would be able to cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic. Video conference consultations might be used as a way to relieve pressure on the NHS, he added. Professor Whitty said the NHS would look to retired doctors for help, as well as getting doctors doing one kind of a job doing another kind of the job. The NHS has declared a level  incident - the highest level - and the Government has launched a new campaign to encourage people to take simple steps to protect themselves.  Professor Whitty had earlier predicted that up to  per cent of Britons could be infected and one per cent of the infected could die in a worst case scenario. Government scientic experts predict the UKaposs coronavirus outbreak could last around four to six months. PM announces sick pay after pressure  The Prime Minister announced new sick pay changes as part of emergency coronavirus legislation so that anyone self-isolating is paid from day one rather than day four as current rules state. Boris Johnson told MPs that people who self-isolate are helping to protect all of us by slowing the spread of the virus.He added: If they stay at home andwe ask people to self-isolate, they may lose out financially. So, I can today announce that the Health Secretary will bring forward, as part of our emergency coronavirus legislation, measures to allow the payment of statutory sick pay from the very first day you are sick instead of four days under the current rules, and I think thataposs the right way forward. Nobody should be penalised for doing the right thing. Coronavirus-related racism in schools Teachers of Chinese and other ethnic minority origin are being subjected to racist name-calling, banter and intimidation in schools as fears of the coronavirus spread, a union has warned. The NASUWT teachersapos union said reports by its members of abuse, prejudice, xenophobia and racism in schools have increased since the outbreak reached the UK. The union said there had been a report of groups of pupils playing an unsavoury game of tag named after the coronavirus. In letters to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and his counterparts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the NASUWT union warned of pupils and school staff being verbally and physically abused on grounds that appear to be racially motivated. Events and graduations cancelled Several events have been cancelled and graduation ceremonies postponed due to coronavirus fears. The London Book Fair at Olympia from March  to  was scrapped after major publishers pulled out. Buckingham University and the University of London said they had taken a dficult decision to call off ceremonies this month to minimise the risks to students and their guests. Fears of first human-to-dog transmission Animal health experts said the quarantined dog of a coronavirus patient in Hong Kong could be the first case of human-to-animal transmission, although they cautioned the matter remained under investigation. The dog has tested weak positive for the virus which indicates a low level of infection, the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said. The department will continue to closely monitor the dog ... and repeat the test later. It will only be ed to its owner when the test result is negative, an AFCD statement said. Killer virus mutates into second, more contagious strain "},{"url":null,"title":"everyone mocking mistake home office","story":"NewsEveryone is mocking mistake as Home Office shows off new blue British passportThe Home Office posted a video on social media to show off the new blue British passport which has started being issued this month - but some spotted a problem with the example being usedShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video home-office-showcase--blue-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news everyone-mocking-mistake-home-office-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The government has said that from aposmid-apos every new passport sent out will be blue.On Monday, the Home Office Twitter account posted a clip flicking through the new look with the caption: Britons will once again be able to travel with a blue passport when the iconic colour s for the first time in almost  years.A sea of comments flooded in criticising the move, with one writing: Offering the ability to work, live, retire in one declining country. Great! - but there were those who were happy to see it as another said: Bring it on. Will happily replace my current one for a new British one.

Esme said: When she vomited and her eyes were shut, and she didnapost speak that well, I knew my mummy was unwell. When the ambulance came I was very happy.

Leah Cordice had claimed in her defence that she was raped by the boy when she was  years old but a jury rejected her claim by convicting her of three counts of sexual activity with a child.The presiding judge told the court after hearing the juryaposs verdict: To be sexist about this,she was a man, custody would be almost inevitable.The jury acquitted Cordice of two other counts of sexual activity of a child which were alleged to have taken place when Cordice was aged  years.Cordice, of Windsor, Berks., showed no emotion as the foreman of the jury of seven men and four women read out the unanimous verdicts.  Judge Peter Clarke QC then told the jury: I have got to consider a custodial sentence. To be sexist about this,Leah was a young man of  years and the complainant was a -year-old girl, the sentence would be almost inevitable as far as custody is concerned. It is all very unfortunate for everyone, herself included, but I was struck, as I suspect you were, by her lack of self-awareness of what she was doing to the victim. It seems to me that one of the evils here is that, for the rest of his le, the victim will know that that baby is living somewhere that he does not know about and that - I can say as a man - would be as scarring for a father as for a mother. That is a further matter I need to consider and the impact that it has had on him.  The court heard that the boy victim would attend court with his parents to see Cordice being sentenced next month and had prepared a victim impact statement. Judge Clarke adjourned the case so that a probation report could be created about Cordice. Tara McCarthy, who was defending Cordice, said: This is a very sad situation all around and obviously, Your Honour, I will address you in terms of mitigation. Cordice, who appeared in court wearing a big camouflage jacket and a black top, was released on bail to await sentencing. Judge Clarke told her: I need to know more about you and your present circumstances. You should understand that I have to be considering an immediate custodial sentence. Cordice had seduced the boy while he was playing computer games on the Xbox in his bedroom, where she had pulled down his trousers and asked for sex, the court had heard. To keep the affair alive, Cordice had sent the boy complimentary text messages and bought him presents of fish and chips, the jury at Reading Crown Court was told.

What was supposed to be a relaxing weekend with the family turned into a grim ordeal for Teresa Barbato who couldnapost believe the Brean Sands resort expected her elderly and disabled relatives sleep on bunk beds. The accommodation at the resort in Somerset was not what -year-old Teresa from Port Talbot thought she had booked for her partner, mum, granny and grannyaposs partner. After paying £ for two apartments for three nights, they left after after just one night.Teresa told Wales Online : As soon as we opened the door we found problems. We couldnapost believe they expected elderly, disabled people to sleep on bunk beds.Also, my mother and I have fibromyalgia and my partner is ft ins tall so it wasnapost appropriate for any of us. They ask the age and other details for people before they stay to aposallow the allocation of appropriate accommodation,apos which this wasnapost. The filthy state of the holiday camp accommodation was clear from the moment they arrived they claim. They found that one of the rooms had childrenaposs bunk beds in and they claim there was mould in the bedrooms, faulty electronics, and what they thought was faeces on a pull-out sofa bed. Teresa received an email from Pontins shortly before the break to offer the family a free upgrade to a higher standard of apartment, called a Club Apartment, which they accepted. But when they arrived on Friday, February , they were shocked.  Teresaaposs grandmother, Mary John, , and her grandmotheraposs partner, Douglas Hookins, , both have disabilities. We thought a weekend away would be nice and let everyone forget about their problems for a bit, said Theresa. After seeing the state of the rooms, we said weaposd make the best of a bad situation and just use the rooms as base but by the Saturday morning weaposd had enough, we packed up and went home.  On Saturday, Teresa, who has asthma, says she woke up with a tight chest. I got out of bed on Saturday and stood right in a puddle of water, there was mould on the walls which must be what set off my asthma, she said.  Her mother, Rebecca Barbato, was staying in the one bedroom chalet opposite and had problems of her own.  There was a pool of water in the shower that must have been there for days because it had dead flies and spiders in it and there were black stains in the toilet, said Teresa. There were also exposed wires in the bathroom and my partner said aposimaginea child touched thoseapos. My mother pulled out the sofa bed and there was what looked like faeces on it.  Shortly after arriving on Friday, Teresa had been to the reception at Brean Sands and said the manager offered her a downgrade to standard apartments, but was told she would have to pay for electricity in the roomsthey decided to move. She added that a cleaner was sent to their rooms as well but all they did was let the water out of the shower basin and flush the toilet. The family decided against the offered downgrade and made the two-hour drive back to Port Talbot on Saturday morning.

At the beginning of last year my kids and I had bronchitis. We have never had it before and I think itaposs from living here because the mould keeps growing all the time. When we came to view the flat it was lovely. Mould then started to appear about three to four months after we moved in on July , . There was quite a lot of mould and there was a funny smell I couldnapost pinpoint. I then found mould in the cupboards, as well as on the walls around the flat. I got in touch with The Guinness Partnership and told them how bad it was, and have been back to them numerous time since. Thermal boards were put in the front room and my bedroom. I was told it would stop the mould but it hasnapost.  In September last year, Lauren had a new bath, towel rail and flooring fitted, and some wall tiles replaced. The ceiling also had mould treatment but she said it failed to solve the problem and work is now being carried out on it again. The housing association says the property is suffering from penetrating damp and a damp specialist will be attending to identy works required. Lauren said: The mould has been growing back horrendously since. The bathroom is now completely ruined and paint is coming off.  In my daughteraposs room there is bad mould by the side of her bed as well as at the back of my bed. We also get mould in the wardrobes and on the ceilings. I keep being promised things which have not yet been done. I have previously been told the reason for the mould is the type of house it is and to keep the windows open and the property ventilated, which I do anyway. I have also tried treating it myself. I continue to wipe the mould away and have painted the walls with anti-mould paint, but it doesnapost work. A housing officer and surveyor came out two weeks ago and I was told they would look at the drains to seethey are blocked because I have damp as well as mould. In my bedroom cupboard it is wet inside, as well as in my walk-in wardrobe.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA Tory peer grabbed a masseuseaposs bottom, pointed to his groin and askedshe did extras, a court heard today. Lord Holmes of Richmond, , denies sexual touching in the luxury hotel’s spa on March  last year. The nine-time Paralympic champion, who went blind at , claims he was only trying to trace her outline. But he is alleged to have firmly grabbed the masseuseaposs bottom towards the end of the treatment, and askedhe could touch her breasts and give him sexual release. He is also said to have taken advantage of the masseuseaposs unease at being around blind people so he could talk himself out of it.  Southwark Crown Court heard that when she said she was a professional after the touching, Holmes asked her: Are you sure youaposve never done it  Linda Strudwick, prosecuting, said Holmes had paid for a  minute massage costing £, and may have initially broken the disposable underwear given to him before he went into the spa. She said: Mr Holmes had been given disposable underwear to use during the massage. This underwear appears to have become broken, whether Mr Holmes did this deliberately or it was an accident the prosecution quite do not know. It is right to say that these garments are not the sturdiest of underpants. Mr Holmes askedhe could take them off and [the woman] said that he could provided he ensured that the towel covered him. [The masseuse] noticed that Mr Holmes appeared to flick the towel so as to leave his buttocks uncovered. She assumed that this was accidental and so she recovered him tucking the towel under his stomach. As she was massaging her left thigh, he said that aposshe could go highershe wanted toapos. Mr Holmes grabbed her left arm and levered himself to sitting position asking whether he could see how she looked. [The masseuse] was a bit confused by that but agreed thinking that this was what blind people do. Ms Strudwick continued: What happened next was a deliberate sexual assault. Mr Holmes wanted more than a massage.  She began to feel uncomfortable and tried to move away from him. She was prevented from doing so by Mr Holmes grabbing her buttocks and thus holding her in place. Thataposs between his legs. He askedhe could touch her boobs and he pointed to his groin and askedshe did extras, plainly you may think a reference to her giving him some sort of sexual relief. She said, aposno I am a professionalapos. She was shocked and she was embarrassed. Nothing like this had ever happened to her before. Mr Holmes realising that he was not going to get what he wanted he began to apologise and spent time reassuring and calming her. Ms Strudwick said Holmes denies any sexual touching, and read out a statement he gave to police. He said: As I am blind I cannot aposseeapos - but I can get a sense of what a person looks like through touch, which is the only sense I can use to get an image in my mind of peopleaposs appearance. It is obviously a bit strange to be massaged by someone, without knowing what they look like. By touching I mean lightly tracing the outline of the other person rather than grabbing them in a firm way. As I am basing my recollection only on touch I cannot be sure exactly where my hands rested but there was absolutely no intention to touch her in a sexual way. It was purely to give me an idea of her appearance. I am certain that I did not ask the therapist for aposextrasapos and am adamant that I did not point to the area of my groin at any time. I did not ask the therapist for sexual services of any kind and I am well aware that those sorts of services are not available in respectable hotel spas, with trained massage therapists.  I can completely understand that the therapist may have been confused and upset by my request to touch her as I cannot imagine that she sees very many completely blind clients, who would make a request of this kind. It is always dficult for me and other blind people to ask to touch sighed people, but it is a basic human instinct to want to know what somebody looks like and this is the only way we have. The prosecutor however said his motives were not innocent. Ms Strudwick added: To ask at the end when he was never going to see the masseuse again suggests his motives were not innocent. Some people do not like to be touched, some women wear makeup and dress their hair, and none of these matters were addressed by Mr Holmes. Rather, he knew that the sighted are often embarrassed and do not know what to do around blind people and he used that. Mr Holmes thought thathe was not successful in his bid for sexual release he could talk his way out of it. The prosecutor said the masseuse was immediately upset and told her manager, who said she was shaking. Ms Strudwick added: The defence will say that she has made up this allegation. That she is deliberately lying to gain some benefit, some compensation.  Given her allegation was made immediately, when she was still shocked and has not changed at all, you may think that is not credible and that the defence are only using the only defence they have. You might also want to consider that[the masseuse] is lying with a motive of financial gain, she might have made a rather more serious allegation. The court heard that Holmes did not want to be known by his full title, Lord Holmes of Richmond, at the hearings. The politician, who wore a navy suit and a yellow striped tie, was led into Southwark Crown Court with defence counsel Sarah Forshaw QC and his assistant black Labrador, Nancy. He was allowed to sit outside the dock to better hear the opening, although the jury was told Holmes will be ed when the complainant gives evidence behind a screen.

He lowered his head towards the table and began to cry, his granddaughter Hayley Dickson, , recalled. At that point a manager came over. Hayley claimed the member of staff accused Fred of being drunk and falling asleep at the table, asking them to leave. However, a spokesperson from the pub chain said it fully backed the actions of staff and said the group were asked to leave due to a genuine belief that they were intoxicated and one of them then became abusive towards staff. The family strongly deny the claims. My Nan passed away two weeks ago and the funeral was on Monday, Hayley said. The next day my grandad was really upset so we decided to take him out for a meal and a drink. They were married for  years and had known each other for  years.

But she just kept repeating the same thing - that itaposs company policy to ask someone who is drunk and asleep to leave. Hayley asked to speak to another manager, but was told no one was available. She was eventually given an email address that she could send a complaint to.

She said: We all got up to leave and the staff stood watching as my grandad walked out with his head down. He was so embarrassed. I had been polite and didnapost get angry but when we were leaving I did shout that my nan had lung cancer and had just passed away, so that everyone in the pub could hear. I wanted everyone to know how theyaposd treated us and that we hadnapost done anything wrong. I think itaposs disgusting that they could treat an -year-old man like that.

His tiny daughter was soaking, her teeth chattering with cold after falling in during the illegal two-hour crossing of the five-mile strait from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos. They had been given fake lejackets filled with useless ­packaging foam by the people-smuggler who persuaded them to pay , each for their passage on an inflatable dinghy. Yesterday, after camping out for two nights with other newly arrived Afghan families, ­Shamsullah and his children were herded on to a minibus hired by the authorities. The -year-old dad-of-four didn’t realise it, but this was probably the end of the dream. As Lesbos battles vigilante groups who are targeting its overcrowded migrant camp – and the volunteers who help out there – the government is changing tactics. While clashes between police and migrants continue at the country’s land border with Turkey, here the arrivals were driven to a ship on which they will be temporarily housed. The ship will transport them to a closed detention centre on the Greek mainland, and from there the likelihood is that they will be deported back to Afghanistan, their home country. Under emergency measures introduced by Greece’s Prime Minister last week, they cannot apply for asylum. Shamsullah tells me through a translator: “We all left our home at night. We gathered what we thought we would need for the journey and just left. “Our village in Helmand Province was being attacked by the Taliban because we are a minority tribe. They wanted us out. I had already been injured in an Islamic State bomb attack.  “After many months walking, getting across the sea was the worst thing. “My two-year-old daughter fell in. She has been coughing and very sick. Maybe she has pneumonia. Now, thank God, she is getting medical help.” As he talks, his sons Yasin, six and Mahamad, four, throw pebbles into the sea. His other daughter, Sahirah, shows me their pile of belongings. They have six blankets and six sleeping bags in bin liners, and little . Kostas, a police officer helping clear up, surveys the pitul scene. “This is an impossible problem,” he says. “It is inhuman to leave them, but people here in Lesbos feel they have been abandoned by the government and by Europe.” He picks up the fake lejackets left on a bench where tourists would usually come to admire the view, muttering: “They would actually drown more quickly wearing these.”  Around the coast, an EU flag flutters as a reminder that this is the frontier of Europe. Greek coastguard vessels are the only ships on the horizon. The latest influx of migrants was prompted by Turkey’s hardline president Erdogan declaring his nation’s borders with Europe were open. He said Turkey had no choice after . million Syrian refugees flooded in. But Greece toughened up security. Yesterday Turkey said a Pakistani migrant was shot dead by Greek security forces at the land border. Greece denies the claims. It also faced global condemnation after footage emerged of a packed dinghy nearly capsizing as a coastguard ship sped towards it.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/Gjen_Dundee_United_Academy-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee united academy coaches helping club move with trends in modern game","story":"Dundee United academy duo Thomas Courts and Andy Payne are working to shape ‘modern’ stars of the future under the club’s revamped grassroots set-up.Since academy director Andy Goldie took charge of the Terrors’ youth ranks in February last year, the club have achieved ‘Elite’ status in the Scottish FA’s Project Brave initiative and helped introduced the likes of Louis Appere and Declan Glass to Robbie Neilson’s first team.Helping make United’s one of the best youth set-ups in the country has been a new staff, including head of tactical performance Courts, formerly manager of Kelty Hearts, and head of technical performance Payne, coach at the club for  years and nephew of ex-Tannadice star Graham.Their remit oversees the younger kids in the academy from U  to U , with the pair working closely to develop players equipped for the on-the-ball and off-the-ball demands of first-team football in .And theirs are roles they find very rewarding as they watch youngsters fulfil their potential – whether that’s with Dundee United, another club or outwith football altogether.Courts said: “I think within the academy set-up what we’re trying to do is give them a technical and tactical framework that can allow them to maximise their potential.“It’s actually also about surviving and thriving domestically and playing within Scotland.“We’re taking them down to the elite level in England and overseas in Europe for games and learning.“We want to design a game model that allows them to go into dferent environments and feel they have the skillset to fulfil their potential.” vw, px\"  Both men feel there is a profile of ‘creative flair’ when you think of a Dundee United player, which they are keen to maintain within their plans.Payne said: “I suppose there is. Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great. We’ve got some of the best people around.“If you look at the profile of the type of player this club tends to produce, there’s a creative flair but we want to help by giving them as much information as possible.”Payne added: “Logan Chalmers and Keiran Freeman are next in line.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5ce776b724e6.95875127-scaled.jpg ","title":"mcpake and dee make good use of idle saturday after arbroath clash called off","story":"Dundee mounted a spying mission on their next three opponents after Saturday’s clash with Arbroath was called off.With the Dens Park pitch waterlogged, the Dark Blues squad headed instead to an impromptu indoor training session at the city’s Regional Performance Centre.But the day wasn’t over for the Dee coaching staff.First-team coach Dave Mackay was dispatched to Ayr’s Championship win over Alloa, while assistant boss Jimmy Nicholl saw Dunfermline down Dundee United at East End Park.The Dark Blues face the Wasps tomorrow night, before a double header with the Honest Men is rounded off by a visit from the Pars a week on Saturday.And, despite gaffer James McPake’s irritation with the weekend call-off, he is pleased with how his staff worked it to their advantage. vw, px\"  “It was a frustrating one,” admitted James.“We’d worked all week in preparation for Arbroath and, by the time Saturday comes around, you’re desperate to get out there.“But, at the same time, the pitch was nowhere near playable and the referee who came in to do the inspection made the call.“It’s a pain but it’s part of football. The games are stacking up a wee bit but we just have to get on with it.“We trained on Saturday and it’s one of those occasions when we’re grateful to have access to the indoor facility at the Regional Performance Centre.“It was a good session, which kept us ticking over for Tuesday night, and there were actually positives to the game going off.“Dave watched Alloa and Ayr on Saturday afternoon and Jimmy went to Dunfermline against Dundee United, which was obviously useful for the days ahead in terms of preparation.“So there’s frustration but we took the good side of it, too.”Meanwhile, James reacted to news of the club’s latest financial figures.The Dark Blues revealed losses of £. million at teatime on Friday – more than four times greater than the previous year’s deficit .The figures show how heavily the cost of relegation has hit Dundee in the pocket, with squad and managerial churn blamed for much of the club’s increased expenditure.Financial predictions for next year are also bleak.But the club’s majority shareholder – Tim Keyes and John Nelms’ Football Partners Scotland– have committed, in a statement released alongside the accounts, to continue providing funds.For the manager, who has enjoyed daily support from Nelms, that came as no surprise.But McPake remains aware of the pressing need toas quickly as possible to the Premiership, given the havoc dropping into the Championship has wreaked on the club’s balance sheet.“Some of it I can’t control but the bit of it I can control is the budget I’ve been given,” he said.“Regardless of what  has been going on and wherever  money has been needed, the owners have backed me from start to finish.“I have absolutely no complaints on that front. That has been the same for every other manager they have employed here – they’ve all been backed.“What we can do on the playing side is, as I’ve said before, make sure come April, May time, we’ve given ourselves the best possible chance of getting back to the Premiership.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"where should johns scrapbook rest","story":"Lochgelly resident Gary Lister got in touch regarding his late father.John Lister died in  and was one of the last remaining members of the great St Andrews United side which won the Scottish Junior Cup  years ago in .Gary, , said: “My father was very well known in Fe junior circles as, in addition to playing in that great St Andrews United side, he also had spells with other clubs such as Steelend Vics, Lochore Welfare, Newburgh, Valleyfield Colliery, Dunfermline Jubilee, Lochgelly Albert and Halbeath.“Indeed, he played as a goalkeeper at that level from  to .“My father, who worked as a blacksmith at Rosyth docks, turned out  times for St Andrews, which included a run of  consecutive appearances.”The main reason for Gary getting in touch was his father’s scrapbooks and he continued: “I have three scrapbooks, photos, cuttings, articles from The Courier, Saturday pink paper, yellow paper, Sunday Post.“They are all just tucked away in a drawer.“What I’m looking for is some place to put them on display so others may be able to enjoy them.

areas that can be improved in a bid to make the region thrive.As part of this, land is earmarked for developments or ring-fenced for community use.Four towns have been identied as potential regeneration areas, with work being proposed to improve Macduff, Banff, Peterhead and Fraserburgh using local partnerships in each place.In Banff, a comprehensive action programme has been developed which includes promoting the town’s harbour and marina and supporting existing and new businesses in the town centre.Lower Banff is also in line for regeneration as redundant properties there will be brought back into use by being advertised.Duff House Gardens has been protected from any property development along with the historic Duff House Royal golf course.Banff and District councillor John Cox hopes these plans will encourage more people to come to the town.He said: “Hopefully this will be transformative to encourage further investment, not just in buildings but creating an infrastructure to support employment opportunities, manufacturers and increasing the local wage economy.”For Macduff, the popular aquarium will be invested in to draw more tourists in through developer contributions.A network of walking and cycling routes have also been identied to link Macduff and Banff and help improve connectivity around the north-east.Land south of Corskie Drive has been allocated for housing development to expand the settlement westwards.However, the report states it is essential “to retain separation of Macduff from Banff to ensure local identity is maintained”.In Fraserburgh the plan focuses on protecting the fishing heritage and sport and recreation in the area.Saltoun Gardens, playing fields, tennis courts, bowling green, putting green, play areas and the cricket ground will all be protected from development.Councillors will discuss these proposals tomorrow."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/02/ee-jri-240220-01-004_34866167-446x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet floyd caesar and archie are

From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"mr-roland-brett---appreciation","story":"THE business and sporting communities of the Scottish Borders have lost one of their leading lights following the death on February  of RolandBrett. He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles. Both my children called me separately to tell me there was a signicant fire at the High School, said Gareth.ldquoI could see the smoke from where I was in Peebles and made my way to the school.As the fire ripped through the building, Gareth captured events as they unfolded and wired them out to the national newspapers.He said: ldquoSending images to national newspapers of ongoing news stories was part of my everyday working le up until around  when I stopped working as a press photographer.\"Since then I have concentrated on commercial and editorial work.As firefighters worked tirelessly into the wee hours tackling the blaze, Gareth pictured the devastation and produced some harrowing images of Novemberrsquos fire.The following day the photographs were picked up and used by five national newspapers ndash The Scotsman, The Daily Star, The Sun, The Daily Record, and the Express.But Gareth wasnrsquot just a photographer taking sought after horric images for the media, he is also a parent of pupils at the school and felt emotionally invested.ldquoMy daughter Olivia is in th year and is presently studying for her Higher Photography. She was clearly affected by the fire and distraught by the damage the fire had caused to the Art department and the loss of the schoolrsquos valuable photography equipment.It was then Gareth knew his next picture would be a happy one, only it wouldnrsquot be taken by him.ldquoI decided that I would use the revenue generated from the publication of my images of the fire to the benefit of Peebles High School. The community spirit in Peebles and the wider Tweed Valley has been impressive since the fire.ldquoItrsquos an absolute pleasure to be able to fund the purchase of a new Canon Digital SLR camera and present it to the school.\"I hope it goes a small way to assisting the present and future photography and art students at Peebles High School in completing their coursework and moving onto greater things.As well as cameras, the schoolrsquos Art department lost its entire studio lightening in the fire and Gareth hopes his act of kindness will inspire others to help where they can.ldquoIt has been truly inspiring to watch the community come together. Businesses and iniduals have been selfless in their generosity to the school and I hope that continues.ldquoMy passion is of course photography and I hope my small contribution will encourage others to continue to assist Peebles High School as it continues to rebuild after the fire in November.Rector of Peebles High School Campbell Wilson, told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoThe fire in November was a tragedy for our school. Our resilience and ability to overcome our challenges is only possible because of the tremendous community support we have received. This is yet another in a long list of kindnesses that help us to recover, grow and look to the future with optimism.

It was amazing to have so many people wanting to attend and, in the end, we could have sold it out nearly three times over.

ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my childrsquos school being closed You have the right to reasonable time off to deal with unexpected disruptions relating to the care of your child this includes incidents relating to your childrsquos school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period has

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin.

Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions.

In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power.

She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

Itrsquos that containment measures and closures ndash should they prove necessary ndash create practical headaches, too shutting a school, for example, will almost certainly take out of action a lot of healthcare workers, as would public transport restrictions.If it turns out that widespread ldquoself-isolation becomes necessary, it will obviously have a huge impact on such frontline services, and on sectors such as retail, logistics and hospitality.A lot of other parts of the economy, however, may be surprisingly resilient. Itrsquos dficult to find out how many of those employed in the UK would be ableto work from home, but itrsquos likely to be a fair number. Most people who spend the majority of their time on a computer and telephone ndash which must be a signicant proportion of the workforce ndash could as easily do that at home.Managers, professionals, administrative and secretarial workers are more than  per cent of all those employed not all of them will be able to do everything remotely, but five years ago, more than  per cent of the UK workforceworked almost exclusively from home. At that stage, it was estimated that half the UK workforce would work remotely by .That obviously isnrsquot the case, and I donrsquot suppose that anyone would regard it as a vindication of the predictionit were to happen this year, but only as a result of a pandemic that had us all quarantined in our bedrooms, checking in with the office on Skype, Slack or Microsoft Teams.But given we have such tools for security, video-conferencing, multi-user messaging and real-time supervision, itrsquos rather odd that ldquotelecommuting hasnrsquot become the default for more jobs. With the exception of a few industries, remote working tends to be something that, for those who do it at all, is confined to a day or two a week, rather than the norm.Yet, as well as the obvious savings for employers in providing office space, as well as ancillary costs , all the research suggests that those who work mainly from home are more productive, motivated and happier. The advantages arenrsquot just flexibility in work le balance or quality of living there are real material advantages in commuting and housing costs ndash especially for those who live outside major cities.We should be using the necessity for such measures during our current dficulties to overcome the resistance to introducing this kind of model much more widely. Think, for example, of the boon for meeting climate targets,we could take a few million daily commuters out of the equation, and the likely geographical redistribution of skilled work and income.Imagine the savings in care costs that would be produced with a more flexible workforce, the boost to small businesses and local high streetspeople popped out from home, on foot or by bicycle, for their errands, rather than concentrating their spending around office blocks in city centres.If it comes to that, it could have a profound impact on housing, one of the great distortions in the economy, by allowing the repurposing of city centre offices for accommodation, while offering those who prefer the country or the suburbs the ability to work there instead.

will help inspire the Sir David Attenboroughs of the future.The worldrsquos biggest gannet colony can be found on Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, with over , birds swarming every inch of the island during the breeding season.They travel south for the winter, many as far as the coast of West Africa.Over a dozen have already made their way to the ft high, steep-sided volcanic rock in North Berwick, marking the start of a mass arrival which is seen as a major event in the breeding season.It is a particularly welcome sight given growing fears over falling seabird populations.In December  a University of Aberdeen study found that marine species are the most at risk due to competition they face from the fishing industry for food.Researchers found there had been a  per cent drop in populations as a result of fishing , pollution and habitat destruction.Other experts fear that one possible cause of the decrease is that waters around the UK have increased in temperature by more than C thanks to global warming.In the wake of this change, seas have also seen a dramatic loss of zooplankton while sand eels ndash a critically important source of food for many birds ndash have disappeared from many parts of the Atlantic.However, the gannet has been increasing in number at roughly two per cent a year since the early s.Some experts believe this trendbucking growth is largely thanks to their extensive feeding range.The birds are known to fly in excess of  miles in search of food.Experts who monitor the colonies also believe the gannetsrsquo resilience is because they are adaptable in what they eat and so rarely encounter food shortages.Maggie Sheddan, Bass Rock guide for the Scottish Seabird Centre, said: ldquoAt this time of year we begin to see the gannets circling Bass Rock in small numbers and waiting for their partners to .ldquoBy the end of the month, weather dependent, we hope to see thousands vying for nesting sites on the island.ldquoThis sighting is a signicant milestone in the start of the breeding season on the Firth of Forth islands.The Scottish Seabird Centrersquos interactive live cameras are located on the Firth of Forth islands, including the Bass Rock. From the centrersquos interactive Discovery Experience attraction in North Berwick, visitors will be able to take control of the cameras for themselves to observe the fascinating behaviour of the Northern Gannet colony.The new cameras replace outdated devices on the island and will provide much clearer images of the arearsquos marine wildle.Visitors to the centre can also use them to zoom in on animals without causing disturbance.Mal Watson, science communication at the Scottish Seabird Centre, said: ldquoThe sight of thousands of gannets nesting on Bass Rock is always amazing to witness ndash even for those who have worked here for many years.The first records of gannets on the Bass Rock date back to the th century. As Britainrsquos largest seabird, they have a wing span of over ft, e at speeds of up to mph and can live for over  years.Researchers at the University of Glasgow discovered that travelling as part of a flock appeared to be about more than just gaining aerodynamic benefits.The more experienced adult birds were often found at the front of commuting flocks, the younger birds following behind.The results add weight to the theory that young gannets learn to hunt by following their elders, with knowledge of the best feeding grounds passed down from generation to generation.Bass Rock, formed  million years ago from an old volcano, has been owned by the Hamilton-Dalrymple family for the last  years.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So two lots have gone up, another lot is with the Parliamentary authorities as of today, Irsquom following the rules.While not saying who his biggest donors are, he did, however, say that the biggest donation he has received was pound, from fellow lawyer Robert Latham, which was published on Parliamentrsquos register of interests on Tuesday.Askedshe thinks Sir Keir is hiding something, Ms Long-Bailey said that ldquoI hope not.ldquoBut I think itrsquos fair to expect all leadership candidates to be transparent, come under scrutiny, because we will do as leader of the party and indeed as prime minister, so we should be as open as possible to show where our donations come from, she added.ldquoItrsquos important to do that because therersquos always an assumption that you donrsquot get something for nothing in this world and those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future. vw,vw,px, px\"Rebecca Long-Bailey is shadow business secretary Ms Long-Bailey was subjected to her own grilling by the veteran journalist, during which she declined to revise her   rating of Mr Corbyn, saying ldquoitrsquos not Top Trumps.The shadow business secretary insisted she is not the ldquocontinuity Corbyn candidate which some cast her as, dismissing claims she is the outgoing leader in a dferent wrapper.ldquoItrsquos not the same old chocolate Corbyn bar, she said, before being grilled on the anti-Semitism that has blighted the Labour Party.She admitted regretting not directly challenging a member at a recent event in Liverpool who claimed ldquomembers of the Israeli lobby including Jewish Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge had the greatest responsibility for preventing Mr Corbyn from becoming prime minister.ldquoIn my response I thought at the time that I had been implicit in explaining why this particular gentleman was wrong but with retrospect I shouldrsquove called that out directly because it was anti-Semitic, she said.ldquoI should have challenged that specic element of that gentlemanrsquos contribution directly and I wish I had done that because it was an anti-Semitic statement to make.Sir Keir continued to decline directly criticising Mr Corbyn, who led Labour to its worst general election defeat since  but is still revered by some members who will choose the next leader.But he did not deny that he was ldquoappalled by the awfulness of the outgoing leader, as has been claimed by Labour peer Lord Falconer.And Sir Keir said it was ldquoutter nonsense that he had undermined Mr Corbyn by not towing the leaderrsquos line when he said he would campaign to remain in any further EU referendum. vw,vw,px, px\"Lisa Nandy The final leadership contender, Lisa Nandy, subjected herself to Mr Neilrsquos scrutiny in January.Members and supporters began receiving ballots on February .Voting closes two days before the new leader is announced on April .copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"advertising sales representative full and part time at the shetland times ","story":"The Shetland Times Ltd is looking for a bright, enthusiastic and energetic advertising sales representative who must be a team player.This is a full-time post,  hours per week, am-pm Monday-Thursday, am-pm Friday.It is an opportunity to sell our range of promotional packages to current clients and prospective customers.As a part of our sales team you will meet clients face to face on a regular basis as well as make telephone sales calls.You will play a key role in selling and administering advertising and promotional offers.and is capable of meeting ious publication deadlines.A good understanding of Microsoft Office suite, keyboard skills and high levels of literacy and spelling are expected.Marketing sales experience would be an advantage.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm. Tickets are priced at £. and are available online at www.eventbrite"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

There#s nothing to be found.Not a single pharmacy had any in stock, with one pharmacist saying she#s never seen demand like it in  years behind the counter.Already the shelves are bare in the high street chemist stores.Across the UK, Boots limited sales to two per customer last week as the panic-buying set in - but the entire product range remains out of stock across the country.A quick check on their website and the messages range from #sorry temporarily out of stock# to #stock sold out# or #stock coming soon#.We#ve found hand sanitiser incredibly dficult to source. We were promised a supply last week and it arrived on Monday, but we didn#t even get them out of the box before they were gone Paul McKenna, Loughview PharmacyIn Belfast, you#ll not have any better luck around the local pharmacies, as several hours attempting to buy a single bottle of hand sanitiser proved an impossible task.It#s crazy, said pharmacist Paul McKenna at Loughview Pharmacy near Stranmillis.We#ve found hand sanitiser incredibly dficult to source. We were promised a supply last week and it arrived on Monday, but we didn#t even get them out of the box before they were gone.

Figures released to the student newspaper The Scoop show that more than , applied to the Student Hardship and Student Support funds, which typically award up to £ in the form of a non-repayable loan for those in financial dficulty.It also shows  students who applied to the fund in the academic year   were rejected.Alliance councillor for Lagan River and former QUB student Eoin Tennyson said the money could be a critical leline for some.Finance can be a source of huge pressure and anxiety for students, with an increasing number of hidden costs and challenges facing those at university, he said.Student support and hardship funds provide a critical leline in times of financial dficulty, and it is imperative that students are able to access these funds as and when required. With increasing accommodation and transport costs, and growing challenges surrounding student poverty and mental health, these figures make for stark reading. I would urge the Department of Economy and Queen’s University to review the process and ensure students get the necessary support.While the number of students applying to the fund rose by .% over the past four years, the number approved increased by just .%. The application for financial assistance asks for details of loans, expenses and exceptional costs, as well as a personal statement explaining why the applicant is in financial dficult and why their situation merits additional support. Priority is given to mature students whoseto university has caused them financial hardship, lone parents not in receipt of childcare grants or disabled students# allowance and those from low income families or those caring for a relative or who are homeless. The number of students rejected has risen by .% since  . More than one in five applicantswas rejected in the   year.Speaking to The Scoop, Student#s Union vice president welfare officer, Ciaran O’Brien, said: It#s not surprising that more and more students are applying for the hardship fund. As the welfare officer I sit on the Hardship Fund Committee, and at my first meeting during almost mid-way through the first semester of this academic year it was remarked that those processing the applications were receiving on average almost  a day.More money is clearly needed for the fund, he said. VP education officer Jason Bunting added: This worrying rise in applications demonstrates the acute financial pressures student face, which have a major impact on poor mental health. The fact that so many students are making applications also demonstrates that our university is still inaccessible to working class young people. It is time that QUB took urgent action and ensure university is accessible for everyone.NUS-USI President Robert Murtagh said: Increasing numbers of students applying to the student hardship fund is, unfortunately, not surprising. As rent, transport, food and the general cost of living have continued to rise, student maintenance loans and grants have remained static, meaning many students cannot afford to make ends meet.Queen’s University Belfast and the Department for the Economy have been asked for a comment.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNorthern IrelandTUV#s Jim Allister urges Queen#s University to improve relations with unionist communityTUV leader Jim Allister has expressed concern over the election of the new president of the Students# Union at Queen#s University Belfast.EducationQueen#s still reigns as NI#s top university in Times listQueen#s University remains the best university in Northern Ireland, according to an influential list.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLarne tragedy: Inside the family home with picture perfect views where the unimaginable happenedCoronavirus outbreak: Northern Ireland holidaymakersfrom Spain after being quarantined for two weeksBBC#s Stephen Nolan puts Twitter trolls #who should know better# on notice he will fight backReport confirms UDR members and MI linked to murders at Boyle#s Bar in Tyrone, says solicitorOff-duty officer#s bid to arrest boy over snowball incident in Northern Ireland probed by Ombudsman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.”Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed.“It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!“I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble.“I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above.There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

McDonagh admitted that the win was important for team morale.“Our first win of the season means it gives us a wee bit of confidence going into the Waterford, so yeah it was important to win,” he said. “We have got a bit of confidence now and I know all the boys will be looking forward to the Waterford match.“We’ll be going there looking to exploit them and get three points again, because that feeling of getting three points against Bohs is special and we want to get as many points as possible.”The importance of keeping a clean sheet was not lost on the Derry City players, particularly after two scoreless draws between the club last season.“Whenever we came in at half-time the manager talked about making sure we keep a clean-sheet,” McDonagh continued. “Obviously we felt comfortable in the first half and knew that we were doing quite well and knew that we just needed to get that goal and keep a clean-sheet.“If you keep a clean-sheet in this league you have a good chance in winning games, so we done that and that’s credit to the back-four and everyone as a whole, but as I said keeping clean-sheets are ideal. “It will stand us in good stead and we’ll be looking to keep this momentum going and hopefully we can get a few more clean-sheets, because I’m sure we have got the players to win us more games.” googletag.cmd.push ImportantMcDonagh heaped praise on goal scorer Stephen Mallon, who made a memorable contribution on his first start for the club.“That’s why Stevie was brought to the club and we see that in training every day and that’s why he was given his chance,” he explained.“It’s important in those close games that we take our chances and Stevie did that tonight. It was a bit of magic from him and it’s a great goal from him. I think it was important to get up and running and get the three points, as it will do the team a world of good.”McDonagh is now hoping that the Candystripes can build on the momentum from Friday, both inidually and collectively.“There were a lot of good performances and we looked solid at the back and the whole team collectively you could see we are starting to come together, things are starting to work and we can only get better from now,” he stated. “Waltergetting his goal will also do him the world of good as well and it’s good to get two dferent goalscorers and it will give the boys confidence.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair.

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it.

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
