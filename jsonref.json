With today\u0027s measures added on, looking at a grand total of \u0026pound190bn so far...Here is how much these measures could cost - up to \u0026pound30billion.\u0026nbspStamp duty cut will potentially cost the Treasury \u0026pound3.8billion. Job Retention Scheme - \u0026pound9.4billion.The Eat Out to Help Out Scheme? \u0026pound500million. The VAT cut for hospitality and some parts of the travel industry is \u0026pound4.1billion.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNo help for shops...The British Independent Retailers Association has expressed its disappointment that there is no direct help for retail business owners.Andrew Goodacre, Bira\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027We welcome the various initiatives to bring younger people into work and the support for the hospitality sector.\u0027However, it is disappointing that there is no VAT cut for retailers in general and no changes to national insurance.\u0027There needs to be thought given to how consumer demand is stimulated on the high street or many businesses will close and jobs lost.\u0027Things that didn\u0027t happen...The pensions triple lock is safe for now.There is no car scrappage scheme to help the motor industry.Help for the self-employed who have slipped through the cracks.\u0026nbspTax experts Blick Rothenberg say:\u0026nbsp\u0027It is headline-grabbing stuff. But evidence from previous stamp duty holidays shows that it is unlikely to increase sales volumes and will merely bring them forward.\u0027The end of the holiday was expected to coincide with a significant fall in the market.\u0027That would have made the fall even greater. It is good, therefore, that the holiday is longer than expected at eight months. But even eight months will be too short unless there really is a V shaped recovery.\u0027Those moving in London and the South East will benefit by up to \u0026pound15,000 but are likely to have to pay some tax due to the significantly higher property values in these regions.\u0027It says a typical home sale in the capital is \u0026pound540,000 - the stamp duty will be \u0026pound2,000, as opposed to \u0026pound17,000.\u0026nbspShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Labour acknowledge that the Government has had to make big decisions.Ms Dodds said: \u0027The Government has had to take big decisions too, we acknowledge that, but today should have been the day when our Government chose to build a bridge between what has been done so far and what needs to be done to get out economy moving again.\u0027Relatively short statement, stamp duty cut, Job Retention Scheme, Kickstart Scheme, green homes vouchers, cheap restaurant eats for August and VAT cut for some are the key policies here.Eat Out, to Help OutHere are measures to help get customers back into restaurants, cafes and pubs.\u0027I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an Eat Out to Help Out,\u0027 Rishi says.\u0027Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50 per cent off, up to a maximum discount of \u0026pound10 per head for everyone, including children. Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday.\u0027Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days.\u0027So, essentially, it is like being in the Tastecard scheme - but without needing to sign up for a free trial. Will it encourage people to eat out next month?VAT cut for some sectorsThe Chancellor wants to see pubs, restaurants, cafes and B\u0026ampBs \u0027bustling again,\u0027 telling MPs: \u0027At the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at 20 per cent\u0027I\u0027ve decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.\u0027VAT will be reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent from 15 July until 12 January to help, noting: \u0027This is a \u0026pound4billion catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors, benefiting over 150,000 businesses, and consumers everywhere - all helping to protect 2.4million jobs.\u0027No surprise, but the stamp duty cut is officially revealed. No stamp duty for homes under \u0026pound500,000. Will run to 31 March 2021 - longer than expected.\u0026nbspThe average bill will fall \u0026pound4,500 and it will help nine in 10 buyers he says. Effective immediately.\u0026nbspRishi Sunak said property transactions fell by 50 per cent in May and house prices have fallen for the first time in eight years.Chris Scott, 37, from Hampshire said all parties in his chain are ready to exchange, but were waiting for this announcement.\u0027We were due to exchange last Friday but was all delayed... until today!\u0027 Mr Scott told the PA news agency.\u0027Everyone in the chain woke to the potential news today and everyone is ready to now exchange, then move Friday. But we are waiting until after the announcement at lunchtime.\u0027If the announcement is of an instant freeze we personally will save \u0026pound7,400, and I know further up the chain will save more.\u0027As previously revealed, the Chancellor is creating a green jobs plan to \u0027save money, cut carbon and create jobs.\u0027\u0026pound2billion will be available for home upgrade to make them greener.\u0026nbspHommeowners and landlords in England will be able to apply for vouchers for the scheme\u0026nbspthis year to pay for green improvements such as loft, wall and floor insulation that could save some households hundreds of pounds a year on their energy bills while creating thousands of jobs for tradespeople, the Treasury says.\u0026nbspA further \u0026pound1billion programme will make public buildings, including schools and hospitals, greener, helping the country meet its ambitions of achieving Net Zero by 2050, whilst investing in our future prosperity, it adds.Suggests it will create 140,000 green jobs.The Chancellor announced a programme to give young people the \u0026lsquobest possible chance\u0026rsquo of getting a job.Government will pay employers to create new jobs for 16-24 year-olds. But they have to be good quality jobs, with a minimum of 25 hours per week at national minimum wage.Government will pay the wages and extra for overheads.Furthermore, the Chancellor says traineeships are a proven scheme to get young people ready for work.\u0027We know they work, so for the first time ever we\u0026rsquoll pay employers \u0026pound1,000 to take on trainees, with triple the number of places.\u0027Stand by your workersIf companies bring back someone who was furloughed - and continuously employ them through to January - the Government will pay a Job Retention Bonus of \u0026pound1,000 per person.\u0027It\u0027s vital people aren\u0027t just returning for the sake of it - they need to be doing decent work.\u0027So for businesses to get the bonus, the employee must be paid at least \u0026pound520 on average, in each month from November to the end of January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in national insurance.\u0027The Chancellor said if employers bring back all nine million people who have been on furlough then it would be a \u0026pound9billion policy.He added: \u0027Our message to business is clear: if you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.\u0027Rishi Sunak shuts down any potential of the scheme being extended beyond October. Will be criticised no matter what he does, he says.\u0027It will wind down gradually and flexibly until then,\u0027 he says.\u0026nbspRishi Sunak says: \u0027People need to know that we will do all we can to give everyone the opportunity of good and\u0026nbspsecure work.\u0027The most urgent challenge is the looming \u0027huge job losses.\u0027\u0027We face profound economic challenges - the IMF predicts deepest recession since records began,\u0027 he adds.He goes on to say that the economy has contracted by 25 per cent in two months - the same amount it grew in the last 18 years.\u0027And the independent OBR and Bank of England are both projecting significant job losses - the most urgent challenge we now face.Here we go...Support for young peopleTory MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown at PMQs called for support for young people hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak.He said: \u0027The coronavirus has hit young people in work and those about to enter the jobs market particularly hard.\u0027Would my right honourable (friend) therefore continue to build on his excellent package of announcements, so far as our young people have hope and\u0026nbspencouragement for the very best prospects at the start of their working life?\u0027Responding Boris Johnson said: \u0027We want young people to have the self-confidence and the experience of work to keep learning on the job and to get the jobs that they need, and if you wait just a few minutes you\u0027ll be hearing rather more from my right honourable friend the Chancellor about that very matter.\u0027Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the furlough scheme \u0027cannot go on forever.\u0027SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to be extended to support the \u0027hardest hit sectors\u0027 to prevent a spike in unemployment.During PMQs, Mr Johnson replied: \u0027I think, and I know a lot of people in this House would agree with me, I think that you cannot go on forever with a furlough scheme that keeps people, keeps employees, in suspended animation in the way that it does.\u0027We need to get our economy moving again that\u0027s what I think the people of this country want to see in a sustainable and cautious way.\u0027A short video from Rishi Sunak and a reminder of the measures it set out earlier in the year.\u0026nbspWas Saturday so \u0027super\u0027?Consumers in England put their hands in their pockets over the weekend as spending on pubs and hairdressers came roaring back on Super Saturday - but spending is nowhere near normal levels, reports George Nixon.As George says, eyes will be on what Rishi Sunak has lined up for the hospitality industry as many are still simply put off of non-essential trips and spending.Below, Labour leader Keir Starmer enjoys a pint in London on Monday:\u0026nbspThe Chancellor may announce a temporary or even permanent axing of the state pension triple lock today, but financial experts believe he is more likely to wait until autumn, if he dares to do it at all, writes pensions reporter Tanya Jefferies.There is strong speculation the Government will abandon its manifesto promise to keep the popular guarantee, to help pay the gargantuan bill for fighting the coronavirus crisis, but this would unleash fury among its elderly voters.The \u0027triple lock\u0027 guarantee on annual rises in the state pension means they are decided by whatever is the highest of price inflation, average earnings growth or 2.5 per cent.In April, elderly people got a bumper near-4 per cent rise in the full new state pension to \u0026pound175.20 per week, or to \u0026pound134.25 if they are on the old basic rate. It was set to match the rise in average earnings recorded last July.Removing the triple lock could save the Treasury around \u0026pound4billion a year.Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, says: \u0027The triple lock was set in a very different pre Covid-19 age when price and earnings growth tended to be relatively stable year on year.\u0027Blindly following that formula now as we move through and out of the coronavirus crisis with huge distortions to average earnings expected could create bizarre results which were never intended and which would fail any test of intergenerational fairness.\u0027If as a result of the furlough scheme we see a sharp dip in average earnings this year followed by a quick and full recovery the next, the triple lock would still grant pensioners a 2.5 per cent minimum increase next year and potentially put them on track for a double digit increase in 2022, while those of working age might have simply regained their pre Covid-19 earnings.\u0027The Chancellor will have to make a call as to whether to suspend the earnings related element or perhaps adjust it to smooth out sharp fluctuations or to make a more fundamental change, with some people viewing it as overly generous.\u0027A quick reminder that Rishi Sunak only became Chancellor on\u0026nbsp13 February 2020.It came after Sajid\u0026nbspJavid reportedly fell out with Boris Johnson\u0027s most senior adviser Dominic Cummings, after resisting plans to increase borrowing.He was viewed as a traditional Conservative chancellor, focused more on balancing the books than on delivering some of the bold changes envisioned by Cummings and the Prime Minister.He was the second youngest Chancellor to undertake the Budget speech since George Osborne in 2010 earlier in the year.\u0026nbspHe was born in Southampton and has been MP for Richmond, Yorkshire, since 2014 - the seat previously held by William Hague.He is GP\u0027s son who married an Indian tech billionaire\u0027s daughter and built a multi million-pound fortune that saw him dubbed the \u0027Maharaja of the Dales\u0027A graduate of \u0026pound42,000-per-year Winchester College and Oxford University, where he studied PPE, he is believed to be one of the richest members of Parliament, and lives with his family in a magnificent Georgian manor house in the small village of Kirby Sigston, just outside Northallerton in North Yorkshire.A multi-millionaire in his own right thanks to his investment career, Mr Sunak was known to be close to his former boss Sajid Javid, with the pair joining each other on nights out and sharing Star Wars jokes on Twitter.\u0026nbspHis Instagram account depicts a sport-loving family man who dotes on the two daughters he shares with his wife,\u0026nbspAkshata Murthy, whose father N.R. Narayana Murthy is India\u0027s sixth-wealthiest man thanks to his ownership of multinational business technology giant\u0026nbspInfosys.\u0026nbspChancellors are never ones to shy away from a good photo opportunity - often grinning manically with that little red box.Earlier in the year, Rishi posted a photograph on his Twitter account with a huge bag of Yorkshire Tea as he made a brew.This time around? He has posed looking over the documents with a \u0026pound180 \u0027smart\u0027 cup on his desk. What has he got brewing today...Property expert Henry Pryor has this to say on social media site Twitter...The markets are relatively flat at the moment, but that could all be in anticipation as to what measures are announced today.For example, if the stamp duty holiday is confirmed, it could benefit the housebuilding sector. A VAT cut on tourism could help travel-related stocks.AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said: \u0027The FTSE 100 started off sharply lower before yo-yoing back to near parity in early trading.\u0027The market\u0027s apparent indecision is understandable when you consider it has to balance the ongoing risks from coronavirus with the willingness of governments and central banks to prop up the global economy.\u0027In the UK there will be focus on Chancellor Rishi Sunak\u0027s mini-Budget, with expectations high after lots of trailers in the media suggesting the announcement will contain blockbuster measures to boost the recovery from lockdown.\u0027Another immediate change could be a cut in employer National Insurance for employers to encourage them taking on new staff.Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, says: \u0027A cut in employer NI would reduce costs for employers and prove a welcome boost to employment.\u0027There are some pension implications to consider because where an employer pays a contribution to an employee\u0026rsquos pension, they don\u0026rsquot pay National Insurance.This has led to some employers offering \u0026lsquosalary sacrifice\u0026rsquo arrangements where employees agree to a pay cut in return for a greater employer pension contribution, with the employer passing on their NI saving to the employee.\u0027If employer NI rates fall, they\u0026rsquoll make less saving on their pension contributions making salary sacrifice arrangements less attractive for them.\u0027Approximately 230,000 of Britain\u0027s self-employed continue to be excluded from any Government support because they have had trading profits of \u0026pound50,000 or more in the last three years.\u0026nbspCampaigners are calling on the Chancellor to step in and remove their exclusion from the Self Employment Income Support Scheme, when he makes a summer statement to the House of Commons tomorrow.There are hundreds of thousands of sole traders that have not had any income since March, whereas employees on the furlough scheme can get up to \u0026pound2,500 per month even if they earn more than \u0026pound50,000 a year.From plumbers to dentists, photographers to therapists, we spoke to some of those affected who have paid plenty of income tax in recent years, but now feel penalised while employees in a similar position are helped out.Will there be further measures announced today? Reporter Jayna Rana looks at the mounting pressure the Chancellor faces to help \u0027forgotten\u0027 self-employed whose incomes have all but disappeared.Could you save £15,000 on buying a home?As mentioned below, the stamp duty cut looks likely and it could mean homebuyers may save up to \u0026pound15,000 buying a home.There will be plenty of people awaiting this announcement - especially those in the midst of buying.\u0026nbspProperty reporter Myra Butterworth looks at the towns where homebuyers would benefit the most from a stamp duty cut.It has been suggested that \u0026pound500 should be given to adults and \u0026pound250 to children to spend in shops that have been hit the worst by the Covid-19 pandemic.The proposal, put forward by economic think-tank Resolution Foundation, involves the delivery of up to \u0026pound30billion worth of vouchers for households to spend in stores, as well as on hospitality and leisure.It is commonly described\u0026nbspby economists as \u0027helicopter money\u0027: airlifting cash into the streets.However, it is costly. Giving \u0026pound100 each person would would cost \u0026pound6.7billion, while Steve Donz\u0026eacute, senior strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said all 27.8million UK households should be handed a \u0026pound1,000 cheque from the Bank of England. That would cost \u0026pound27.8billion.Reporter George Nixon took a look over the weekend:\u0026nbspThe ideas to get Britain to spend its way to a V-shaped coronavirus recoveryThe Government is worried about a potential rise in youth unemployment and will reveal its\u0026nbspKickstart scheme, which will run until at least the end of 2021 and open to people aged 16 to 24 who are claiming Universal Credit.\u0026nbspThey will receive the minimum wage, paid by the state, to work 25 hours a week.

Retailers including Next and Asos have removed all Boohoo clothing from sale, pending investigations.Boohoo, which owns brands including Pretty Little Thing and Nasty Gal, said the review would be led by Alison Levitt QC, the former head of Mishcon de Reya’s white collar crime unit, and said it would initially invest £10m towards “eradicating malpractice” in its supply chain.As part of the plan, it is understood that the company is considering setting up its own factory in Leicester to demonstrate best practice.The company said in a statement that the board was “shocked and appalled by the recent allegations” and was committed to working to rebuild the reputation of textile manufacturing in Leicester.The Boohoo group chief executive, John Lyttle, said the board was taking the matters seriously, adding: “We will not hesitate to terminate any relationships where noncompliance with our code of conduct is found.”City analysts welcomed Boohoo’s move, with Wayne Brown at Liberum saying the company’s response “should start to help rebuild confidence that Boohoo intends to do the right things”.He wrote in a note: “While serious questions will remain for some time, today is the first positive step forward in transparency.” Boohoo will provide an update from its supply chain review in September, when it publishes its half-year results, and further updates are due in January 2021.The group will also launch an independent third-party supply chain review, to be carried out by the ethical audit and compliance specialists Verisio and Bureau Veritas.Boohoo said it had begun to investigate allegations of worker mistreatment as soon as it was made aware of them.It said the company named in this weekend’s Sunday Times report was not and had never been a supplier. It said that to date it had not found any evidence of suppliers paying workers £3.50 an hour, or less than the current legal minimum wage of £8.72 for those aged 25 and over.However, Boohoo said it had found evidence that two suppliers had failed to comply with its code of conduct and Boohoo has terminated its relationships with both of those firms.Boohoo had previously strongly denied any responsibility for the alleged bad practices of its Leicester suppliers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c68d4c3677e44da43caefdd096ccdab2e975c34b/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ae9fe72e422a8216a1dcab0ccf2266","title":"the future of food inside the worlds largest urban farm built on a rooftop","story":"In Paris, urban farmers are trying a soil-free approach to agriculture that uses less space and fewer resources. Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?On top of a striking new exhibition hall in the southern 15th arrondissement of Paris, the world’s largest urban rooftop farm has started to bear fruit. Strawberries, to be precise: small, intensely flavoured and resplendently red.They sprout abundantly from cream-coloured plastic columns. Pluck one out to peer inside and you see the columns are completely hollow, the roots of dozens of strawberry plants dangling into thin air.From identical vertical columns nearby burst row upon row of lettuces near those are aromatic basil, sage and peppermint. Opposite, in narrow, horizontal trays packed not with soil but coco coir (coconut fibre), grow heirloom and cherry tomatoes, shiny aubergines and brightly coloured chards.“It is,” says Pascal Hardy, surveying his domain, “a clean, productive and sustainable model of agriculture that can in time make a real contribution to the resilience – social, economic and also environmental – of the kind of big cities where most of humanity now lives. And look: it really works.”Hardy, an engineer and sustainable development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers – as those soil-free plastic columns are known – on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago.This space is somewhat bigger: 14,000 sq metres, the size (almost exactly) of two football pitches. Coronavirus delayed its opening by a couple of months, but Nature Urbaine, as the operation is called, is now up and running, and has planted roughly a third of the available space.Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 punnets of strawberries. When the remaining two-thirds of the vast rooftop of Paris Expo’s Pavillon 6 are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day.Nature Urbaine is already supplying local residents, who can order fruit and veg boxes online a clutch of nearby hotels a private catering firm that operates 30 company canteens in and around Paris and an airy bar and restaurant, Le Perchoir, which occupies one extremity of the Pavillon 6 rooftop.Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life showcase for the work of Hardy’s flourishing urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding inquiries from around the world – including in the UK, the US and Germany – to design, build and equip a new breed of soil-free inner-city farm.“The method’s advantages are many,” he says. “First, I don’t know about you, but I don’t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases.Produce grown using this soil-free method, on the other hand – which relies solely on a small quantity of water, enriched with organic nutrients, minerals and bacteria, pumped around a closed circuit of pipes, towers and trays – is “produced up here, and sold locally, just down there. It barely travels at all,” Hardy says.“It uses less space. An ordinary intensive farm can grow nine salads per square metre of soil I can grow 50 in a single tower. You can select crop varieties for their flavour, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they’re really at their best, and not before.”Urban farming is not, of course, a new phenomenon. The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, aims eventually to have at least 100 hectares of rooftops, walls and facades covered with greenery – including 30 hectares producing fruit and vegetables. A programme called Les Parisculteurs invites local groups to come up with suitable projects for up to a dozen new sites every year.Inner-city agriculture is booming from Shanghai to Detroit and Tokyo to Bangkok. Strawberries are being grown in disused shipping containers mushrooms in underground carparks. Not all techniques, however, are environmentally friendly: ultra-intensive, 10-storey indoor farms that have sprung up in the US rely on banks of LED lighting and are major consumers of energy, Hardy says.Aeroponic farming, he says, is “virtuous”. The equipment weighs little, can be installed on almost any flat surface, and is cheap to buy: roughly €100 to €150 per sq metre. It is cheap to run, too, consuming a tiny fraction of the electricity used by some techniques.Produce grown this way typically sells at prices that, while generally higher than those of classic intensive agriculture, are lower than soil-based organic growers. In Paris, Nature Urbaine should break even, Hardy estimates, some time next year – a few months later than planned because of the pandemic.There are limits to what farmers can grow this way, of course, and much of the produce is suited to the summer months. “Root vegetables we cannot do, at least not yet,” he says. “Radishes are OK, but carrots, potatoes, that kind of thing – the roots are simply too long. Fruit trees are obviously not an option. And beans tend to take up a lot of space for not much return.”But Agripolis runs a smaller test farm, on top of a gym and swimming pool complex in the 11th arrondissement, where it experiments with new varieties and trials new techniques. A couple of promising varieties of raspberries are soon to make the transition to commercial production.Urban agriculture is not the only development changing the face of farming. As with almost every other sector of the economy, digitisation and new technologies are transforming the way we grow food.Artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things are beginning to revolutionise farming, from driverless, fully automated farm machinery that can sow seeds and fertilise and water soil with maximum precision to systems that monitor exactly how healthy inidual animals are and how much they are producing (a concept known as the “connected cow”).Other AI systems analyse satellite and remote ground sensor data, for example, to monitor plant health, soil condition, temperature and humidity and even to spot potential crop diseases. The technique could help build plant and animal resistance to disease, and reduce waste. For example, with methane known to be a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, research is under way into the stomach bacteria of cows in the hope that tweaking animals’ gut microbes may eventually allow them to produce not just more meat, but also less gas.Urban farming of the kind being practised in Paris is one part of a bigger and fast-changing picture. “Here, we’re really talking about about building resilience, on several levels – a word whose meaning I have come to understand personally,” says Hardy, pointing to the wheelchair he has been forced to use since being injured by a falling tree.“That resilience can be economic: urban farming, hyper-local food production, can plainly provide a measure of relief in an economic crisis. But it is also environmental: boosting the amount of vegetation in our cities will help combat some of the effects of global heating, particularly urban ‘heat islands’.”Done respectfully, and over time, inner-city agriculture can prompt us to think differently both about cities, by breaking down their traditional geography of different zones for working, living and playing, and about agriculture, by bringing food production closer into our lives. “It’s changing paradigms,” says Hardy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5e714fdf3d7d72ca432ac2c623dfe9063fe70bd/0_198_4832_2898/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f63f51e8374e1c712c46601fa597d6c","title":"scottish independence english politics coronavirus brexit","story":"After the coronavirus pandemic and Brexit, the union will not be safe with a prime minister who plays with nationalist fireA virus that doesn’t care about nations or history can still spread borders across the map like a rash. Different European countries’ pandemic responses restored boundaries that were meant to be submerged for the cause of continental integration. That effect was less pronounced within the UK, but public health is a devolved matter, so lockdown has probed the tender line where England meets Scotland.There is no Scottish plan to quarantine visitors from England, but Nicola Sturgeon has refused to dismiss the notion completely. Opining on the subject in parliament last week, Boris Johnson offered the untrue and crass assertion that “there is no such thing as a border” between the two nations. The inane gauntlet was taken up by a handful of pro-independence activists over the weekend, who stood at the sign on the A1 welcoming motorists to Scotland with a banner urging the coronavirus-carrying English to stay away.Sturgeon condemned the stunt as not “sensible or helpful” and no doubt she meant it. The first minister is a nationalist but not an Anglophobe fanatic. Her method for dismantling the union has been to entrench SNP control of devolved institutions until it is hard to distinguish party and state. The pursuit of independence then becomes a settled fact about what it means to be the government of Scotland, thus disqualifying pro-union parties. Anyone who doesn’t want independence has to work harder just to join conversations about Scottishness and the future.It is working. The defeat of the “yes” campaign in a referendum has faded in the historical record more than it should for something that happened only six years ago. That whole world looks hazy now through the volcanic ash of subsequent political eruptions – Brexit, which a majority of Scots opposed, then the pandemic.The coronavirus emergency boosted the standing of incumbents in most countries, but that “rallying to the flag” effect has been stronger and lasted longer in Scotland than in England. Even many of Sturgeon’s critics privately concede that she has had a good crisis, leavening executive authority with humility and sincerity – qualities the Tory leader has only read about. The first minister’s personal ratings have soared, which is doubly remarkable since she began the year looking stale in office and unsettled by charges of sexual assault hanging over Alex Salmond, her predecessor and former mentor. (He was acquitted, but the political wound is still open.)Opinion polls show regular majorities for independence, although that masks a common lack of enthusiasm for re-enacting a referendum battle that ided families and polluted friendships. Sturgeon has to appeal to a mainstream that prefers the rhythm of normal government to the relentless beat of the separatist drum, while at her back is an impatient SNP faction that suspects her of getting too cosy with the status quo.It is a sign of how badly the pro-union side failed to embed its victory that the debate on independence is a three-way tussle between “yes, now”, “yes, later” and “let’s not have this argument”. No party is challenging the SNP for control of Holyrood. Labour’s ambitions are limited to winning back second place from the Tories who have stagnated since losing Ruth Davidson’s leadership.Between now and next May’s Scottish parliament elections, Britain must pass through more Brexit turbulence transitional arrangements expire on 31 December. In every scenario, the SNP then complains that English Tories have wrenched pro-European Scots from their home continent without consent. Barring some unforeseen political accident, Sturgeon will then be confirmed as first minister, arguing that her refreshed mandate compels Westminster to legislate for an independence referendum.Johnson will refuse, thus vindicating the nationalist view that Tory England always represses the will of Scotland. But the prime minister might prefer that charge to a gamble on having his remaining time in office consumed by a battle to save the union, and possibly ending up in posterity as the man who broke the kingdom.Downing Street’s Plan A to dampen the clamour for independence was hosing Scotland with public money, but competition for that resource is getting more intense and areas with Conservative MPs are the priority. If there is no sign of a Tory revival north of the border, an even more cynical path might appeal: letting the flames of resentment roar in Scotland, igniting a Johnson-supporting English nationalist backlash. All the better if that sustains the toxic question of whether Labour needs SNP MPs to support a coalition come a general election. It would take an exceptionally irresponsible prime minister on a streak of constitutional pyromania to pursue such tactics. Johnson is qualified.A conflagration in Scotland might not be the next crisis to destabilise Britain, but it is in the queue. It is also unnerving how little England is prepared, when Scottish politics is a rolling rehearsal. That bodes ill for the pro-union cause. English voters who support neither a Tory government nor Scottish independence have no purchase on a debate that is existential for their country, if that country is identified as the UK. Theirs is the queasiness of the spectator with emotional investment in a contest and no influence on the result. That is how my French and German friends described Brexit, which is disturbing because the comparison feels both apt and ridiculous. There is eerie familiarity in the way the pro-union cause is floundering, but it is madness to imagine a cultural border between England and Scotland analogous to the Channel.But the arguments against separation have atrophied from lack of exercise and the nationalist songs have catchier tunes. The SNP strategy is to make independence feel inevitable. It needn’t be, but ergence is the easier trajectory to plot. Meanwhile, the unionist cause has not evolved beyond hoping Sturgeon is wrong, while deferring the moment of asking Scotland the question directly, which is an admission of fear that she is right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be488fe3677957e92494c9aa57c192b6297322f1/0_344_5175_3106/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f108f2b0ab0e5206f3121d3cc700bfc","title":"halve uk pesticide use to save insects say conservationists","story":"Wildlife Trusts report also calls for expansion of projects such as flower-rich road verges and butterfly reintroductionsThe use of pesticides in the UK must be at least halved to reverse steep losses in insect abundance and boost the natural world that depends on them, according to a report.It warns that insects are the “canaries in the coal mine” of the natural world and that everyone, including the government, local authorities, community groups and iniduals, needs to become insect champions.“If we get it right for insects we get it right for everything else,” said Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex and lead author of the report. “Insects are the canaries in the coal mine: their collapse is an alarm bell that we must not ignore. Action is needed from every section of society.”The UK produced a National Action Plan on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides in 2013 which is now overdue for review. It was described as “woefully weak” by the Pesticides Action Network, as it set no target for reductions.Groups around the UK have been boosting local insect populations, including the On the Verge project in Stirling, which has now worked with more than 100 schools, local councils, churches and care homes to plant new native wildflower areas. Research shows the verge sites have 25 times more flowers and 50 times more bumblebees than adjacent grass areas that were mown.In the London borough of Lambeth the Incredible Edible food project successfully campaigned to end pesticide use. “Our passion is local food, so insects are really important to us,” said Janie Bickersteth, chair of the Lambeth group. “Lambeth has now agreed to go pesticide free by 2021 and has already stopped spraying in all its parks.”The Kent Wildlife Trust and partners have created 146 roadside nature reserves and 13 “bee roads”, which they call insect superhighways and provide forage and refuge for insects. “The landscape in Kent, like much of the UK, has become increasingly fragmented. But our road networks provide a huge opportunity to help address this issue,” said Rosie Bleet, the trust’s bee roads officer.In May, the Manchester argus butterfly was returned to Astley Moss in Greater Manchester for the first time in over 100 years. It was once common across the region, but due to the destruction of its peatland homes, it had become locally extinct.Insect-friendly farming is also highlighted in the report. Jack Kelly, who has 90 acres of mixed farmland in County Down, has used government-funded agri-environment schemes and voluntary work to create a network of flower and seed-rich habitats, with large hedgerows and wetlands. “I’ve always believed that if you look after nature, it will look after you,” he said. “With insect populations plummeting, we must do everything we can to reverse this trend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d1dbccfe03ecb632cd957ff3bea6123aeea284a/106_289_2217_1330/master/2217.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ba887f2a4dbc2c4ced23c7e5842e3903","title":"litigante review franco lolli carolina sanin","story":"A quirk of fate pitches a professionally stressed single mother into an unlikely love affair in an affecting drama from ColombiaThere’s enormous tenderness in this drama of disillusion from Colombian director Franco Lolli – but also an overwhelmingly unsentimental sense of life’s seriousness and painfulness.

But it’s all real, right up to the disclosure of a horribly familiar villain right at the end, whose identity it would be unsporting to reveal.This is the story of the eccentric but charismatic commune leader John P Allen, who ran a collective ranch in New Mexico, where in the 70s he met the rebellious young billionaire Ed Bass, who offered to put some of his family oil money at Allen’s disposal to realise one of his most cherished visions: building a gigantic biodome-style enclosed ecosystem, rather like the one in Douglas Trumbull’s classic sci-fi movie Silent Running. Here, they could conduct a two-year experiment with a group of people living behind glass, tending to the crops and plants.The results of the Biosphere 2 experiment – Biosphere 1 being the Earth itself – would tell us about humanity’s ability to colonise planets using such a dome, and help to rebalance our relationship with the natural world back here on B1.

Inevitably, relations between them frayed. The air quality started to deteriorate. And they had not anticipated what might happen if one of them needed hospital treatment.Yet the real Lord of the Flies meltdown happened afterwards. As a result, Bass called in the Wall Street bankers to evict the hippies and the free-thinkers from the Biosphere management, as part of a mission to repurpose it as a profitably “environmentalist” tourist attraction.The Biosphere 2 project now looks like reality TV, or maybe a conceptual art happening.

Adding potato enables you to remove some fat and provides resistant starch and nutrients such as potassium and vitamin C.

It’s not a million miles away from a cheesecake, but whose is the best recipe? Key lime pie is, like so many regional specialities, very much the product of its environment – in this case, the Florida Keys, a chain of coral islands that trail lazily into the Gulf of Mexico and that were only linked to the US mainland in 1912. This splendid isolation fostered a reliance on local ingredients such as limes and the cans of condensed milk popular in tropical climates before widespread refrigeration. Put the two together, and you have most of a key lime pie.Though it probably dates from the late 19th century, the dish became famous when the tourist industry took off in the Keys following the construction of the Overseas Highway – in a 1948 travel piece on Key West, the Washington Post includes it, along with turtle steaks and black bean soup, as one of the “epicurean pleasures not to be overlooked”. That said, there have been more recent claims that it’s simply an adaptation of a 1930s recipe for lemon pie created by a condensed milk manufacturer 1,500 miles north in New York City, but I won’t go there. Instead, here’s a recipe.Most key lime pie recipes make use of the aforementioned condensed milk, beaten with egg yolks to enrich it and turn it into a kind of quick custard. The mixture is further thickened by the addition of lime juice, whose acidity “cooks” the yolks, coagulating the proteins to give the whole thing a stiffer consistency. The more yolks you use, the richer and firmer the result – chef Brad McDonald’s pie, from his book Deep South, is undoubtedly delicious with just two, but it’s tricky to cut into neat slices. Four is more usual, and safer. (Interestingly, I have some trouble getting hold of condensed milk the man behind the counter in the third shop I try tells me demand has soared this summer. If anyone can explain why, please do let me know in the comments below my theory is no-churn ice cream.)Many American recipes express caution on the subject of raw egg yolk that’s less of a concern in the UK, where hens are vaccinated against salmonella, but that’s no reason not to try a baked recipe when Cooks Illustrated magazine makes such a compelling case for heat yielding a “thick, creamy and unctuous” (though I suspect they mean rich) filling with a pronounced lime flavour – “the difference was remarkable”. My panel, however, feels that it also gives the pie a texture more reminiscent of a baked cheesecake, particularly if, like Pepe’s Cafe in Key West (“the oldest eating house in the Keys!”), you whisk egg whites into the mixture to make it really fluffy. Better, if you’re really keen to serve up perfect wedges, to go down the freezer route, as Jennifer Steinhauer’s recipe for the New York Times suggests. Not only is this the dish that Meryl Streep pushes into Jack Nicholson’s smug face in the film adaptation of Nora Ephron’s Heartburn, but the icy temperature brings out the custardy smoothness of the filling in a way that’s extremely satisfying to eat. I haven’t suggested this step in the recipe below, because it’s not always practical, especially if you want to take the pie to a picnic, but I would recommend giving it a whirl if you are serving it in the vicinity of a freezer: leave it in there for at least three hours, then get it out 10 minutes before serving.Two of the recipes I try take a rather different approach. The Chez Panisse lemon meringue pie, which the New York Times cookbook suggests can be easily adapted to make a key lime variation, is made with a citrus curd that utilises eggs yolks and butter, thickened over heat, to make a very rich filling (“Are you sure this isn’t a lemon meringue pie?” someone queries in the gathering dusk of our socially distanced outdoor taste test), while photographer Stephen Shore’s key lime pie supreme has a cornflour and water base, with just a little butter. Mild and gently wobbly, it’s my favourite, because I must confess I find ordinary key lime pie rather intense – so sweet! So rich! So tangy! – but this is a democracy, and the panel vote for the traditional version.Some recipes assert that this pie is only worth making with key limes, the local name for a distinct species of thin-skinned, acidic, south-east Asian lime thought to have been brought to the Keys by Spanish sailors, and rhapsodise over their gorgeously aromatic qualities. In blind taste tests, however, this claim doesn’t always stand up, but whether or not they have a point, the fact remains that even on the Keys themselves, the limes used tend to be grown in Mexico, and even these are very rarely found outside the Americas, so I’ll be using standard fruit here. A good way to create a more well-rounded, perfumed flavour is to add zest, as most recipes suggest, whisking it with the yolks to release the volatile oils before stirring in the condensed milk and juice. Half a cup, or 120ml, juice is fairly standard – when you learn this is about four standard or 20 key limes, you may well feel relieved they’re so hard to come by.Though most older recipes for key lime pie use a graham cracker crust (graham crackers being a popular American biscuit) of the type popularised by Nabisco to promote its wares in the Great Depression, some more recent ones recommend pastry – Chez Panisse’s version uses a flaky version that, while delicious, is far too delicate for this unapologetically unsubtle dessert (I’d also question whether it’s enough for the size of tin called for in the recipe, but that’s an argument for the New York Times). The chunkier, rougher, more robust texture of a biscuit crust works much better.McDonald makes his own crackers first, adding honey and cinnamon to the dough, too – excellent on their own but, once whizzed to fine crumbs and then mixed with melted butter, my panel, after hacking at my pie tins, pronounce the fruits of my labour “too solid, like a rock”, voting instead for a crust made with shop-bought digestive biscuits. I’m rather taken with Bon Appetit’s suggestion of substituting the butter with coconut oil for a suitably tropical taste, but the panel aren’t convinced, so I’ll leave that one up to you, like the cinnamon I’m not so keen on. Do add a pinch of salt, though – it will be very welcome with the intensely sweet and sour filling.You could leave your key lime pie plain, as Pepe Cafe and McDonald do, but it looks more impressive with a topping meringue is one option, but though that’s a handy way to use up those excess egg whites, and my testers are vociferous in their support for it, when questioned, they admit that, much as they like meringue, it is “a lot” in combination (egg whites are great in daiquiris, by the way). Whipped cream, meanwhile, proves a soothing foil for the tangy filling and crunchy base – serve on the side, if you prefer (this makes it easier to transport), and garnish with slices of lime, if you’re playing to the camera.For the base 200g digestive biscuits (about 14)75g butter, or coconut oil, melted1 pinch saltFor the filling4 egg yolks4-5 limes400g tin condensed milkFor the topping (optional)300ml whipping or double cream1 tbsp icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C (150 fan)325Fgas 3 and grease a 20cm tart tin. Crush the biscuits to a fine crumb (this is easiest in a food processor, if you have one).Stir in the melted butter or oil and salt, tip into the tin and press down firmly into the base and around the sides.Bake for 15 minutes, until dry to the touch, then remove and leave to cool before making the filling.Finely grate the zest from all four limes into a large bowl, add the egg yolks, then squeeze the juice from the fruit into a jug until you have 120ml.Beat the yolks and zest for a couple of minutes, until the yolks thicken and turn a pale green, then stir in the condensed milk.Finally, beat in the lime juice and taste – it should be shockingly tangy and sweet, though you can add more juice if you like, bearing in mind that chilling will make the flavour more subtle.Pour the filling into the cooled biscuit shell and chill for at least three hours, until set. Just before serving, whisk the cream and sugar in a large bowl until the mix holds soft peaks, then dollop on top. Garnish with extra lime slices, if you have them.• Is key lime pie Florida’s best culinary export, and if not, what would you recommend instead? Which other recipes allow lime, rather than lemon, to take centre stage, and what else can you do with a tin of condensed milk?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff02d590a99ec550c9a855e442e3b1b2477a7dd2/0_215_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652e3ea770674453653c8e44d9e9fcf9","title":"stamp duty chancellor rishi sunak summer statement","story":"Rishi Sunak has announced a stamp duty holiday in his summer statement. How will this affect you?The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced there will be no stamp duty to pay on property purchases up to £500,000.Stamp duty land tax, its proper name, is a tax paid by someone who purchases a property or piece of land in England or Northern Ireland – Scotland and Wales have their own systems. The tax is paid when the sale is completed and is based on the sum paid.Prior to the financial statement, there were two different points at which stamp duty was payable, depending on whether you were a first-time buyer or a mover. For movers, stamp duty had to be paid on any property costing more than £125,000.For first-time buyers there was no stamp duty to pay unless a property cost more than £300,000. If your first home cost more than £500,000 you paid the same as a mover but if it cost less than that, you only paid tax on the bit of the price that fell between £300,000 and £500,000.The cut will make a difference for anyone buying a property over the old thresholds. For first-time buyers, it will generally be those in the south-east and London who stand to benefit, as elsewhere they would typically not be spending more than £300,000.At £250,000, a first-time buyer was already off the hook for stamp duty but a mover would pay £2,500. They will now pay nothing.An investor spending £250,000 on a property will save £2,500, while one spending £495,000 will save £14,750.The housing market was frozen during lockdown, with buyers and sellers told to stall purchases. Since estate agents reopened there are signs that people are looking again – property websites and mortgage lenders have all reported sharp jumps in interest from prospective buyers but the Treasury is obviously worried that the rebound will be fleeting.While some people are not moving because of immediate financial problems that will be solved by the cut, there will be many others who are staying put because they have lost their jobs, or are concerned about the outlook for the industry they work in. The cut may bring forward purchases but it may not stimulate many extra ones.Previous holidays have focused on first-time buyers and do not seem to have led to a surge in sales. Analysis by the property firm Savills found that during two stamp duty holidays after the banking crisis – one between September 2008 and December 2009 and the second from March 2010 to March 2012 – there were 20,000 more sales in total. Over the past five years there have been typically about 1m sales in England annually.The chancellor mentioned that prices had fallen since the crisis and talked about taking away uncertainty for people, so the move seems designed to support values. Fuelling demand without adding to supply should mean prices do not crash. Some of the money saved by buyers could go towards their offer for a property and lead to increases in parts of the country where the market is busy. The fact that landlords and investors will also get a tax cut will make this more likely than if it had only applied to homebuyers.Typically, the largest increases come in the run-up to a stamp duty holiday ending, when people are keen to take advantage of the tax break while it lasts, so we could see a bubble next spring.For someone buying a property for £275,000 that is not their first home, the bill would be £3,750. A £475,000 property would usually attract stamp duty of £13,750, or £8,750 for a first-time buyer. On all purchases there is a surcharge if it is a second home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bb3888fe32302b7cbb925f41dfbd86caaf86f6a/0_474_4897_2935/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b58f0b3c8f93f1d8430629c34eb2d35","title":"brahms where to start with his music","story":"Our new series continues with Brahms - for some a reactionary, for others a radical, the highly wrought dramas of his symphonies and concertos and the quiet distinction of his chamber works have ensured his music enduresThis series began last week with Beethoven. Among the composers who took up the daunting challenge of the symphonic form, none was more aware of the legacy than Johannes Brahms (1833-97). The responsibility weighed heavily upon him, and it took him many years to emerge entirely from Beethoven’s shadow.Brahms’s works rarely feature among lists of the most well known classical tunes. But then his music never aims at instant effects he never bothered with the distraction of opera, and he generally avoided religious music. (His German Requiem, composed following the death of his mother, uses biblical texts, but it is not a liturgical work in any real sense.) Apart from his songs – more than 200 of them – almost everything that Brahms wrote was “absolute music”, ie music that is not explicitly “about” something.Nevertheless he composed some of the most frequently performed works in the concert repertoire. His Variations on a Theme of Haydn, often known as the St Anthony Variations, is a concert perennial and his Hungarian Dances are popular orchestral encore pieces, while the Academic Festival Overture quotes the student song Gaudeamus Igitur, still sometimes heard at graduation ceremonies. Perhaps the nearest Brahms came to a sentimental favourite was his Wiegenlied, Cradle Song, the lullaby he dedicated to a friend on the birth of her son. And Brahms’s two great piano concertos, both works of symphonic length and ambition, are perhaps the most archetypal of all romantic concertos, pitting a “heroic” solo piano against the might of a full orchestra.Brahms grew up in Hamburg. His father was an orchestral double bass player, who gave him his first music lessons. An early piano teacher complained that the young Brahms could be an even better pianist if he did not spend so much of his time composing. By the time he was 12, though, he was receiving composition lessons from pianist and composer Eduard Marxsen, who had not only known Beethoven and Schubert, but also hugely admired Haydn and Mozart, and ensured that his pupil was familiar with the tradition that those composers defined. Brahms made his debut as a pianist at the age of 14, and very soon began including his own works and arrangements in his recitals. However the story that in his teens he supplemented the family income by playing the piano in Hamburg brothels seems to be a myth.Violinist Joseph Joachim, who he met as a young man, became a lifelong friend. Both his Violin Concerto and the Double Concerto for violin and cello as well as three violin sonatas would be written for Joachim, and the violinist also led the first performances of a number of Brahms’s chamber works.It was thanks to Joachim that the 20-year-old Brahms met Robert and Clara Schumann. He was warmly welcomed and his talent immediately recognised. He had already published some pieces and arrangements under a pseudonym, but Schumann’s enthusiasm for his music enabled Brahms to get music published under his own name, including the three piano sonatas, and some songs. Schumann’s mental health was steadily worsening, though, and after attempting suicide in February 1854 he was confined to an asylum. His wife was not allowed to visit him, and Brahms became their intermediary. His Variations on a Theme of Schumann (1854) are dedicated to Clara, and in an attempt to distract her from her husband’s predicament, he also composed the Four Ballades Op 10, whose bardic intensity makes them unlike any other piano works of his.The nature of the friendship between Brahms and Clara Schumann has been the subject of much speculation. If it was an entirely platonic relationship it was certainly a very close one, which persisted until Clara’s death in 1896. She never remarried after Robert died in 1856, and nor did Brahms ever marry.The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in 1859, in which Brahms himself was the soloist, had been a failure, but through the 1860s he became increasingly successful, with works such as the Handel Variations for piano, String Sextet No 1, the Piano Quintet and the Horn Trio, and A German Requiem, as well as the music for domestic, drawing-room performance – songs and part-songs, and the popular Liebeslieder-Walzer.In 1860 Brahms had made an ill-judged intervention in a public debate on the future of German music, joining forces with Joachim and others to attack the New German School of composers, who regarded Liszt and Wagner (the latter by then the dominant figure in the arts in the German-speaking world) as their standard bearers. Brahms and his allies were dismissed as hopelessly reactionary and he never made public pronouncements again. After he settled in Vienna in 1863, though, his circle of friends included figures on both sides of this musical ide.Though Vienna, which became the capital of the newly formed Austro-Hungarian empire in 1867, was an increasingly prosperous city, it was culturally a relatively uneventful place at that time. The heady days of romanticism were past, while the next great artistic upheaval in the city was yet to come. Sigmund Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, which would be so influential on its composers, writers and painters in the early years of modernism, was written just after Brahms died. The Viennese waltz, though, was in its heyday, and among Brahms’s close friends in the 1880s and 90s was Johann Strauss II. In 1889, when Brahms was visited by one of Thomas Edison’s representatives to make a phonograph recording, one of the pieces he played was a polka by Josef Strauss, brother of Johann, and one of his last public appearances, in 1897, was to attend the premiere of one of Johann’s operettas.The First Symphony, which Brahms began working on in 1854, was finally premiered in 1876. It was a great success and over the next decade Brahms produced a flood of major works that included some of his most enduring masterpieces, works that epitomised his genius for finding new expressive paths through familiar musical forms. Apart from the Violin Concerto and the Second Piano Concerto there were three more symphonies, each strikingly different. Where the First Symphony sometimes struggles to escape from the past (Wagner even nicknamed it “Beethoven’s 10th”), the remaining three occupy worlds of their own – radiant, relaxed, almost bucolic, in the case of the Second tauter, more anguished but finally quietly optimistic in the F major Third and unmistakably tragic in the Fourth, with its tightly constructed finale in the form of a passacaglia (a series of variations over a repeated bass line) that resists any temptation to manufacture an optimistic major-key ending.Brahms’s musical innovations may have been less obvious and less revolutionary than those of his contemporary Wagner, and he has not been universally admired – Britten reputedly used to play through his music each year to remind himself how bad it was. But Brahms’s influence persisted well into the 20th century in the music of composers ranging from Elgar, who admired his ability to package potently expressive themes in rigorously constructed musical forms, to Schoenberg, who in the 1930s wrote an essay entitled “Brahms the Progressive” in which he maintained that Brahms’s use of classical forms as the foundation for his innovations in melody and harmony had formed the basis of his own radicalism.Brahms’s final orchestral work was the Double Concerto of 1887, a peace offering to Joachim – they had fallen out when Brahms sided with Joachim’s wife over the couple’s orce. After the successful premiere of his Second String Quintet in 1890, he announced his retirement, but the playing of the clarinettist Richard Mühlfeld persuaded him to change his mind: the Trio for clarinet, cello and piano and two Clarinet Sonatas, and the Clarinet Quintet were all composed for Mühlfeld. Those quietly understated pieces, together with the four late collections of piano miniatures Opp 116 to 119, and the Four Serious Songs, composed after Clara Schumann’s death, seem far removed from the highly wrought dramas of the symphonies and concertos on which Brahms’s enduring reputation rests, but they inhabit a very distinctive musical world of their own.Almost all the great conductors of the last 100 years, from Wilhelm Furtwängler (Warner Classics) and Arturo Toscanini (RCA) to Claudio Abbado (Deutsche Grammophon) and Riccardo Chailly (Decca), have put their stamp on the Brahms symphonies. If you want to hear the works in less sumptuously upholstered versions, closer to the sound that Brahms himself might have expected, there are John Eliot Gardiner’s recordings (SDG). There’s an embarrassment of riches, too, among recordings of the piano concertos Emil Gilels’s performances from the 1980s (Deutsche Grammophon) and Nelson Freire’s (Decca) from 2005 stand out, while Julius Katchen’s survey of the solo piano music (Decca) and the Amadeus Quartet’s performances of the string quartets, quintets and sextets (Deutsche Grammophon) are wonderful bargain collections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51c254579e7a4b2e6deca489b82edb80236a2dc/412_149_2114_1269/master/2114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4498920be811fc1be4f4fdcb4dcff3db","title":"ja ja ding dong how schlager found its joyful place pop eurovision","story":"Will Ferrell’s new Eurovision movie dances to the bouncing beat of schlager, Germanic folk-pop reclaimed from the spectre of nationalism by embracing kitschAt the beginning of the new Netflix movie Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, aspiring musicians Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are workshopping material that will hopefully be good enough for Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic talent show for a Eurovision place. But performing at a local bar, their attempts at presenting something new are cut short by patrons who clamour for Ja Ja Ding Dong, which the pair half-heartedly agree to perform.

The eyerolling of Lars and Sigrit to their own song is appropriate for a style that’s deemed parochial, superficial and old-fashioned this very newspaper once dubbed it Germany’s most embarrassing musical genre and online publication the Awl asked in 2017: Is Schlager Music The Most Embarrassing Thing Germany Has Ever Produced? “Listening to schlager gives you some notion of what American pop music might sound like without the African influence – in a word, cheesy,” writes John Seabrook in The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory.But even though it’s become a punchline once again, I love schlager, and unironically so. I love the frequently occurring one-two rhythm – the oompah! – and the cheerful, sweet melodies and lyrics, which, while lacking wit and bite, are unbridled expressions of joy. I dare you to listen to the schlager renditions of Rosamunde, or Anton aus Tyrol praising his own virility, for example, without cracking a smile. I also love the way this bright, shiny thread is woven so closely into the fabric of pop music.The first piece of music that was labelled as schlager is the Johann Strauss waltz An der Schönen Blauen Donau (The Blue Danube) described in the Wiener Fremdenblatt newspaper in 1867 as “ein entschiedener schlager” (a clear hit). It also referred to operetta lieder, such as Johann Strauss’s drinking song Im Feuerstrom der Reben in Die Fledermaus and Das Macht die Berliner Luft Luft Luft in Paul Lincke’s Frau Luna: these ensemble numbers use repetition, rhyme, and an upbeat rhythm to conjure what we would now call an earworm.Schlager was also popular in Weimar Germany, and it actively celebrated the frivolous joys of life, including desire and infatuation, with a generous use of double entendre. The harmony ensemble Comedian Harmonists, in their song Veronika, Der Lenz ist Da (Veronika, spring is here), mention asparagus, a clear phallic symbol, sprouting and growing in their Maskenball im Gänsestall (Masquerade in the goose coop), they address their love interest by saying: “It’s May, come lay an egg with me.”The Third Reich dampened salaciousness and frivolity, but schlager triumphantly returned after the second world war its innate cheer also became a celebration of the German economic miracle. This had another interesting consequence: in the mid-1950s, schlager started borrowing melodies and harmonies from the south of Europe, as a result of more Germans spending their holidays in the Mediterranean. Italian-born singers such as Caterina Valente and Rocco Granata contributed to this crossover.When Germany was inundated by English-language pop and rock, schlager inevitably took a backseat. Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix embodied the spirit of the new rebellion bigoted conservatives dismissed it as “negermusik” and fell back on schlager, beginning its unlucky association with parochialism and traditionalism.“It’s considered arch-conservative and bourgeois,” ethnomusicologist Julio Menil told Deutsche Welle, which labelled schlager as Grandma’s Music in 2011. “Schlager evoked consoling images of a beautiful and romantic countryside and painted a distorted, idyllic picture of Germany that excluded any reference to the horrors of the war and the atrocities of the concentration camps,” Menil wrote in German Pop Music: A Companion, taking issue with the “schlager dream”, and its pretence of Germany being a clean slate.But while a treacly, oldtime-y version of schlager still exists (Tausend Träume Immer Noch by Amigos is a great example), starting in the 1960s, schlager began incorporating elements of pop and dance, merging with mainstream disco: a good early example of this is Moskau by the band Dschinghis Khan.This approach, coupled with Italian and Spanish influences, yielded gems such as Arabesque’s Caballero, DJ Ötzi’s schlager-Eurodance hybrid Pronto Giuseppe, and Frau Kapitän by Calimeros, an ode to the Med. While they are by no means high art, their entertainment potential is undeniable, and the cross-pollination with – even appropriation of – southern European pop certainly enriched schlager’s sound. (As an Italian who spent most of her childhood and teenage years in German-speaking environments, I am not offended by this, but delighted.)Its versatility was even clearer in Sweden, whose own brand of schlager is more familiar thanks to their biggest music export, Abba. Their harmonies, countermelodies and synthetic sounds became the standard in pop music in the following decades, all of which are quite indebted to schlager. “Abba took the flowing melodic element in Swedish folk songs and hymns,” writes Seabrook, “and added elements of schlager music.” He says the group keep schlager “at arm’s length, but you can hear it in the wheezy organ sounds in Take a Chance on Me.” The kitschy exoticism of Fernando and Chiquitita, a marked oompah base for I Have a Dream, and outsized sentimentality for The Winner Takes It All – this is all quintessential schlager.Swedish schlager has a distinctive quality, wherein happy-sounding songs have an air of melancholy, and vice versa: this has been widely adopted in mainstream pop music as the hallmark of producer Max Martin. In an interview in the New Yorker from 2014, Tove Lo described Swedish pop as having “clear but simple lyrics, is a lot about the melody, and also having a little bit of melancholy or a darker sense to it, to not make it too sugary or too bubblegum.” Take the Swedish Eurodance hit Dolce Marmellata by Domenicer, whose upbeat tempo is counterbalanced by a somewhat sombre vocal track, or Danish pop group Aqua’s 1997 hit Barbie Girl, a schlager-infused number whose minor key adds an uncanny element to the otherwise upbeat melody, and has made the tune age particularly well.Schlager gets a further boost by our willingness to embrace camp, and over-the-top “so bad they’re good” cultural products. Films such as The Room and Showgirls have gone through a cultural redemption, first by becoming cult-like sensations, then by getting movies made about them, namely the feature film The Disaster Artist and the documentary You Don’t Nomi. Pre-Raphaelite painters were mostly dismissed as kitsch until they were reassessed in the 1960s, and now major museums host retrospectives. Holst’s Planets suite was frowned upon by refined cultural elites, but became a foundational work for movie soundtrack composers (Hans Zimmer and John Williams above all). Celine Dion, once a dismissed as a treacly chanteuse has been embraced as a quirky fashion and music icon.Schlager has a substantial camp component: the juxtaposition of sweeping music and mundane lyrics treads the line between farce and seriousness. Nicole’s Ein Bisschen Frieden is a perfect example, said by Schlager scholar André Port le Roi to have won Eurovision 1982 for a “very typical German mixture of emotionality with a hysterical apocalyptic mood”. Leaning into that camp potential, schlager managed to partially reinvent itself in the 2000s, to the point that, each year, Hamburg hosts the Schlagermove music parade, a gathering of 500,000 (only 50,000 attended when it started in 1997). Conchita Wurst’s Eurovision-winning drag performance of Rise Like a Phoenix is a perfect example of schlager and camp Evighet by Carola (2006) and Take Me To Your Heaven (1999) and Hero (2008) by Charlotte Perrelli show how schlager continues to work well with Europop. By folding schlager into wider pop forms, these artists have made it less conservative and nationalistic, and by casting those nationalistic elements as camp and silly, they detoxify them too.In the last decade, singer Helene Fischer, known as the “queen of schlager” has sold more than 13m records. Her most famous hit Atemlos durch die Nacht combines Schlager’s signature sentimentality with a grittier sound, and, language notwithstanding, it has all the elements to be a global pop anthem in the same vein as Lady Gaga’s Rain on Me, whose own Europop influences are blatant. What schlager is perhaps now losing in kitsch, it is acquiring in wider palatability.“If you really want to know what makes a song powerful, I would say look at how the memory works,” said physiologist Harry Witchel when analysing the structural perfection of Abba’s Waterloo in 2005 for the BBC. “Memory works either through strong emotions or through repetition – that’s how we normally teach. And Abba songs allow for both of those things to occur.”This also applies to all aforementioned schlager hits: their melodies, coupled with their repetitive and alliterative lyrics create a pleasant cycle of repetition and emotions rooted in escapism. The meaninglessness of the lyrics, the ahistorical dream-Europe the songs evoke, and the forgiving framework of camp mean that schlager can now mean almost anything to anyone. Just as Strauss’s Die Fledermaus transports the viewer into an amusing comedy of errors, or the Blue Danube to that very river, so schlager hits give us the illusion of an idyllic reality, where all that matters is love, sun and vacation – somewhere you can finally feel a ding-ding dong, whatever you want that to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2e3bcf27c738c1a9f5621920d46cadf518962d1/0_154_2848_1708/master/2848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=323b6530364202f602910467e8ef79e7","title":"taking on sir humphrey can the civil service be reformed podcast","story":"Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service. But as former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell argues, it is easier said than doneWhen Jonathan Powell arrived in Downing Street in 1997 as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, he was met with a handshake from the head of the civil service. From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality.  Powell tells Anushka Asthana that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate. For Jonathan Powell, the acid test will be whether Gove can deliver on these words, which have echoes back to the 1960s and Harold Wilson’s government’s promises."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa3da11ba180745d661ebb324983c977082cc6b5/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e40613613d6d9ff53a61a224f600d038","title":"rishi sunak prepares for mini budget with help of 180 smart mug","story":"Pictures show chancellor with cup that ‘does more than simply keep your coffee hot’For George Osborne it was a Byron burger and chips, with the upmarket chain undermining his bid to convey a man-of-the-people image. Philip Hammond settled for a personalised Emma Bridgewater mug emblazoned with his name.But the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appears to have gone one step further in the traditional pre-budget photo opportunity by posing with a “smart mug” costing £180.A series of snaps released by the Treasury show Sunak at work, with the expensive gadget on his desk as he pores over the details of the mini-budget he will deliver to the Commons on Wednesday.The Ember travel mug, reportedly a gift from his wife, Akshata Murthy, the daughter of a billionaire businessman, retails for up to £179.95 online, with a product description boasting that it “does more than simply keep your coffee hot”.It adds: “Our smart mug allows you to set an exact drinking temperature and keeps it there for up to three hours, so your coffee is never too hot, or too cold.” The 355ml mug is apparently dishwasher safe and even includes a charging coaster.It is a far cry from the image of Osborne chomping on fast food that he tweeted in 2013 on the night before he delivered the comprehensive spending review. The picture prompted ridicule, with the then chancellor accused of a misguided attempt to project a populist image. The Sun pointed out that the cheapest Byron burger was priced at £6.75, with the lowest priced McDonald’s at 99p.Osborne saw the funny side and later tweeted: “There I am working late on my speech, and I’ve got a takeaway hamburger, but it puts you on the front page of the Sun.

Cummings has visited MI5 and MI6, the domestic and foreign intelligence agencies, twice already, it said.The idea is to showcase some of the MoD’s flagship operations to an adviser who has complained that military procurement “has continued to squander billions of pounds” and who has written in his personal blog of the potential for drone warfare.The tour was deemed sufficiently important by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that he and his special adviser wanted to arrange its outline themselves before handing over to officials, according to the email.It is understood Cummings’ clearance level was checked to ensure he was permitted to visit the national security sites on the list and to engage in open conversations with troops, researchers and intelligence specialists present.Downing Street has restarted an integrated review of defence and foreign policy, which was delayed by the coronavirus crisis. It aims to look at the strategic objectives for the armed and security forces for the next five years and is intended to feed into the autumn spending round.Over the weekend there was speculation that the armed forces faced significant cuts, including reducing the size of the army by nearly 20,000, to 55,000 personnel, but this was repeatedly denied by Wallace, who said the review process had hardly begun.On Tuesday, the Conservative backbencher Mark Francois warned the head of the armed forces that Cummings would “sort you out”, after a lengthy complaint about the MoD’s procurement processes.Speaking at the defence select committee, the influential Brexiter told Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff: “Can we just make a plea to you. You are the professional head of the armed forces. Please nip back to the department and ask them to sort their bloody selves out, because if not, Cummings is going to come down there and sort you out his own way, and you won’t like it.”Cummings’ status within government appears to have rapidly recovered after he endured intense criticism for travelling to and around County Durham with his family during lockdown.His enthusiasm for the potential for military technology is well known. In March 2019, before he entered government, Cummings wrote: “A teenager will be able to deploy a drone from their smartphone to sink one of these multibillion-dollar platforms. Such a teenager could already take out the stage of a Downing Street photo op with a little imagination and initiative, as I wrote about years ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4191ae7083717f58208cfcf20a8a3b1493cc1c9e/1109_947_3213_1928/master/3213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5544ef013231a78a7c822f5377e346c5","title":"my online business flourished the ethical brand that boomed when the high street shut down","story":"Kaela Mills had to shut her Bexhill childrenswear shop because of the coronavirus crisis, but she soon found success thanks to her savvy decision to expand her websiteWhen the government announced its lockdown measures for the UK, Kaela Mills felt decidedly gloomy about the future of her ethical childrenswear brand, Sprout. “When everything first started, I genuinely didn’t think my business was going to make it through,” she says. “Not knowing how long the lockdown was going to last was incredibly anxiety-inducing. I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Alonso, who turns 39 this month, has been out of the sport since he appeared to bring down the curtain on his career with McLaren 18 months ago.But the Spaniard, who won successive championships with Renault in 2005 and 2006, has now completed a sensational comeback with the French manufacturer. Alonso replaces Daniel Ricciardo, who is moving to McLaren at the end of the year. The Australian is taking over from Carlos Sainz before his switch to Ferrari.Alonso told Renault’s website: “Renault is my family, my fondest memories in Formula One with my two world championship titles, but I’m now looking ahead. It’s a great source of pride and with an immense emotion I’m returning to the team that gave me my chance at the start of my career and which now gives me the opportunity to return to the highest level.“I have principles and ambitions in line with the team’s project. Their progress this winter gives credibility to the objectives for the 2022 season and I will share all my racing experience with everyone from the engineers to the mechanics and my team-mates. The team wants and has the means to get back on the podium, as do I.”Alonso has competed in 311 grands prix, winning 32 of them. He starred for Renault in the early years, before quitting McLaren after one season following a turbulent campaign alongside the then-rookie Lewis Hamilton.He returned to Renault before a four-year period at Ferrari where he came close to winning the title on two occasions. After falling out with the Italian team, he went back to McLaren, but the switch proved desperately unsuccessful.Alonso quit the sport after four seasons with McLaren, setting his sights on becoming only the second driver since Britain’s Graham Hill to complete the Triple Crown of the Monaco Grand Prix, Le Mans 24 Hours and Indy 500.Although he won the famous sportscar endurance race in 2018 and 2019 he has not been able to crack the Indy 500, despite a remarkable effort on his first appearance in 2017.Renault are struggling in the sport, but Alonso will be hoping that an overhaul in the regulations and the introduction of a £115m-a-season budget cap in 2022 will fire them back up the grid. He will partner the Frenchman Esteban Ocon.Cyril Abiteboul, the managing director of Renault Sport Racing, said: “The signing of Fernando Alonso is part of Groupe Renault’s plan to continue its commitment to F1 and to return to the top of the field. The strength of the bond between him, the team and the fans make him a natural choice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bf60ab905f63bf6dec2aa60a4079bf4d7b01d41/0_112_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3be3cafca9b19a96dfc3c79d5d61d31b","title":"plan to hold masters in november shows augusta national is out of touch","story":"With Covid-19 cases surging in Georgia, 16 weeks does not feel long enough for things to change sufficientlyAugusta National is one venue where silence can never be mistaken for inaction. As the United States remains in the grip of Covid-19 – and its sporting calendar impacted accordingly – it would be an error to suppose those who preside over the Masters blithely believe their event is unaffected.In his last bulletin, in early April, Augusta National’s chairman, Fred Ridley, sought to “emphasise that our future plans are incumbent upon favourable counsel and direction from health officials”. This will be the most intense of watching briefs.As things stand, the 2020 Masters remains in its rescheduled start date of 12 November. So far as soundings are valid in relation to an organisation which makes the Secret Service look like blabbermouths, Augusta National still expects that date to stand.Up for detailed discussion, apparently, is whether or not spectators should be allowed inside one of sport’s most fabled venues. Imagine winning sport’s equivalent of Willy Wonka’s golden ticket before discovering you weren’t allowed on the premises?Strange as it may seem, the Masters has become the forgotten element of this professional golf year. Close attention has turned towards the US PGA Championship, which will belatedly kick off the majors year in early August.That the US Open is subsequently to be held on the outskirts of New York, a city all-too familiar with the impact of coronavirus, has kept that tournament in the spotlight. A raging debate has surrounded the holding or otherwise of the Ryder Cup. The Masters, having acted swiftly in proposing its November date, has widely been assumed to be a competition which will take place at the other side of global crisis.It is fair to acknowledge a $2m donation made by Augusta National towards coronavirus relief. It must also be recognised that the vast corporate  of the club’s membership – and therefore decision makers – means there should be no danger of out-of-touch behaviour. In theory, that is you need step only a matter of yards inside Augusta National to appreciate how seriously they take their golf tournament.Ultimately, despite inevitable noises about force for good and affording the watching world some respite, that’s all it is. When Billy Payne, Ridley’s predecessor, mourned the loss of a tree that blew down in a 2014 storm it was clear perspective may not always be in plentiful supply at Augusta. “At the time it happened, I was in the Bahamas bone fishing,” was Payne’s famous recollection. “I received the emergency call, got back as fast as I could.” To emphasise: this was a tree.It added: “We are seeing a very troubling increase in hospitalisations that, if continuing, will overwhelm our healthcare infrastructure, not only in Atlanta but also in rural Georgia. Georgia is simply not prepared for a surge in cases and hospitalisations.” So, like so much of the US, this situation is not improving.It may yet prove the case that November offers sufficient scope for things to ease. Yet right now, it feels as if little can be altered within 16 weeks. And Augusta, naturally, cannot make last-minute decisions. The vast, green expanses would make interesting television viewing without patrons but a Masters minus those who line fairways would be worse off on umpteen levels.In the most complex of circumstances, we also have the prospect of two Masters within six months as Augusta leaps from the amended 2020 version to its typical staging in early 2021. Even for a body which revels in making the impossible seem normal, this feels like a stretch. Yes, Augusta could invest in the most advanced technology that checks the temperature – or pulse, or aftershave – of spectators upon entry, but this resource might really be better deployed elsewhere.Next weekend, the world’s best golfers should have been lining up at Royal St George’s for the Open. Given the ongoing scale of coronavirus, the R\u0026ampA unquestionably made the right call in postponing for 12 months. In the absolute best-case scenario, the Claret Jug would have been awarded to the winner of a vastly diminished event, even before needless pressure on public services is contemplated.Golfers will be desperate to compete in the Masters, be it their first or 25th . A rump of opinion in the US – inside and outside of this sport – suggests we must live with Covid-19 while continuing to act as normally as possible. To others, this approach is offensive. On a basic sporting level, it must be asked at which point a blue chip event is modified sufficiently to lose value.“Along the way, we hope the anticipation of staging the Masters tournament in the fall brings a moment of joy to the Augusta community and all those who love the sport,” added Ridley. That may well be true. However, this is also a scene fraught with difficulty. Absence from the front line hasn’t changed that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba8d869f6ed1a773e1a40e8227d2c3416b34193a/0_21_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68916d66aa31fd1cfbf938168347a165","title":"honk if youre laughing drive in gigs aim to accelerate comedy industry","story":"While they wait for clubs to reopen, standups are returning to the stage in car parks, with audiences tuning in on the radioIn his new Netflix special, US standup Dave Chappelle reflected on the drive-in comedy shows that have sprung up while clubs are closed during the pandemic. Audiences watching from cars and honking their horns if they liked a joke, didn’t “sound like any fun at all” to Chappelle. However, until the UK’s comedians are allowed to perform in venues again, drive-in outdoor gigs offer a way forward for an industry devastated by Covid-19.Last weekend, the first such shows in the UK took place in a car park by Brent Cross shopping centre, just off the M1 in north-west London. Comic Kai Humphries, who appeared at The Drive-In Club, said it was good to be back at the mic again but that after such a long break from live performance he would have preferred a “little basement with 30 people”. However, he described performing before rows of vehicles as feeling like “200-odd intimate gigs” because rather than hearing his voice booming out across the car park, audiences tuned in on their radios while watching him on a giant LED screen.Most comedians like to play in intimate clubs with a low ceiling “to keep the laughter in”, said Humphries, so considering the less than ideal circumstances of the drive-in set-up, it was “a miracle that it worked”. He performed at dusk amid wet and windy weather and said he could still make out some faces in the cars in the front row but that the nature of the show had obviously affected his crowdwork. He found himself ribbing vehicles instead of punters. “I took the piss out of a couple of cars – you know, ‘Flash your indicators if you’re in a BMW. Ah, so you do know where they are!’”Audiences purchased advance tickets that were priced according to the number of people in each car, and payments for food and drink were contactless. Parking was unreserved, with vans and motorbikes among the vehicles not permitted. Audiences were allowed to watch from outside their car, and use a portable radio if they preferred. The venue’s capacity is 400 cars per show, which means a sold-out event could have an audience of more than 2,000 people. At The Drive-In Club’s opening weekend, prankster Dom Joly had technical difficulties during his show, which he joked led to “the first car crash at a drive-in”. At the end of Holiday Snaps, a tongue-in-cheek lecture about his travels around the world, Joly reflected on an inauspicious start: “This is probably the future of entertainment – let’s hope it gets better.”Humphries said he wasn’t sure if the drive-in format would still work once clubs were back up and running but that it had been an “act of defiance” and a triumph against the odds. “People aren’t allowed to go to comedy but they’ve been given this way, with stipulations, that they can go – so everybody there had this buzz that we’ve figured out a way to see comedy.” The industry, he said, had shown innovation and resilience during lockdown in the face of little support from the government.Humphries did a 20-minute set opening for Daniel Sloss, and they later shared the stage to discuss life on the road as they do in their podcast. Lots of Humphries’ usual material, about airports and hotels, didn’t work in our “new normal”, he said, but he made plenty of jokes about lockdown life. Throughout lockdown, he has done Instagram comedy live streams twice a week, in which he knits while chatting to the audience. “I’ve had everything between 20 and 500 people at any one time,” he said. The streams are designed to offer company to those who live alone and might be finding isolation difficult, and Humphries added that they have been good for his own mental health, too. He believes the route back for comedians to appear in clubs might be securing permission to perform in outdoor venues such as beer gardens first.In the meantime, The Drive-In is presenting performances by standups including Nish Kumar, Shappi Khorsandi and doctor-turned-comic Adam Kay, as well as film screenings. A separate venue, The Drive-In at Troubadour Meridian Water in Edmonton, north London, is presenting a similar programme of films and live entertainment. Comics set to perform there include Fern Brady and Jamali Maddix.Comedians are desperate to get back on stage, said Humphries, and to hear the roar of laughter rather than car horns. He found that he had slipped into a familiar rhythm on stage, timing his gags around the honks signifying his audience’s laughter. “It was strange to adjust because the sound of a car horn usually has a negative connotation,” he laughed. “When I was driving back from the gig, another driver honked their horn at someone and I got a feeling of warmth from it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d738c935bdb2ac3a6cef1dc2133080e1f93da99c/803_622_4813_2888/master/4813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257049a689dab7345eb767987ea7186f","title":"theatres that made us from manchesters royal exchange to cardiffs chapter","story":"Arts venues have been hit hard by the pandemic and are still unable to stage live performances. In the third part of a new series, we celebrate their essential roleShobna Gulati: My enduring love affair with theatre started when I fell head over heels with being “in the pod” of Manchester’s Royal Exchange in my early teens. I would be first in line on a Saturday morning with my best friend, queuing for a “banquette” for the matinee. Clutching our tickets, we would hang out in that colossal, echoey, airy, marble-pillared space we marvelled at all the magnificence as we ate our lunch. Typically, theatre loos are woeful, but the toilets were fabulous, with plenty of big cubicles and separate space to spruce up, so there was no rush when the hand bell rang for the start of the show.The seats we bought were very special – pocket-money-affordable and at stage level. You could hear every syllable, see every bead of sweat. It inspired me to become an actor. Very significant for me was seeing black and brown actors being brilliant and in leading roles in totally representative and integrated casts: Derek Griffiths in The Government Inspector, Art Malik in Great Expectations, Josette Bushell-Mingo as Cleopatra. I have seen extraordinary work there, sometimes with women cast in traditionally male roles, such as Maxine Peake’s Hamlet. Vivienne Franzmann’s play Mogadishu, which I saw in 2011, continues to fill my head with its story.My proudest moments as a performer happened in that building, too. First, as a teenage dancer, dancing the classical Bharatanatyam Alarippu one rainy Sunday afternoon. Little did I know I would end up acting in and choreographing some Royal Exchange productions myself. Working there requires the understanding that, wherever you are on that stage, you are in the palm of the audience’s hands.Tamara Harvey: 3am on a cold November night in 2003. Lighting designer Emma Chapman up a ladder, me on the lighting desk, working through the night to be ready for the dress rehearsal of Young Emma, an adaptation of WH Davies’ memoir by the unknown playwright Laura Wade. Suddenly, the electricity blew and we were plunged into darkness.In that moment, it felt like the theatre gods were mocking us, but I wonder now if they were just telling us to go home and get some sleep. Either way, that jewel of a fringe theatre – the Finborough in London – offered me and my now long-term collaborators a chance to make something together when we couldn’t get a foot in the door anywhere else. For that, I will love it always.And, like a Swiss army knife, Chapter is always there when you need it. It was created in 1971 (after a fundraising concert headlined by Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd) to give artists a place to work away from commercial pressures. These days, it’s a bit more black coffee than Black Sabbath, but the values remain and it has done so much for us: giving space, co-producing our work, even helping us create a safe audience conga with 150 people who had had copious Christmas drinks. It is outward-looking and welcoming, putting community connection at the heart of what it does. I can’t wait to get back in there for another German beer.Katie Arnstein: Redbridge Drama Centre in South Woodford is a remarkable place. It provides the community with a safe, supportive and generous environment in which to create, learn and be entertained. With theatres being closed, it is not the shows that I have missed, but the sense of togetherness that being in a theatre gives. And the venue I have missed the most is RDC.Its kind, passionate, warm and wise staff understand that theatre is for everyone. The venue is run by members of the community, for the community, and they invite everyone to be a part of it. To those who doubt the importance of theatre, particularly those in government, I invite you to ride your high horse to Redbridge Drama Centre. You will see that quality and entirely accessible theatre is not just important it is vital.Iqbal Khan: I was terrified meeting Kevin Shaw, the artistic director at the Oldham Coliseum. I was still in the middle of a bursary at the Leicester Haymarket and the play we were talking about me possibly directing was Beautiful Thing by Jonathan Harvey. I didn’t feel qualified, in any sense.Kevin refused to let me sit. He walked me around the beautiful, slightly ramshackle building, introducing me to every person who worked there. The place felt alive with the voices of the town – mothers who had seen shows there as children and now worked on the box office, young people who had returned to the town and worked in marketing, local builders in the workshop. They were all excited about encountering someone who bore so little resemblance to them, prospectively coming and creating something that would take them all somewhere new, keen to help me make whatever I might dream up.It was a magical, brave and profoundly compassionate experience. Kevin and the Oldham Coliseum made me feel valuable and visible. And I will always cherish the strength and joy they engendered in me. I got the job! My first. It was a beginning and I loved the theatre, learned from the people in that building and have always been thrilled by the honest, generous and passionate audiences.Mike Kenny: York Theatre Royal, in the town where I live, is an old and beautiful building, but much of the exciting work I have done with it has not actually been on either of its two stages. I think it started in a huge tent over a railway line at the back of the National Railway Museum, where we did The Railway Children with a classic steam train borrowed from the museum. We then revived the York Mysteries under the walls of St Mary’s Abbey, with 1,700 local people. A couple of years later, in Blood and Chocolate, a collaboration with Slung Low and Pilot Theatre, we were moving hundreds of people through the streets of the city telling the stories of the workers of the Rowntree’s factory during the first world war.It’s a beautiful building, but it’s porous. It’s the people, young and old, who pass in and out of it. York Theatre Royal is not just a building and what happens inside it it is the beating cultural heart of the city. I hope that recent events do not drive it back within its walls. I love it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef962938135ec1730498df89244fb36163e4ef08/26_162_5239_3143/master/5239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a090ebf2f824641c563e688b4af1cb","title":"uber to launch london commuter boat service with thames clippers","story":"US firm will buy naming rights for fleet and piers, and users can book journeys on its appUber is to extend its reach in London by taking to the water, with the Thames Clippers commuter service to be rebranded Uber Boat and bookable through the US company’s app.A formal partnership will be launched this summer, allowing Uber users to book a Thames river journey through the app, and board using a QR code on their phone. Uber will buy the naming rights for the 20-strong fleet of river boats and Thames Clipper’s piers from Putney to Woolwich, in a rolling contract expected to last for at least three years.A move into fix-scheduled commuter boats is a first for Uber. Users will still pay the same price and although there are hopes for an integrated service, for now they will not be able to book an end-to-end journey with a connecting car. Thames Clippers tickets will still be available to buy elsewhere and the boats remain part of the Oyster network.Sean Collins, Thames Clippers’ co-founder and chief executive, said: “In our 22nd year of operation it is key that we continue to support London and its commuters with the ease of lockdown and return to work. The new partnership will allow us to link the two travel modes of river and road, providing Londoners and visitors with even more options to commute, visit, explore and enjoy our city by river.”Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said: “Many Londoners are looking for new ways to travel around the city, particularly when they start commuting back to work.”The boat service resumed on 15 June after being closed when the coronavirus outbreak took hold. It has reduced capacity and passengers must wear face masks, in line with Transport for London (TfL) guidance. Last year 4.3m passengers used the Thames Clippers service, which remains majority-owned by AEG, the owner-operators of the O2 entertainment venue.TfL has yet to renew Uber’s licence to operate private hire cars in London. Uber’s application for a new licence was rejected in November because of safety fears after some drivers were found to have faked their identity. It has been allowed to continue operating pending an appeal – which was originally due to have been heard in a magistrate’s court this week. However, because of the impact of the pandemic on TfL’s resources, the hearing has been postponed until September.TfL said it granted licences to river operators such as Thames Clippers “who comply with our high safety standards” but played no role in any partnerships with other businesses and organisations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned. On the path to this goal, they’ve released their first hybrid SUV, the CR-V, which features Intelligent Multi-Mode Drive (i-MMD) technology, enabling it to shuffle seamlessly between power sources.

Despite the data showing a runaway growth in case figures in the US, Trump has reportedly sought to blame Mexico for the crisis and erroneously claimed Tijuana was “heavily infected with covid”.Trump welcomes his Mexican counterpart, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, at the White House on Wednesday in a meeting meant to celebrate the newly implemented USMCA, but will inevitably include talks on the pandemic.Like Trump, López Obrador has shrugged off advice on mask-wearing and downplayed the coronavirus, even as his country struggles to deal with the outbreak.And like the US, Mexico has not rolled out a widespread testing program, prompting widespread speculation that the scale of the pandemic has been dramatically underreported. Amlo took his first coronavirus test only this week, amid preparations for his US visit.But Mexican states near the border are increasingly coming to see US tourists and the constant cross-border traffic as a hindrance to containment efforts, and have asked the Mexican federal government to impose restrictions.“It’s so important to implement the necessary measures to protect the health of Sonorans. And one of them at this time has to be reducing the border crossings from the United States to Mexico,” Sonora’s health secretary, Enrique Clausen, said earlier this month.Over the Fourth of July weekend, Sonora set up checkpoints to screen people entering from the US, turning back tourists and others whose trips were deemed not be “essential travel”. An exception was made for the border crossing closest to Puerto Peñasco, which prompted residents along the route to block the road near the border, Arizona media reported.Other states have also set up health control stations. A “sanitary filter” in Mexicali caused delays of more than eight hours in 40C (104F) heat across the border in Calexico, California. Officials seized more than 2,000 cans of beer in the process, according to local media, as parts of Mexico have imposed dry laws during the pandemic.Landau previously urged Mexican officials to speed the opening of maquiladoras in the border region, saying continental supply chains could not be stopped indefinitely. The US government has also sent migrants back to Mexico, including people with Covid-19.The US-Mexico border is to remain closed to all but “essential trade and travel” until 21 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5421e241149520c16aeef8ff4fbbf0525686d3ab/0_31_5280_3169/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a23c0cf697001bd348781fadf5cd3803","title":"tati much loved french retailing institution shuts up shop in paris after 70 years","story":"Cut-price clothing chain falls victim to changing shopping habits and the Covid-19 lockdownby  Jon Henley in ParisFounded by a Tunisian immigrant at the end of the second world war in the mainly west African Barbès district at the foot of Montmartre, Tati grew into more than 100 outlets around France, and its pink-and-white chequered carrier bags became a style statement for film stars and celebrities.The company has been in difficulty for decades, having struggled to adapt its “pile ‘em high, sell ‘em cheap” strategy of the early postwar years to a more fashion-conscious clientele seduced by big fast-moving multinationals such as H\u0026ampM or Primark.The flagship Barbès store – the brand’s only outlet until 1978 – “never really saw its clients return” after the double blow of public transport strikes that brought Paris to a halt in December and January, followed by three months of Covid-19 lockdown, said the company’s managing director, Thierry Boukhari.Sales from October 2019 to May this year were two-thirds down on the same period 12 months earlier, he said, “and we find ourselves unfortunately obliged to close our historic shop and to find alternative employment for its 34 staff”.At the Barbès store on Wednesday, shoppers were nostalgic and upset. “Tati has always been a bit like the aunt who looks after you,” said Aminata Mbaye, 62, originally from Senegal. “Such a big choice. You could always find something you could afford, no matter how little money you had.”Fatoumata Diassouba, 71, from Ivory Coast, said the store had “always been the place you thought of first” for cheap clothes or fabrics. “It was always Tati, nowhere else. But it’s true, it’s not the same. I came this morning for T-shirts for the grandchildren. There’s not much.”For a multitude of Parisians of a certain generation, however, Tati – which started life as the first deep-discount, self-service fabrics shop in France – will always be the home of the £50 wedding dress, the £1 T-shirt (guaranteed to shrink in the first wash), and the 50p pair of pants.Once, customers would hide its carrier bags in shame, but over the years some of France’s most glamorous women have been more than happy to be seen sporting them in public, including the film star Brigitte Bardot, the novelist Françoise Sagan and even the wealthy socialite Nadine de Rothschild.The store was founded in 1948 by the late Jules Ouaki after he was demobbed from the Free French army. He wanted to name it after his grandmother, Tita, but since that was already registered as a brand name he had to settle for Tati. He had the simplest possible slogan: “Tati, les plus bas prix” (Tati, the lowest prices).By piling his goods up where everyone could see and touch them, clearly displaying their prices, and keeping things cheap by paying suppliers cash, he built the business into a huge success.In the 1990s Tati, by now run by Jules’ son Fabien, expanded abroad and attempted a move upmarket “from cheap to chic”, opening a branch on New York’s Fifth Avenue. It even made a short-lived foray into the world of fashion in 1991 with a critically acclaimed collection by Azzedine Alaia, modelled by Naomi Campbell for the fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth and, on the catwalk, by top models of the day including Helena Christensen, Yasmin Le Bon and Elle Macpherson.Yohann Petiot, of the Trade Alliance of French clothing and shoe retailers, said the store had fallen victim to changing shopping habits and the emergence of more aggressive rivals with the same bulk-purchase, high-volume business model.“But it has also been hit by the same crises that are causing problems across the whole retail sector: the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protests, the transport strikes, and finally the Covid-19 lockdown, which for some will be the final straw.”Tati left the Ouaki family’s hands in 2004 when its 100-plus loss-making stores were sold to the Eram group. In 2017, in even greater financial trouble, they were bought up by GPG, another retail group, which rebranded some and spun others off to their management.GPG said last year that the original Barbès store would be the only one to keep the Tati name, but has now conceded it is fighting a losing battle. Two small specialist shops, including Tati Mariage, which specialises in cheap wedding outfits, will continue trading for the time being."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e27b52eefa8c280978c7b9610fb257ac46b5d4c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=be856f455049d307bf37f0e5d6df175c","title":"who says evidence emerging of airborne coronavirus spread","story":"WHO bows to pressure from scientists about risk from aerosol transmission Brazil’s Bolsonaro tests positive Israel health chief resignsCoronavirus latest updatesUS still ‘knee-deep’ in pandemic says FauciBrazilian president Jair Bolsonaro tests positive for Covid-19The World Health Organization has acknowledged new evidence that the coronavirus spreads more widely in the air than it had previously suggested, as the Trump administration gave official notification of its withdrawal from the group.A day after a group of scientists said the global body was underplaying the risk of airborne transmission between people, a senior WHO official said there was “evidence emerging” of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, but that it was not definitive.Speaking at a media briefing in Geneva on Tuesday, Benedetta Allegranzi, the WHO’s technical lead for infection prevention and control, said: “...The possibility of airborne transmission in public settings – especially in very specific conditions, crowded, closed, poorly ventilated settings that have been described, cannot be ruled out.“However, the evidence needs to be gathered and interpreted, and we continue to support this.”The WHO has previously said the virus that causes the Covid-19 respiratory disease spreads primarily through small droplets expelled from the nose and mouth of an infected person that quickly sink to the ground.But in an open letter to the Geneva-based agency, published on Monday in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, 239 scientists in 32 countries outlined evidence that they say shows floating virus particles can infect people who breathe them in. Because those smaller exhaled particles can linger in the air, the scientists in the group had been urging WHO to update its guidance.“We wanted them to acknowledge the evidence,” said Jose Jimenez, a chemist at the University of Colorado who signed the paper.“This is definitely not an attack on the WHO. It’s a scientific debate, but we felt we needed to go public because they were refusing to hear the evidence after many conversations with them,” he told Reuters.Jimenez said historically, there has been a fierce opposition in the medical profession to the notion of aerosol transmission, and the bar for proof has been set very high. A key concern has been a fear of panic.“If people hear airborne, healthcare workers will refuse to go to the hospital,” he said. Or people will buy up all the highly protective N95 respirator masks, “and there will be none left for developing countries.”The WHO briefing came as the United States government gave formal notification of its intention to leave the organisation next year. Washington has accused the WHO of being too close to the government in Beijing and of not giving the world enough warning about the dangers of the coronavirus after it emerged in China in January.The move has almost no support from other countries and Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, said he would not follow through with the withdrawal if he is elected in November and said the US should instead push for reform of the WHO.Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate foreign relations subcommittee that oversees multilateral institutions, called the move “a huge win for China and a huge blow to the American people”.The US edged closer to recording 3 million cases of Covid-19 on another day of sharp rises across southern and south-western states. Both California and Texas reported more than 10,000 new cases on Tuesday.Some reports said the US had already passed the latest milestone in what is the largest outbreak in the world. But figures from Johns Hopkins University said there were just under 2,995,000 by Tuesday evening out of global total of 11.79m infections.More than 130,000 people have died in the US and Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s leading infectious diseases expert, said it was still “knee-deep” in the pandemic.The president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has tested psoitive for Covid-19. “There’s no reason for fear. That’s life,” said Bolsonaro, a rightwing populist who has consistently rubbished the risks from the disease even as it the country has racked up 1.6 million cases and seen 66,000 of its people die.In Australia there was chaos at the border between Victoria and New South Wales as roads linking the two states were closed for the first time in 100 years in an effort to suppress an outbreak of Covid in the former’s capital, Melbourne.Motorists endured long waits as they exited Victoria at the border town of Wodonga, with police checking every driver that they had a permit to leave.There were 127 new cases of Covid-19 in Victoria on Tuesday, the state premier said on Wednesday morning, down from 191 the day before.Israel’s public health chief has resigned in protest at the government’s handling of the crisis and a big rise in coronavirus cases.The country was praised for its strict initial lockdown in March but the reopening of schools, bars and restaurants has seen the outbreak worsen and many restrictions have been reimposed.Siegal Sadetzki announced her resignation with a lengthy critique of how the government had “lost its bearings”.An opposition MP in New Zealand will step down at September’s general election after it emerged that he leaked details of Covid-19 patients in an effort to expose what he claimed was the government’s mishandling of the crisis.And in Auckland, a man with Covid-19 who was being quarantined in a hotel managed to escape and make a dash to the supermarket for supplies. He has been charged with breaking new quarantine laws."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9bb3e0d9cb5622f2258a3660b23bae2bb107ef4/0_106_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fa0378e7ebbba4d991846347cf3f6ac","title":"indonesias yadnya kasada festival in pictures","story":"During the annual Yadnya Kasada festival, the Tenggerese people climb Mount Bromo, an active volcano, and seek the blessing of the gods by presenting offerings of rice, fruit, livestock and other items.

And here is the key chart in it, which tries to estimate the impact various government measures had on household incomes by May, compared to what would have happened if there had been no intervention.Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has welcomed the measures outlined in Rishi Sunak’s statement but said they belonged to “normal economic times” and that much more needed to be done to “build resilience in our poorest communities”.He said the chancellor should have increased the rate of statutory sick pay (SSP) from £95.85 per week and extended it to the 2 million workers for whom it is not currently available. The former Labour minister said people felt compelled to go into work despite being ill because they cannot afford to live on SSP.Social care staff should have been given an immediate pay risk and been able to isolate on full pay, Burnham said, adding that there was no support for directors of limited companies who had been “forgotten” by the Treasury.On coronavirus, Burnham said he had written to the health secretary Matt Hancock today to raise “specific concerns” from the region’s public health directors about the lack of data being provided by the government. He said the lack of complete and timely data from the government on patients affected, their ethnicity, and test and trace results was hampering the local response to any outbreaks.The government has said it cannot provide data on specific patients due to confidentiality rules. However, Burnham said the deadlock was preventing health officials from launching speedy investigations and that providing patient data was normal practice for any notifiable disease, adding:“Patient confidentiality ... does not trump public health and protecting lives in the middle of a pandemic.”NHS England has announced there have been a further 42 coronavirus hospital deaths in England. The full details are here.This is the highest daily figure for a week. For comparison, here are the equivalent daily figures for the past fortnight.The CEBR thinktank estimates that the stamp duty holiday will create 41,000 extra homes sales, by trimming £4,400 off the average cost of moving house.It could also drag another 60,000 sales forward as people try to take advantage before it runs out next March. Kay Daniel Neufeld, head of macroeconomics at CEBR, says the property market could struggle in 2021:We do expect, however, further weakness ahead as the slowdown in the economy, the end of the mortgage payment holiday and the rise in unemployment will exert downward pressure on prices. Here’s the announcement, if you missed it earlier:The stamp duty cut only applies in England and Northern Ireland, on the first £500,000 – but the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland could choose to introduce it too.The stamp duty holiday announced today has caused quite a stir in the property sector, with some industry figures warning it will distort the market in England and Northern Ireland.David Westgate, CEO at consultancy Andrews Property Group, says it’s a “high-risk” move that could drive prices sharply higher in the short-term.Making the much anticipated stamp duty cut temporary is a gamble if the economy hasn’t recovered by the spring.It is possible that we will have a boom scenario between now and April next year when a disproportionate number of people are buying at higher prices followed by softer prices when the scheme ends and asking prices are adjusted. Arguably the real winners will be purchasers of higher value properties who have just had £15k knocked off their completion bill, not the people it was intended for.Cliff-edge deadlines completely distort the market and rarely benefit the consumer.Yorkshire Building Society’s strategic economist, Nitesh Patel, argues stamp duty should be reformed. Sunak’s temporarily cut will mainly help the south of England, he warns:I would expect more homes to come on to the market as the stamp duty cut will improve the saleability of a home.Chris Denning, partner at MHA MacIntyre Hudson, reckons the holiday is too short to provide long-term help:The time period of the stamp duty relief announced by the chancellor, from now until 31 March 2021, is relatively short. It gives little opportunity for house builders to use the reduction to inform strategic decisions on construction plans beyond the next nine months.The current fall in house prices may also encourage people to sit tight until the market recovers and there is huge uncertainty around job security. This policy will likely need extending in order to have real economic impact.The Treasury is still working on a separate plan to help the long-term unemployed, according to a line in the Plan for Jobs document (pdf). This is from Robert Colvile from the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank.Business groups like the chancellor’s announcement.Here is an extract from the response from Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general.Today’s jobs plan is an important step forward. For young people, the kickstarter scheme will help create jobs in the short-run that can turn into opportunities for the long-run, and firms look forward to working with government to get it up and running quickly and well. It is also good to see direct support for apprenticeships and careers advice, which will help build the skills as well as the jobs of the future.And this is from Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at City firm IG, predicts that Rishi Sunak will need to produce more stimulus measures in the autumn budget. Today’s announcement won’t be enough to protect the economy...Pubs and housebuilders have been boosted by the news of additional programmes to boost consumer spending on meals out, a cut in VAT for tourism and hospitality and a stamp duty holiday.But for an economy so reliant on consumer spending, these are just trifles, of little use if consumers remain worried about the longer-term outlook for jobs and spending.Mr Sunak gets 5 out of 5 for effort today, but he will need to repeat the performance later this year and again in early 2021, since as he himself admits, we have only just begun the journey to recovery. Labour’s call for the furlough scheme to be extended beyond October has been backed by an unexpected ally - City firm JP Morgan.Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, argues that the chancellor is “giving with one hand, while taking away with the other”.He fears the new £1,000 jobs retention bonus, temporary VAT cut, stamp duty holiday and jobcentre support won’t make up for the removal of the support for furloughed staff, writing:On the one hand, the economy will be better off as a result of today’s announcements. That said, they’re unlikely to be enough to offset the coming hit to the economy from the scheduled winding down of the furlough scheme, potentially before activity has returned to pre-pandemic levels.Removing the furlough scheme before activity has recovered is like building three-quarters of a bridge and not finishing it because it is becoming expensive. Prematurely winding down the scheme risks having merely delayed job losses for millions of people, particularly in the worst-affected sectors such as hospitality and retail.Angela Merkel has said the European Union should prepare for talks with the UK to end in no deal.Speaking in the European parliament in Brussels, the German chancellor said progress in talks had been “slim, to put it diplomatically”. She explained:We agreed with the United Kingdom to accelerate the pace of talks to reach an agreement by autumn, an agreement that can be ratified by the end of the year. I will continue to push for a good solution but we should also prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.Germany took over the rotating presidency of the EU council on 1 July and is likely to play an increasingly important role behind the scenes as talks enter a crucial stage in the autumn.Merkel did not refer to Boris Johnson’s own preferred July deadline, widely seen as unrealistic by the EU side.Damian McBride, a Labour adviser who used to work as a civil servant at HM Revenue and Customs and then the Treasury, thinks the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism will turn out to be less generous than implied.Rishi Sunak is trying to save Britain from a mass unemployment crisis with a ‘turbocharged’ summer statement, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: Sunak called it “eat out to help out”, but the soundbite disguised a serious problem: after months of being told of the dangers of Covid-19, many consumers are now extremely wary of going out to cafes and bars even though restrictions are now being relaxed. The expected rush to the pub after last week’s reopening in England failed to materialise.Given that the chancellor has made the VAT cut time limited, there is a risk that spending will fall sharply when prices go back up next spring. This, though, is a gamble Sunak thinks is worth taking. The hope is that the economy will be through the worst by early 2021 and that the hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to cope by then."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4299232.1594216034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cao college applications for high points courses surge","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMore than 77,800 students applied for a college course this yearCollege applications for high-points courses such as law, veterinary medicine, dentistry and physiotherapy are up significantly this year, as students flock towards areas of study with strong job prospects.By contrast, the number of students applying for courses in areas such as arts, humanities and languages are down again this year.Overall, a total of just over 77,800 students have applied for a college course through the CAO this year.More than half adjusted their course choices during May and June, a period when it was announced that Leaving Cert exams were being replaced with calculated grades.Among the biggest year-on-year percentage increases in applications for honours degree courses were for physiotherapy (+25 per cent), dentistry (+17 per cent), veterinary medicine, law (+16 per cent).There were also increases in courses linked to the environment (+8 per cent), architecture (+8 per cent), secondary education (+7 per cent), medicine. pharmacy and engineering (+ 6 per cent).Some of the biggest decreases in applications were for humanities (-9 per cent), arts (-7 per cent), agriculture (-5 per cent), and art and design (-3 per cent).Rising unemployment and uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic may be attracting students towards courses with stronger employment prospects this year, according to some careers guidance experts.“Once again, we’re seeing that prospect of a solid job at the end of a course is a key driver, as opposed to exploring an area of education in arts and humanities,” said  career guidance columnist Brian Mooney.The surge in applications for high-points courses may also be a sign that students feel they have a better chance of securing more CAO points under the new calculated grades process, he said.“Some may well feel that, while they might not have achieved very high points in the traditional Leaving Cert exams, it might be a possibility with the new process. There’s also uncertainty about whether points for some high-points courses might fall this year due to fewer international students, so that could also be a factor.”There is still no firm date for when Leaving Cert students are set to receive their results and CAO offers, though decision-makers are aiming to release them as close as to the traditional mid-August date as possible.Mature, deferred and access applicants are due to receive “round A” offers on July 18th, while graduate-entry medicine applicants and applicants from further-education courses are due to receive “round 0” offers on August 8th.The latest CAO data shows that the vast majority of applications this year were for honours degree or level-eight courses (71,332), while half of applicants listed an ordinary degree course.In percentage terms, the highest increases in applications were for transport services (+89 per cent), though this category is one of the smallest and leads to dramatic swings in percentage.Similarly, the biggest decrease was in “interdisciplinary programmes and qualifications involving arts and humanities” (-23 per cent), though this also involves very small numbers."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Analysis confirms Covid-19 lockdown translated to short-term emissions reductions\u0026lsquoI intend to make substantial progress\u0026rsquo on securing our habitats, says Malcolm Noonan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impact"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Mr Naughten said Portiuncula Hospital in Co Galway was among the medical facilities with this problem.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government would consider Mr Naughten’s proposals. He said that despite the financial challenges the Government is honouring public service pay agreements this year and it also applied to frontline workers including An Garda Síochána.He also paid tribute to the frontline healthcare workers and said they put themselves at risk to help their fellow citizens.It demonstrated the value of a “very good quality public service”.The Taoiseach acknowledged the issue of patients waiting on hospital trolleys would be a major challenge for the health service over the coming months.This was in part due to the need to have enough isolation facilities for patients with coronavirus but they wanted to “resume non-Covid services as best we can”. The HSE will have a plan in place by the end of July for the resumption of these services, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4298742.1594158946!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord minister for agriculture tries to get himself out of the manure","story":"Minister for Agriculture Barry Cowen has told the Dáil he is profoundly sorry for a drink-driving offence in 2016. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Agriculture  Barry Cowen:  was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself. Photograph: PAIn an explosive debut, the new Dáil burst from the Leinster House blocks on Tuesday.The coalition’s first day in full session after Government formation brought with it the first abject apology from a Government Minister. That’s quite the start.And it came after a litany of embarrassing episodes for new Taoiseach Micheál Martin, busily concentrating on getting his administration up and running while his party colleagues busily concentrate on covering themselves in ignominy.Although his new Minister for Agriculture can’t be accused of not getting stuck in immediately. Barry Cowen is barely a wet week in his job and already he’s up to his oxters in manure. BabyBiff, brother of a former taoiseach Brian Cowen, was forced to make his inaugural statement to the Dáil in his new role all about himself.It was a deep, deep apology for a drink-driving offence committed four years ago (and saying nothing to his party leader about it) and getting a fine and a three-month ban. As it was at the lowest end of the scale, there was no requirement to go to court at the time.Full apologySo Cowen came into the chamber at 9pm and devoted his six-minute speaking slot to a full apology for his “grave error” and “lapse of judgment” and “stupid, stupid mistake”. There were no questions taken on his “misdemeanour”.While taking full responsibility for his one and only lapse into “the shame of drink-driving” and apologising all round him, he made no attempt to make excuses his action or minimise the gravity of the offence. But his carefully worded statement also referred to how reports on the original incident have now “extended to reporting various speeding and parking fines I have occurred over the years”.Many TDs would have collected similar penalties he intimated and he was clearly unhappy with these issues being “conflated” with the altogether different matter of drink-driving.“I have conducted a full examination of all records that I could obtain,” he informed the Dáil. After dredging though his motoring past he disclosed “a failure to display a tax disc while parked in Tullamore 14 years ago”.Cowen wants to get on with his job. “Now, formally, on the record of this House I sincerely want to apologise to my peers and my colleagues.”In the meantime, he has been very busy. Almost as busy as his boss who earlier told the House that he hasn’t “wasted an hour” since becoming Taoiseach.Cowen detailed all he has done since getting the new job in agriculture, before the premature onset of the manure. He has had made himself aware of the threat of Brexit, acquainted himself with the parlous state of the timber industry and already had the chats with commissioner Phil Hogan and his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Edwin Poots.You’d be worried letting Barry near a car after those conversations which would drive anyone to drink.A day when an attempt at a groundbreaking form of blended learning has entered its second week in Kildare Street. Early results are chaotic but largely inconclusive.It involves Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running a government together for the first time, with a large handful of Greens thrown in for leavening purposes. Whatever way the experiment turns out, it’s shaping up to be very entertaining. Sorry, educational.How will they get on? Hard to credit, but Tuesday’s sitting was the first with all the bells and whistles since the general election was called back in February.It was a huge occasion for Martin, who turned up in the chamber almost 10 minutes early for his first round of Leaders’ Questions as Taoiseach. The Fianna Fáil leader had already waited 31 years so an extra few minutes to savour the moment wasn’t going to make much difference.Oh, but Micheál was anxious to get his posterior into that coveted top seat, making a swift beeline towards it as soon as he got through the doors. He swerved to take the shortest route, only to be deftly erted by ushers onto the time-honoured walkway all around the top level of the circular chamber, and from thence down the stairs which end where he sits.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, in her elevated capacity as leader of the biggest Opposition party, took up position across the floor in the place recently vacated by the new Taoiseach. She also arrived in good time for the Dáil’s daily set piece. A big day for her party too – a nice change.Social distancingCardboard political place-settings were placed at intervals around the benches, setting out precisely where the TDs had to sit to comply with the extremely strict social distancing rules. There were very real fears that Mary Lou and Pearse Doherty might – through no fault of their own – thoroughly orchestrate a regulation-busting Sinn Féin crowd scene in their section, but they didn’t because this was Dublin and not west Belfast.The names on the place-settings changed since the curtailed sessions of previous weeks, when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs were given separate numbered spots. Now that the 33rd Dáil is under way, those two parties names have been replaced with the generic “Government” tag.Not a day assembled as a coalition in the old chamber and already the big two have lost their identities.On the other side of the floor, it was a case of high hopes and earplugs with Mary Lou finally earning first dibs on questioning a Taoiseach during Leaders’ questions. This is the most high-profile event of the Dáil day (except when a politician has to come in and make a grovelling apology for a lapse in standards).Then we had Cowen hauling himself in from the doghouse to beg forgiveness.Under normal circumstances, with BabyBiff’s tribulations added to the litany of Government howlers marking the start of Martin’s government, a scorching debut might have been expected from the steely Sinn Féin leader. But it was a subdued start from Mary Lou, who stuck to the issue of extended maternity leave and pay for new mothers who are facing particular difficulties are a result of the Covid-19 crisis.She expressed her concerns during two polite exchanges with the Taoiseach, who was equally concerned and polite.Micheál adopted a markedly different tone throughout his first Leaders’ Question, as if emphasising he was listening to the opposition during his time supporting the Fine Gael government and is going to be far more responsive than Leo Varadkar.Bout of hostilitiesAt the end of the first bout of hostilities between the Fine Gael and Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou’s response reflected her soft approach to this particular episode.“In that case, we are of one mind,” she told Micheál.That won’t happen too often. But then, following the embarrassing events for Sinn Féin in Belfast, it was probably wiser not to go drawing attention to the provisional route about licences and the like.Labour’s Alan Kelly took up the slack. He had no qualms reintroducing both the Government and Sinn Féin to recent embarrassments.When the sting of the last few weeks wear off for the main opposition, the Sinn Féin leader and the Labour leader will make a formidable team. They’ll be trying to outdo each other in knocking spots off Micheál.The Taoiseach will have to on stay on his toes."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Glory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsNorth Korea claims to have no cases of Covid-19 despite links with ChinaBeijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Health officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294866.1593715662!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the abrupt end to brexit talks is not only surprising but perplexing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoris Johnson: Has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations. Photograph:   Will OliverEPABut the language on both sides was restrained and Frost’s had none of the belligerence that often characterises his rhetoric towards Brussels. The fact that Barnier chose not to give a press conference was seen by some as another happy augury but it was in fact simply an act of deference towards Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, who were giving a joint press conference later.Before this week’s talks began, the EU told Britain it was ready to compromise in order to accommodate the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a video conference last month with the presidents of the European institutions.“The EU side had listened carefully to UK prime minister Boris Johnson’s statements in recent weeks, in particular, his request to reach a political agreement quickly, and his red lines: no role for the European Court of Justice in the UK no obligation for the UK to continue to be bound by EU law and an agreement on fisheries that shows Brexit makes a real difference,” Barnier said on Thursday.The Europeans hoped that Britain would respond with a step towards compromise of its own but by the time the talks ended on Thursday, Frost had produced no such offer. During the course of the week, it became clear that unless Britain makes a substantial move within days, there will be no significant progress this month.Judgment callJohnson this week named Frost as his next national security adviser and the chief negotiator’s word carries a rare level of authority in Downing Street. Last October, he successfully urged Johnson to accept the revised withdrawal agreement as the best available deal. He faces a similar judgment call today.The British red lines Barnier spoke about on Thursday are those Johnson identified in last month’s conference call. The two sides are also at odds over the governance structure but Johnson did not mention it on the call and British misgivings about signing up to a single overarching agreement have diminished. Some within the government recognise that it offers opportunities as well as risks.The issue of fisheries is highly charged politically on both sides but neither views a compromise as impossible. Although Britain rejects the concept of binding “level playing field” commitments, it will agree to maintain current employment, environmental and consumer standards.The toughest issue is state aid, with the EU calling for Britain to continue to follow EU rules on a continuing basis. This is problematic for Britain both because it limits the country’s freedom to subsidise indigenous industry and because it would give the ECJ a role in British economic policy.One obstacle in the way of a compromise is the fact that Britain has not yet set out plans for how it wants its own state aid regime to operate after the end of the transition period on December 31st. This leaves the EU unable to evaluate how a system of parallel state aid regimes would work, with both sides agreeing guidelines but regulating separately.While the British accuse the Europeans of being too legalistic, the Europeans complain about British amateurishness. But both sides agree that Johnson wants a deal and that he would like to get it as soon as possible.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there was talk around Westminster and Whitehall about how the crisis could reduce – or at least obscure – the impact of failure to agree a deal with the EU. But few now talk about the disruption of a no-deal outcome being lost within the greater disruption caused by coronavirus.Cost of no-dealBank of England governor Andrew Bailey said last week that the British government could have struggled to fund itself if the bank had not intervened with £200 billion of quantitative easing to buy government debt. The cost of a no-deal outcome to the EU talks, on top of the ballooning cost of the coronavirus crisis, would test either Bailey’s patience\u0026nbspor his credibility when he insists the bank is not underwriting the British government’s debt.Donald Trump’s declining political fortunes are also driving Johnson towards an EU deal as he prepares to deal with Joe Biden, a multilateralist whose advisers see Brexit as an expression of right-wing populism. As Suzanne Lynch has reported, Biden and his team are also acutely sensitive to any risk to the peace process and will monitor closely Britain’s implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol.Despite the fall in his approval ratings, Johnson remains in a very strong position with an 80-seat majority in parliament and no prospect of a general election until 2024. He has the immediate political scope to move either way on the negotiations but failure to reach a deal with the EU will make it harder for him to fulfil his government’s domestic agenda and to make a success of Brexit.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states.

The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

There is no end to the disruption in sight and realistically it could well be 2021 before confidence returns to the market.A riverboat service used by tourists and commuters will be rebranded Uber Boat by Thames Clippers later this summer as part of a deal with the ride-hailing app.Thames Clippers operates a service that runs through the city and includes stops along the river at Canary Wharf, the London Eye and Battersea Power Station.  Customers will be able to buy tickets on the Uber app alongside existing payment methods. The French resort of Les Arcs reopened on July 4 with a novel way of informing visitors about new social distancing rules.Signage on sanitiser stations around the mountain and village, which offers activities such as mountain biking, golf and walking in the summer months, used illustrations of goats as a key to educate guests.Keeping a goat’s distance apart is a guide to encourage people to observe the one-metre social distancing rule enforced by the French government.Joss Croft, the chief executive of UKinbound, a trade association representing inbound tourism in the UK, says the chancellor\u0027s economic recovery plan  clearly recognises the value of hospitality and tourism. Cutting VAT from 20 per cent to 5 percent  and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme will deliver immediate positive impacts for businesses and consumers.  The Job Retention Bonus Scheme will also help tourism and hospitality businesses, but only those that survive into next year.These measures will not help the many businesses involved in inbound tourism who drive regional economies and jobs, and who are on the brink longer-term support will still be required for these businesses, which have been hit even harder than domestic and outbound.UK holidaymakers outside of London risk having their flight options cut after new research showed some of Britain’s regional airports could lose routes due to the pandemic, reports Hugh Morris.Aviation experts OAG said Manchester Airport could face a battle to hold onto some of its long-haul services, while Stansted, in Essex, might also see airlines scrap destinations in an effort to stay viable. Becca Rowland, analyst at OAG, said the world’s biggest hubs could see route networks reduced but it is the “secondary” airports that face the greatest loss. Read the full story.Historic low VAT rate for hospitality and tourismWindsor Castle, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and parts of Buckingham Palace are to reopen to the tourists this summer, as the Royal Collection implements new Covid-safe protection, reports Hannah Furness.St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor CastleThe royal palaces will open to the public complete with hand sanitiser, one-way routes and perspex screens.The state apartments of Buckingham Palace itself, which usually welcomes tourists in the summer, will remain shut, with staff unable to build the annual infrastructure needed to cope with visitor numbers in time.Read the full story.Italy has called for new precautionary measures for passengers travelling to European Union countries from outside the bloc to curb the spread of Covid-19, Reuters reports.The country has suspended all flights from Bangladesh for a week following a number of passengers testing positive for the virus on a flight to Rome on Monday.“I would consider it appropriate to outline together new rigorous precautionary measures for arrivals from non-Schengen and non-EU areas,” Italy\u0027s health minister Roberto Speranza said in a letter addressed to the EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides and Germany’s health minister Jens Spahn.In Queen Square, Bristol, hearts have been sprayed onto the grass in an effort to encourage social distancing. Hearts mark the spotAs an industry, we’ve long been lobbying for reduced VAT to bring us in line with other European countries that already offer favourable rates to help drive tourism. Given the current crisis the clamour for this within the UK has grown – and it’s fantastic to see the Government respond so positively.The reduction will provide businesses operating on wafer thin margins with some essential breathing space, helping them to recover and rebuild, as well as to retain more jobs – with the £1,000 job retention scheme offering yet further assistance here. The additional announcement of the ‘Eat out to help out’ vouchers is yet another much needed and very welcome boost, and it’s a move that, will not only help businesses, but should also help to encourage consumers to return.Wearing a face mask is not a magic bullet in preventing the spread of coronavirus, the First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has said.He said the Welsh Government would keep the guidance on the wearing of face masks in public under review.Face masks are not currently mandatory in Wales, but their use is recommended in places like public transport. They are mandatory on public transport in England and Scotland, and also in shops in Scotland. The Winter Palace in St Petersburg, home to the Hermitage, is to reopen in a week\u0027s time, on July 15.The vast museum has been closed for four months due to the coronavirus pandemic. A member of staff in the Hermitage Read more: \u0027Lockdown is murder\u0027 in a city desperate for the return of touristsMore from Rishi Sunak on his plans for the UK hospitality industry. He told the Commons he wants to see pubs, restaurants, cafes and B\u0026ampBs bustling again, telling MPs:At the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at 20 per cent. So I\u0027ve decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.Beginning from next Wednesday until January 12, VAT will be reduced from 20 per cent to five per cent on purchases including eat-in food, hotels, cinemas, theme-parks and zoos, Rishi Sunak has announced.The Chancellor has also announced everyone will get an eat out to help out discount throughout August. Meals will be half price for everyone in the country, at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday. A maximum discount of £10 per head, he says. Villanelle, the glamorous assassin from the BBCs Killing Eve, has lived in enviable quarters throughout the series. The latest is an Art Nouveau flat in Barcelona, which is now available to rent on Airbnb. Listed on the booking platform for $285 a night, it was originally designed in 1906 and is described as usual and very spacious.Spain was included on the Government list of travel corridors, meaning Britons can travel to the country without facing quarantine on their return (if they arrive back here on July 10).Australia\u0027s second-largest city goes back into lockdown today following a spike in cases. Christian Bonetto reports from the city. Residents have been panic-buying loo rollAfter successfully flattening the curve, a sudden spike in locally acquired infections has had the city on edge for the last three weeks. In response, 10 Melbourne postcodes – declared coronavirus hotspots – were placed back in lockdown on July 1. This was soon followed by a swift, hard lockdown of nine council-housing towers in the city’s inner northwest.On July 7, Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews dropped a further bombshell: the state had recorded 191 new infections, the highest daily increase in the state since the pandemic began. By late afternoon on Tuesday, the news we had all expected was merely confirmed: Greater Melbourne would enter a second lockdown from 11:59pm the following night. Most of regional Victoria would be spared the same fate.Read the full story.British holidaymakers have rated Virgin and Ryanair among the worst companies for handling refunds for cancelled trips during the coronavirus pandemic. Just 4 per cent of Ryanair, Love Holidays and Virgin Holidays customers said they had a full refund, in the Money Saving Expert survey of over 77,000 people.  The survey also found:Teletext Holidays and Virgin Atlantic had a refund payout rate of 1 per cent among people whose trips had been cancelledSome 87 per cent of Jet2 and Jet2holidays customers with cancelled bookings said they received refundsTrailfinders and Airbnb customers were also likely to get a refund 85 per cent and 83 per cent respectively had been refundedAirbnb had the shortest time in handling refunds 87 per cent received money within two weeksOthers to issue quick refunds included:  Jet2holidays (57  per cent within two weeks), British Airways (56 per cent) and Jet2 (55 per cent)Telegraph Travel writer Lottie Gross has been reporting from Mallorca.

Visitors do not need to self-quarantine or be tested for Covid-19. However, the country is not featured on the UK Government\u0027s list of travel corridors or the list of destinations exempt from the FCO warning against all but essential travel.The Government has given the green light to overseas holidays. As of July 7, the FCO no longer advises against trips to 66 destinations, while 59 countries can now be visited by Britons without the need to self-isolate on their return.Confusingly, however, some nations appear on one list, but not the other. Many countries included on both lists still have their own restrictions in place. New Zealand, for example, could remain closed to foreign tourists until next year, while Cyprus is blocking all UK arrivals.Nevertheless, 24 places (23 in Europe and one beyond) appear on both lists, and are welcoming UK travellers.See the full list. An Estonian traveller is asking to be rescued from the departures area of Manila airport in the Philippines, where he has been living for more than 100 days.Roman Trofimov arrived in the country on March 20 on an AirAsia flight from Bangkok and, due to the coronavirus pandemic, has been stuck there since.He had been travelling in south-east Asia and arrived in Manila, but his passport was taken before going through immigration.AirAsia was unable to return him to Thailand.Mr Trofimov was denied entry into the Philippines because entry visas were no longer being issued for arrivals. He asked his embassy for help but they were unable to organise a repatriation flight.Mr Trofimov has been sleeping in an airport departures hotel room and living on food and snacks donated by staff.There are significant levels of consumer concern about the Covid-19 infection risks of flying, research suggests. A survey for the International Air Transport Association (Iata) in major airline markets, including the UK, Germany, France and the US, found three out of five respondents had avoided air travel and one-third would avoid flying in future to avoid catching the virus.All respondents had travelled by plane in the past 12 months.Some 65 per cent of consumers were concerned about sitting next to someone who might be infected,  two in five were concerned about using toilets, with 37 per cent fearful of breathing the air on the plane.Passengers\u0027 major concerns at airports were being in a crowded bustrain to the aircraft, queuing at check-insecurityborder control or boarding and using airport toilets. The survey of 4,700 consumers in 11 countries was carried out in June. The poppies, daisies and cornflowers emerge annually alongside the lentil crop on the Umbrian plain of Castelluccio.

Certainly no-one I spoke to yesterday about the crippling effects of being put on the British red list was laughing.Jorge Beldade, Director of Operations at Minor Hotels in the Algarve, responsible for Europe’s first Anantara, told me: “Because of the disproportionately bad publicity this has brought us, due to a few, controlled, clusters far away in Lisbon, we have had an enormous amount of cancellations.” The hotel, whose occupancy is normally around 45 per cent British, is currently seeing three per cent of bookings from that market, and has been forced to postpone its re-opening from July 1 to July 20.At family-friendly Martinhal, with hotels in Cascais and the western Algarve, it is a similar story, although both properties are now open. “Cancellations have increased,” owner Chitra Stern explained, “and new enquiries have decreased. We are looking at an occupancy fluctuating between 10 per cent and 20 per cent right now with a huge drop in our strong British market. But the ones who have decided to come feel comfortable in their private pool villas and the outdoor activities, from surfing to hiking, that Portugal excels in.”Read the full story.Australia\u0027s second-largest city returning to lockdown with a stay-at-home order in effect for the next six weeks following a spike in coronavirus cases. Five million residents were ordered back into lockdown beginning midnight Wednesday into Thursday as soaring community transmission of the coronavirus brings more than 100 new cases daily.The border between Victoria and New South Wales, the country\u0027s two most populous states, was closed on Tuesday for the first time in 100 years as authorities attempt to contain an outbreak of the virus in Melbourne.Read our latest advice on when you can travel to Australia.New York City moved into the third phase of its easing of lockdown measures on Tuesday. Nail and tanning salons, tattoo parlours, spas and massages, dog runs and many other outdoor activities are allowed to resume under the third stage of the four-phase plan to reduce restrictions. The National Gallery reopens today, making it London\u0027s first major art museum to reopen its doors after closing in late March. Visitors will be asked to wear masks and social distancing and advance booking are mandatory. The gallery expects around a quarter of the usual number of visitors - or 3,000 to 4,000 people per day.Opening hours have been reduced from eight to five,  although on Friday they will be extended to 10 hours.We had two primary objectives, said the gallery\u0027s chief operating officer Paul Gray. One was to make sure that we made visitors feel safe and that we reassured them but equally we wanted to make it an enjoyable experience.Read The \u0027s first look at the gallery\u0027s

currently experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, a study has revealed.Countries including Argentina, Chile and Colombia bucked a trend that saw the volume of bitcoin trading drop globally between 2019 and 2020.Cryptocurrency trades on the LocalBitcoins platform fell by more than a third in total – falling from £537 million to £337m – but rose in volume by nearly a quarter in Chile and more than doubled in Argentina.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesData gathered by investment publication Invezz revealed the dramatic impact the coronavirus has had on bitcoin trading. The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.An ancient naked man sculpted into a chalk hillside in Dorset is unlikely to be prehistoric as was once believed, archaeologists have said.The Cerne Abbas giant may only be a few hundred years old, say researchers whose investigations into the age of the 180ft figure received assistance from a surprising source: snails.Shells unearthed at the site of Britain’s largest chalk figure – depicted brandishing a club and, notoriously, a 35ft erect penis – indicate the artwork could not have been carved any earlier than medieval times, they added.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFragments of snail species that first arrived in the country in the 13th and 14th centuries were discovered in soil samples contemporaneous with the giant.The National Trust, which owns the site, and researchers from the University of Gloucestershire began tests earlier this year to determine the age of the giant, whose origins and purpose remain shrouded in mystery.Tests of soil samples extracted from the hillside have been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results not expected until later this year.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to StonehengeBut separate analysis by environmental archaeologist Mike Allen of tiny snail shell fragments found at the site suggest the giant “may have been a rather more recent addition to the Dorset landscape than some have suggested”.No trace of species brought over by the Romans from France as food were found at the site, but microscopic fragments of snails thought to have arrived accidentally in packing straw  from Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries were discovered.This suggests the figure “may not be prehistoric, nor even Roman, but may belong to more recent times”, wrote Mr Allen and the National Trust’s Martin Papworth in the magazine Current Archaeology.A National Trust spokesperson told The Independent the archaeologists had made “tentative early suggestions about the age of the Cerne Abbas giant” but that “full analysis is ongoing and results will be made available as soon as possible”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailMr Papworth said full soil sample test results would likely indicate “a date range, rather than a specific age, but we hope they will help us better understand, and care for, this famous landmark”.The earliest recorded mention of the giant, gifted to the National Trust by the Pitt-Rivers family 100 years ago, was in 1694.Theories about its origins range from an ancient fertility symbol and likeness of Greco-Roman hero Hercules to a caricature of Oliver Cromwell.Brian Edwards, a historian at UWE Bristol, suggested the artwork may have been created in the late 17th century by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, the future third Earl of Shaftesbury, and used as a propaganda tool depicting King William III as Herculean.Other researchers believe the giant could have been carved by local landowner and MP, Baron Holles of Ifield, a bitter foe of Cromwell, and see the club as a reference to repressive rule and the phallus a mockery of the republican leader’s Puritanism.Gordon Bishop, chair of the Cerne Historical Society, previously said Cerne Abbbas villagers were keen to know the truth about the local landmark.“Although there are some who would prefer the giant’s age and origins to remain a mystery, I think the majority would like to know at least whether he is ancient or no more than a few hundred years old. Whichever may be the case, he is unique,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He said this would benefit nine in ten homebuyers, saving £4,500 on average.“Uncertainty abounds in the market – a market we need to be thriving,” he told MPs.The chancellor said employers that bring back an inidual who was furloughed during the coronavirus lockdown – and continuously employ them until the start of the new year – will be paid a £1,000 bonus per employee. He said the cost of the bonus scheme would cost £9bn if all employers took full advantage.‘Kickstart scheme’ for young peopleThe new scheme will directly pay employers to create new jobs for any 16-24 year-olds “at risk of long-term unemployment” due to the crisis, Mr Sunak said. The chancellor insisted these jobs, with a minimum of 25 hours per week, will paid at least the government’s national minimum wage. It is expected iniduals will be in the first jobs by the autumn, with an initial £2bn set aside for the scheme. “If employers meet these conditions, we will pay young people’s wages for six months, plus and amount to cover overheads,” he told MPs.Meal vouchers for all citizensIn an attempt to get customers back into restaurants, bars and cafes as the lockdown eases the chancellor announced everyone in the country will be eligible for “Eat Out to Help Out” vouchers. Meals eaten at businesses participating in the scheme, which will run Monday to Wednesday’s next month, will be 50 per cent off per head, Mr Sunak said.“Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday. Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five days.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The provincial agricultural department said in a statement that the dog meat trade had descended into “anarchy” in recent years, causing rabies and other diseases to spread from region to region.The department said in a statement that the “catching, buying, selling and slaughtering of dogs” would be punished “severely”, with maximum penalties including five years in prison and fines of up to 50 million riel (approximately £9,700).Dr Katherine Polak, head of Four Paws, said: “The historic decision by the Siem Reap government to ban the stealing, trading and killing of dogs is a huge milestone for animal welfare in Cambodia and is reflective of current sentiment among Khmer people.UN warns of ‘steady stream’ of infectious zoonotic diseases‘If we don’t buy, they don’t die’: Tackling the wildlife trade demandCan social media be weaponised against the illegal wildlife trade?Prince William backs report to ‘end the illegal wildlife trade’Yulin Dog Meat Festival: How did it start and will it get banned?“We hope that Siem Reap will serve as a model for the rest of the country to follow suit to protect the lives of millions of dogs.”The dog meat industry in Cambodia sees an estimated three million dogs slaughtered for consumption annually. Thousands of animals are transported from Siem Reap to different parts of the country each month, including to the capital, Phnom Penh.Tea Kimsoth, director of the provincial agriculture, forestry and fisheries department, told Reuters that demand for the meat was driven by foreigners, especially South Korean visitors to the country.“They like it, that’s why it led to restaurants serving it, so now we ban it,” he said, adding that the trade was “alarming”.The Cambodian province’s decision follows China recent ban on the sale of dog and cat meat. The animals were kept in poor conditions, making them vulnerable to disease that could be transmitted to humans, said activists.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But that first group is much larger.#Boris Johnson spoke to German chancellor Angela Merkel today and told her that the UK #would be ready# to leave the transition period at the end of the year without a trade deal with the EUone cannot be agreed.“On the future relationship, the prime minister underlined the UK’s commitment to working hard to find an early agreement out of the intensied talks process,” a Downing Street spokeswoman said. “He also noted that the UK equally would be ready to leave the transition period on Australia termsan agreement could not in the end be reached.”Australia does not have a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU.Much of EU-Australia trade follows default World Trade Organisation rules, though specic agreements are in place for certain goods, Reuters reports.Michel Barnier has opened the door for City businesses to access EU markets after Brexit.Giving evidence to the House of Lords European Union committee, Mr Barnier hinted that the EU was ready to unilaterally give access to some UK financial companies. “We are ready to grant equivalence,” he said. “The time for decisions is in the autumn, in good time, in the global context of our negotiations on many subjects with the UK.”It comes as one-to-one negotiations with David Frost started in London today.Tomorrow the two negotiating teams will meet in Whitehall for more informal talks.Ineos Automotive is considering scrapping its plan to build a car plant in Wales, the manufacturer has announced.The firm said it is in talks with Mercedes-Benz over acquiring the German companys Hambach factory in Moselle, France, instead of building new facilities in Bridgend and Portugal.Production of a new #

The big aim was to save lives and protect the vulnerable.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesI doubt it occurred to many parents that schools would be closed for nearly FOUR months, and counting, or that they were about to take a pivotal role in educating their own children.But that is what has happened. And I know from friends with school-aged children that it has been, shall we say, a bit challenging.So I want to dedicate this column to the hundreds of thousands of parents who became home-educators overnight — with a particular shout out to the “lucky” ones who had to do this while also doing their regular jobs.Trying to educate your child, with no idea of when schools will reopen, and at the same time as trying to do justice to your day job, is seriously hard and my hat comes off to all of you.Now that the UK is slowly unlocking, there are many working parents who face the prospect of having to go back to their jobs.Some have children back at school until the end of term. But it is fair to say that no one is in an ideal situation.It has been a slog for everyone — and what we all need is a holiday. But with all the chaos and uncertainty surrounding trips abroad, and most UK holiday homes and campsites now already booked up, many of us will have been lucky to plan any kind of trip.More pressingly, many of the children’s holiday clubs people rely on are closed. After all, try telling a bunch of seven-year-olds to stay socially distant during a game of football.Many families rely on grand- parents to fill the childcare gaps during school holidays.But even though restrictions have eased, lots of grandparents will have underlying health conditions that make it unsafe for them to venture out.They will be stuck at home, missing family and unable to help out with childcare.In short, there is an army of working parents out there, already on their knees after four months of combining school and work, who now face their kids having seven more weeks off school, with no structure and support.What are working parents to do  This is a really tough situation for families.There are some basic things that parents can do to make le easier — and right at the top of that list is to lower your standards.Very few things are so important that they cannot wait until tomorrow. No one died because the house was not Hoovered.One thing I do know is that when you are working all the hours God sends and looking after kids, “me time” is almost impossible. But when you are firing on all cylinders, it is all too easy to burn out.So my advice for this particular Sunday is this — try to find even just one hour to go for a walk or meet a friend.Or find a corner where no one can bother you, and read a book, do some yoga, have a bath and pour yourself a cup of tea or a glass of wine.The rest of the world can go hang while you recharge your batteries and live to fight another day.Parenting is the hardest job in the world at the best of times. It does not come with a manual or instructions. It is relentless and you get very little thanks.The rewards are happy, healthy, balanced adults — but that comes -plus years later.If you are struggling, remember this — it will pass. Meanwhile, take it a day at a time and hang in there. You are doing a sterling job.The BBC has found the perfect solution to lockdown filming, with their revival of Alan Bennett’s Talking Heads series of monologues.No need to worry about social-distancing with a cast of one.And Killing Eve star Jodie Comer playing a part first performed by Julie Walters in the s in Her Big Chance, was brilliant.She is a fantastic actor, as we well know from Killing Eve, and this performance demonstrated her versatility, too.Did you see those pictures of Loose Women star Nadia Sawalha, who is , stripping down to her underwear If you did, then you may well have uttered the word: “Why ”But she wanted to show what women really look like, and to demonstrate the power that a filter, camera angle and ious other cunning techniques can have in efforts to make women look more “perfect”.When you think about the multiple images of “perfection” that women are subjected to daily, you realise that unless there is a visible antidote to this – actual evidence that real women are not perfect after all – we will never change the pressure we are under.So, good on you, Nadia.This was a successful attempt to highlight the degree to which the camera does, indeed, lie – but also the pressure we are all under to distort normality.I know many people who look great in photos but normal in real le.That feeling of need to alter your image can be a sort of self-hatred. It also fuels others’ need to airbrush themselves, so that all of us risk becoming unrecognisable in real le.The problem with altering your image is that you are fooling precisely no one.What is far better is to love yourself, no matter what you look like.Seeking adulation from people you don’t know and will never meet is a fool’s game because it will never, ever pay idends.It’s so easy to indulge in regret – but this is also a fool’s game.Anyone tempted by its lure needs to take a leaf out of Pierce Brosnan’s book.He said this week he has “no regret” after being told over the phone that he was being replaced in his role as James Bond.The actor, now , had his last outing as  in Die Another Day in  – and although he was eager to do a fth film, producers decided they wanted to reboot the role.Instead of feeling bitter and resentful, he said: “There’s no regret. I do not let regret come into my world . . . it just leads to more misery and more regrets.”Pierce is one of those actors who really has mastered the art of growing old gracefully – a le goal for all of us.He is a gorgeous man and comes across as a genuinely nice guy.Oh, and judging from recent photos, he could still play Bond now.I know many people have been disappointed they are having to scale back plans for big summer weddings.If you’ve been arranging the biggest and best day of your le, you might be wondering whether it’s better to just postpone altogether.For what it’s worth, I have some advice. It really is just a day. Yes, it should be lovely but it’s not the wedding that is important – it’s what happens afterwards.By that, I mean the rest of your married le together.It’s easy to get caught up with expectation and convention but maybe this is a chance to think about what you really want and what matters to you as a couple.You may also realise thatyou marry at the moment there can be no first dance – a tradition surely conceived during the s when couples don’t have sex before marriage – and a cause for celebration.The local lockdown in Leicester is a stark reminder that the next few months, and maybe years, could bring plenty more of the same. Anywhere.When this does happen, we will all have to do our bit.But hearing garment manufacturers in Leicester saying it will defy the city’s lockdown shines a light on what, for some, is the nub of the matter – for so many people, lockdown equals a loss of income.They cannot afford to lose any more money, evenit means putting lives at risk.That is going to be a real problem. But staying open “evenit puts lives at risk” is a cavalier and dangerous attitude.If you own a factory, it is your job to make sure your workers are safe.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many could be thrown on the “scrapheap” and those trying to build a new career will find it tougher than ever to get a foothold on the jobs ­ladder.The impact of unemployment will blight their future, as the knock-on effects — including hopelessness and alienation — will last a letime.The Government has a simple choice this week: Either invest now to ensure youngsters have the training and skills needed to meet the challenges ahead, or we will all pick up the pieces later.That means laying the ground for real apprenticeships and work ­experience, with proper jobs at the end of them. There should be more opportunity to continue learning, developing the knowledge and skills required to land a job or, better still, become a future entrepreneur.We should seize the opportunity to create new jobs in the regions by regenerating the North and the Midlands, including tackling climate change, housing and construction, and the added social care challenges of supporting an ageing population.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"The Chancellor should also work with business and the trade unions to recruit , employers willing to assist, by offering them incentives and subsidies, including help with National Insurance and pension contributions.Additionally, existing underspends and the Apprenticeship Levy, together with potential benefit payments, should be topped up to create a £billion fund to meet the challenge of a record ­million under-s predicted to be out of work by Christmas. This is not just a matter of hard-headed public policy.It is about the lives of every inidual and their chances of building a future for themselves, developing a family of their own and contributing to their community. It is about what ­happens when aimlessness turns either into apathy or, more likely, into what my grandfather would have described as the danger of “idle hands”.History has taught us that society begins to unravel when young men without prospects, stability or the capacity to provide a role model become an unattractive prospect as a lelong partner.The future is grim when young women feel that they alone carry the responsibility of nurturing a child, and when a lack of prospects and progress to something better leads to a “live today and to hell with tomorrow” attitude.Former Conservative minister Lord Willetts has written and spoken convincingly about the danger of the generational ide.His honest reflections of how the austerity measures put in place in  hit younger people hardest, and how the protected ­pensions of the past, combined with the enormous rise in property values, have placed the majority of older people in a more favourable place to face the future showed great insight.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Young people lack the prospects of a secure job and either owning their own home or affording the rent.That is why we should face this challenge head-on and invest now, or we will pick up the cost later.In , during the early days of the New Labour government, our New Deal for the young unemployed offered four options.Not surprisingly, the bulk of young people went for either jobs with ­training attached or full-time education, which would lead to much better prospects of holding on to a job with decent earnings.Another lesson learnt, including in -, was that much of what needed to be done should be localised.The tendency to over-centralise ­everything has bedevilled us in this crisis.From the failure to devolve test-and-trace to local government through to months of ineptitude in ­getting our children back to school, the Government has classically created a central bureaucracy then blamed it for failure.While it has done the right thing in investing money in recovery ­programmes for our children over the winter, astonishingly, it failed to put any money in for recovery for those  to -year-olds in further education in sixth-form colleges.These are the young people whose vocational training and practical ­opportunities for work will be vital both for the economic recovery and for their own chances of getting a job.After all, you cannot promise a ­guarantee of apprenticeships or work experiencea business has folded.The Government needs to work with and listen to young people, employers and those in education and training.Unfashionable as it is at this moment to talk about universities, it is crucial that those capable of taking up such opportunities should be supported in doing so.If we don’t, they will be the ones who take the jobs of those less qualied and less confident.The result is simple. The least educated and the most vulnerable will be the ones to lose out most.Thinking these things through ­carefully, being able to act decisively and learning from the past, while not living in it, is surely common sense.And by God, we need a great deal more of that right now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The scheme will also pay for businesses to take on apprentices over the age of  with a bonus of £,.He said he refused to allow young people - hit hard by the economic impact coronavirus - become a lost generation of workers. He said: Today, we act, with a plan for jobs. Our plan has a clear goal: to protect, support and create jobs.It will give businesses the confidence to retain and hire.To create jobs in every part of our country. To give young people a better start. To give people the opportunity of a fresh start.”The announcement comes after growing fears young peoples earnings could be permanently scarred because of lockdown, and the IPPR think-tank forecast unemployment for under-s could double to just over one million by the end of . Mr Sunak added: In particular the help we want to provide for those who will be hardest hit by this crisis: younger people. Over , people are leaving education this year. Many more are just starting out in their careers. Coronavirus has hit them hard - under s are two and a half times as likely to work in a sector that has been closed.If the first phase of our economic phase was about protection, and the second phase today is about jobs, there will come a third phase to rebuild. He vowed the Government would heal the wounds of the coronavirus pandemic. The Apprenticeship Levy already incentivises large firms to take on apprentices, but small firms will now also be given a cash bonus for taking them on. The scheme to boost apprentice roles for young people is in addition to plans to get more firms to take on trainees for  weeks -  months by offering them £, for every trainee. The Chancellor announced today: The Chancellor said there would be extra support to sector-based work academies, who provide training and work placements. The scheme will get young people into work and stay in work, Mr Sunak said  per cent of apprentices stay in work or do further training afterwards. The massive cut to VAT announced by the Chancellor will allow Brits to eat out at half price, for up to £ discount per head from Monday-Wednesday in August. But it will also help protect jobs - primarily young and low earners. Around , businesses are eligible for the scheme dubbed Eat Out to Help Out and is designed to support . million jobs which are disproportionately young, female and part-time workers. The entire package was part of a three-stage coronavirus economic recovery programme. The first stage - laid out at the start of lockdown - protected jobs and businesses from going under as the country closed up shop. This next stage announced today aims to create a bridge to ensure furloughed workers arent laid off across the country and people who missed out on opportunities were able to find them. Boris Johnsons promise to level up Britain set to be announced in the Autumn budget will form the final stage to help rebuild the nation. Matthew Lesh, Head of Research at the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, welcomed the initiatives to help young people. He said: The Covid- virus harms older people the most, but the economic lockdown is destroying le opportunities for young people. They are losing jobs in hospitality and retail and will find it harder to get onto the jobs ladder, risking a long-term loss of income. The Government is rightly focusing on getting young people into real jobs, rather than establishing expensive make-work schemes. This wage subsidy scheme will get many young people onto the job ladder, building skills that will make them employable in the future.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whatever the reasons, we need to overcome our reservations and wear face coverings whenever we are around others in public.“It used to be quite normal to have quite a few drinks and drive home, and it also used to be normal to drive without seatbelts. Today, both of those would be considered antisocial, and not wearing face coverings in public should be regarded in the same way.”He said the use of masks lowers the chance of future surge and lockdowns which are “economically and psychologically disruptive”.His comments come after new research was released that detailed the effectiveness of the use of face masks and coverings.One study, by the Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemicsgroup said masks could reduce the risk of transmission and can also provide benefits to those who wear them.While another paper from the Royal Society’s Science in Emergencies Tasking Covid- group, highlighted how behind the UK was compared to other countries.It claims that in April the uptake of people wearing a mask in the UK was  per cent.It claimed that countries such as Italy had a . per cent uptick, while the US had . per cent and Spain had . per cent.Prof Ramakrishnan said masks need to be treated like any other item of clothing and added that we need to get used to wearing them.Speaking on BBC Radio ’s Today programme this week, he added: I think what we would like for the Government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than two metres away from the next person.If youre in a crowded setting, you ought to wear a mask.He said outdoors was less of a problem for transmission and that mask-wearing was largely required in indoor settings.Charities have also warned that there are exemptions to the rules and said that not everyone is physically able to wear a mask or covering.The government previously released guides on how to make coverings at home from old t-shirts.Downing Street stressed the need for people to wear face coverings properly, covering both the nose and mouth and a spokesperson for the Prime Minister said a wider roll out is always under reviewWe have been very clear about the benefits of people wearing face coverings.Face coverings can help us protect others and reduce the spread of the viruspeople are infected but not showing symptoms.Highlighting the correct way to wear a mask they added: Covid- is a respiratory disease. If someone has the virus, droplets can leave the nose and month and infect others when someone breathes, speaks, sneezes, laughs or coughs.Therefore, a face covering should cover both the nose and mouth to reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets, helping to protect others. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s delightful company and easy on the eye. Also, I’m not sure she’s a witch. We could do a drowning test first. Thoughts  PS: I have a pool.”Depp continues the shocking rhetoric, adding: Let’s drown her before we burn her. I will f*** her burnt corpse afterwards to make sure she’s dead.”Bettany then replies: “My thoughts entirely. Let’s be certain before we pronounce her a witch.”Grilled about the exchange today, Depp admitted it wasnt the most respectful way to talk about the actress.But he said Heard was very aggressive and quite insulting about my use of alcohol or cocaine.Depp added: She was constantly harping on about things that didn’t exist. She didn’t like me using alcohol or drugs because she had some delusional idea that they turned me into a monster.”He is continuing his evidence after making a string of shocking revelations when he took to the stand yesterday.Among the explosive new claims made in court today was that Depp slapped Heard three times in a drunken rage after she mocked him for his wino forever tattoo.It originally read Winona Forever - but Depp changed it to Wino Forever after he split up with his Edward Scissorhands co-star as it seemed fitting.But he is said to have slapped Heard three times after he had fallen off the wagon following  days sobriety.Sasha Wass QC, representing The Sun, said today: You became frustrated with Ms Heard’s mocking and you slapped Ms Heard across the face in March .“It was the first time you had used violence against her. You slapped her more than once because she didn’t react at first and that made you even more angry.”Depp replied: “It’s not true. It didn’t happen. That is patently untrue.”Ms Wass continued: “It was an outburst of anger on your part and you came to your senses and broke down. You started crying and apologising and said you wouldn’t hit her again.Depp said: “I’m sorry but that’s not the truth. You are mistaken. I did not hit Ms Heard.”The court was also told how Depp was meant to be filming a documentary about The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards the next day when he started snorting more and more lines of cocaine.Heard, who had obviously been crying, and her sister Whitney Henriquez tried for four hours to get Depp to make his way to the set but he refused to leave, it was claimed.Whitney claimed when she arrived at the home the next morning, Depp had been downing whiskey and there was broken glass and cigarette butts littering the floor.The court was read extracts of text messages between the pair after they first started dating in March .One written by Depp reads: Just thought you should know, there exists a book entitled Disco Bloodbath. That is all.Heard replies: We need that book… is it about last Friday night by any chance Depp then asks how she can make him smile at such a hideous moment, before ending the message: I f***ing love you, you c***.Just days before the exchange, Heard claims Depp hit her several times after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree, which was hanging in her bedroom, it was said.He was accused of becoming obsessed with the idea Heard was having an affair with her ex-girlfriend and denied he tried to remove the artwork and set fire to it.His jealousy was referred to again when Depp allegedly trashed a trailer in a drug-fuelled rage when one of Heards pals touched her sexually.Ms Wass said: You started to get angry, the monster joined the party and you took exception to a woman who was in your group called Kelly Sue.You actually became extremely angry with Kelly Sue and became quite unpleasant, shouting at her and eventually saying to her, do you know how much pressure it would take to break your wrist But Depp fired back: I removed Miss Kelly Sues hand from Ms Heards body and told her not to do that.Ms Wass also referred to an incident where Depp held Heards tiny Yorkshire terrier out a car window and began making howling noises.He was said to have later laughed at a running joke about putting the pooch in a microwave.The barrister said: When you were in the car, you were smoking and you opened the window and you were angry and you were aggressive, rather like you were in that clip we saw yesterday - the monster side of your character.And you took hold of Pistol and you held her out of the window and started making howling noises.The actor responded: I can say it is a very endearing image, but it is absolute utter falsity, it is fraudulent.Heard smiled as she arrived for day two of the showdown today after pulling her red bandana down for the waiting photographers.She looked smart in a black belted dress and waved as she made her way up the steps to the entrance of the court.Depp also appeared in a good mood as he beamed at the waiting crowds.The star showed off his many tattoos as he pointed up at the sky before disappearing inside the court for another day of grilling.In an email written by Heard to Depp, which was never sent, Heard told him: I just dont knowI can do this anymore. It is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me. I cant take him. I wish I could, but I cant. The problem is, I never really know understand which one Im dealing with until its too late.The drinking assures me that I am dealing with the monster. The abused, scared, insecure, violent little boy. I just cant tell where the line starts.Depp was yesterday accused of turning his rage and frustration on Heard, , when he failed to control his drug and alcohol abuse.He descended into physically destructive behaviour - causing him to refer to his drunken and violent persona as the monster, it was said.The revelations made in yesterdays bombshell opening:But in a series of explosive revelations Depp made during evidence yesterday, the star branded Heards abuse allegations complete lies.And he called his ex-we “calculating, sociopathic and emotionally dishonest” as he lted the lid on their tumultuous relationship.Depp told the court Heard severed his finger during a trip to Australia in  by throwing a vodka bottle at him and accused her of repeatedly punching him in the face.He also bizarrely claimed he resolved to orce the actress after finding her poo in the bed.The Hollywood wildchild also laid bare his chaotic Tinsel Town lestyle - includingmega pints of wine for breakfast and a £, monthly booze bill.Depp admitted he first took drugs aged just  - and had tried every substance known to man just three years later.He also told the court he emailed Sir Elton John to celebrate  days sober - and referred to his brain and liver resembling Mrs Thatcher.Depp has brought separate libel proceedings against Heard in the US.The couple married in LA in  after meeting on the set of comedy The Rum Diary.But they orced two years later after Heard, who donated her £.million settlement to charity, accused Depp of abuse.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And at the centre of his summer statement is a £bn aposKickstartapos programme to subsidise hundreds of thousands of work placements for under-s. It comes after youth unemployment soared in the crisis with the number of under-s claiming Universal Credit doubling. The scheme is eerily reminiscent of one Labour set up  years ago - and which the Tories scrapped  years ago. But while unions brand the plan a “good first step”, itaposs not full-blown jobs and it doesnapost have all the answers. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds demanded the government go further and extend furlough beyond October for the worst-hit sectors. She said: “The Government is yet to rise to the scale of the unemployment crisis. The priority is to prevent additional unnecessary unemployment in the first place. So what is the Kickstart scheme, how will it work and who can apply  Hereaposs everything you need to know. How does the Kickstart scheme work  People aged  to  on Universal Credit will be eligible for six-month work placements funded by the government. The state will fund employers to take people on, to the tune of % of the minimum wage for  hours a week. Firms, which can top up wages beyond thatthey want to, get a £, admin fee. The scheme applies throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland will receive separate funding.  You wonapost be rolling in it. The government-funded element only covers the National Minimum Wage for  hours a week. The minimum wage is currently £. an hour for those aged -, £. for those aged -, or £. for - and -year-olds. So that means the most guaranteed pay any one Kickstarter can get over the entire six months is about £,. That falls to just under £, for people aged  or . Firms can choose to top up these wagesthey want. But they donapost have to. Who is eligible to apply  The scheme is open to people aged between - who are claiming Universal Credit and at risk of long-term unemployment. A Treasury official said: These people will be identied by DWP work coaches, using a flexible and tailored approach to assess the inidual’s needs.  How many people can apply  The Treasury expects more than , people to be able to join the scheme at first. In total, as of May there were almost , young people aged  and under on Universal Credit - double the figure just a few months ago. How long will it go on for   The scheme will be open to funding applications from August , and the first jobs will begin in the autumn. Treasury officials say the scheme will be initially open until December . What sort of firms will these jobs be in  The government hasnapost yet specied where the jobs will be. They could be in fast food outlets, shops or offices, or all of the above - itaposs not clear yet. The scheme will be open to all types of business. Informal discussion with employers about the Kickstart Scheme will take place imminently. Will my job just end after six months   Yes, it will. While some people could be taken on by the firm that Kickstarted them, this isnapost part of the scheme. Treasury officials say the scheme is aimed at helping iniduals gain confidence in the workplace, build skills needed for working, and use this as a springboard to find a long-term, sustained job. In other words, itaposs not a long-term job in itself. Firms will be asked to support people by offering training and or job search support to participants. Canapost bosses just use this to replace better-paid jobs with young people earning a pittance  In theory, no - but we donapost know how itaposll be policed. Firms must show the jobs are new, do not replace existing jobs, and are above and beyond any jobs they were expecting to create. A Treasury official said: Kickstart will give employers the chance to take on a young person who otherwise might not have got into work and support them to develop, with the costs reimbursed by government. In , we will expect those employers to give young people a high quality job, including training and or job search support, to boost their job prospects. Officials say further details on criteria and the application process will be made available in due course. According to the Financial Times, firms will be screened to ensure theyaposre not just axing better-paid staff to replace them with an army of free labour. What are the problems  The scheme is only open to under-s, so people who are older and out of work do not benefit. Itaposs also only work placements rather than full-blown, well-paid jobs, and thereaposs nothing to force firms to pay Kickstarters better or keep them on permanently. If the springboard element of the plan doesnapost work, orthere simply arenapost enough full jobs to go round at the end, thereaposs a risk itaposll keep young people occupied for six months but not help them much further along. Paul Johnson of the IFS think tank said: “There are risks of course that you will take on a  year old, and  and  year olds who you might otherwise have taken on might suffer “You might be creating jobs that are’t really jobs, pushing other people out of work. “But I think as a response to what looks like a big increase of youth unemployment this is the sort of scheme you would have expected to be put in place.” What checks will there be  Fuller guidance is promised towards the end of July or start of August to explain how the Kickstart scheme will work. Government officials said it will involve checkingfirms have discussed existing or future recruitment with unions. Officials will also look at whether there have been recent redundancies,jobs were already advertised or planned to advertise, andthe posts are dferent to previous vacancies.

Itaposs not the sort of thing a Tory from Southampton is likely to say. Nor an ex-Goldman Sachs banker. Nor an Oxbridge graduate. And probably not the son-in-law of a billionaire. Rishi Sunak is all those things, and yet said exactly that. If you think Keir Starmer is a Tory, then just imagine how the local Conservative Association chairwoman feels about the taxpayer buying Yeezys for the oiks.  It is perhaps an indication of how odd Boris Johnsonaposs government is that his Chancellor can announce such Corbynist measures to cheers from backbenchers and the Tory press. And itaposs not all due to the emergency socialism of the coronavirus crisis - after all, itaposs hard to imagine George Osborne, in the same situation, funding so much as a free slice of cake, never mind  cakes a head.But then, we live in a world where Prince Andrew apparently socialises with Denise Welch.

Because there is no better way to position yourself as the replacement for Boris Johnson, than a conspicuous display of humility. Rishi is already the most popular member of the Cabinet. He is considered by polls to be leaps and bounds ahead of the PM in his handling of the crisis, which just goes to show how little of it he handled.Rishi was not in charge of care homes when tens of thousands of residents were wilfully infected with a disease which was more likely to kill them than anyone . He was not in charge of PPE purchases or distribution. Nor was the late decision to lockdown, the continued shaking of hands, the confused and deathly public messaging, his problem.Perhaps most importantly, he has not said what Johnson did today: I take full responsibility for what has happened. But... All Rishi had to do was look competent, find the cash, and stay away from anything heaposd have to issue a non-apology for. Heaposs managed all three. Now all he has to do is wait.  He could wait for Johnson to implode, or for the inquiry, or the Russia report, or a local election wipeout. He may wait for Michael Gove to wield the blade, or to see how much of the human cost Johnson leaves on Matt Hancockaposs desk. But he probably expects enough of those things will happen inside the next  months to clear the way for a move from No Downing Street to No. There are few other contenders for the role. Jeremy Hunt, who lost out to Johnson last year, has sunk without trace. Gove is too closely linked with Johnson, and as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster was one of those giving bad advice to the PM during the crisis. Hancock, Sajid Javid and a host of other potential rivals are floundering. Rishi is the best theyaposve got. Unfortunately, much like Rishiaposs budget plans, itaposs almost certainly not going to be enough.A tiny £bn for six-month work placements on minimum wage for those aged  to  wonapost get the expected million-plus people off the dole. The minimum wage for a -year-old is just £. an hour, and a huge chunk of those facing unemployment are older, have families, or are nearing retirement. Another £bn of vouchers for green home improvements will seed jobs, but % of homes in this country have a gas-fired boiler. Insulation, or a more efficient new boiler, is an improvement, but whataposs needed is affordable, reliable hydrogen-powered boilers that generate electricity too. Theyaposre available in other countries, but in the UK thereaposs no way to get one for domestic use. Despite the government working with industry, itaposs not expected for at least a decade - £bn would speed that up considerably. But perhaps the best policy of all is £m to aposgreenapos Britainaposs below-par social housing stock with insulation, heat pumps, and double glazing. In , there were m social homes in the UK.Thataposs £ a house. Rishiaposs problem is that he is positioning himself, by spending comparitively little money, to be PM ahead of a likely second, winter wave of death, in which he would again be asked to find cash for furlough schemes, tax breaks, grants and bailouts. Heaposll need to properly fund the NHS for the first winter in a decade, compensate the pantomime industry and be held personally responsible for the tight-fistedness of Father Christmas by a generation of children.Heaposs further bedevilled by an independent Bank of England, which may vote to buy government bonds, or alter interest rates, in defiance of his wishes.And then thereaposs Keir Starmer, the most efficient , popular-in-the-polls, and purposeful Opposition leader in  years.

Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: Ministers call this the biggest defence review since the Cold War, yet it seems the MoD is a bystander. “Plans for Britainaposs future defence and security should not be in the hands of a political adviser. “We need a full assessment and wide debate about the threats the UK faces, led by military specialists.” Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: “It is utterly unprecedented that the unelected chief adviser to the Prime Minister is visiting some the UK most secret bases and establishments.  This comes only a day after a Tory MP threatens the Chief of the Defence Staff and briefings about slashing the army. “Everyone who cares about our Armed Forces should be deeply worried about all these developments. The UKaposs defence shouldnapost be the political plaything of Dominic Cummings. “Cummings can dress this up however he wants but it seems like he wanted to see Britain’s most secretive places in some boyhood playground re-enactment. It would be laughable but this man is the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser.Boris needs to bench his adviser, for all our sakes.” Writing on his blog in March , Mr Cummings previously called some aspects of defence procurement a farce. He said the procurement of aircraft carriers has continued to squander billions of pounds, enriching some of the worst corporate looters and corrupting public le via the revolving door of officials lobbyists. Scrutiny by our MPs has been contemptible.

The top Tory admitted the fight for the economy is only just starting as he gave a statement to Parliament today. Stamp Duty is slashed, everyone will get a restaurant discount in August, and homeowners will get £, vouchers to make their properties greener. Pubs, hotels and zoos will also be cheaper as VAT is slashed from % to % - though not on alcohol. And employers will get a £, bonus for not sacking people when the furlough scheme.   The Chancellor said: “I will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome. “We haven’t done everything we’ve done so far just to step back now and say ‘job done’. “In truth, the job has only just begun.” But Labouraposs Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds slammed the government for failing to extend the furlough scheme - which will end on October . Hereaposs everything you need to know from todayaposs mini-Budget. Everyone gets % off in restaurants - between Monday and Wednesday in August. And not for booze  Diners will get % off their meal at restaurants across the UK through August in a state-funded discount scheme. Eat Out to Help Out entitles every diner to a % discount, up to £ a head, at any participating restaurant, café, pub or food service establishment in the UK. The discount can be used at unlimited times, but only Monday to Wednesday, in August, and on eat-in meals including non-alcoholic drinks. You can go on multiple occasions as many times as you like - it’s just limited to £ discount per person per visit. But alcoholic drinks arenapost included. Inidual firms will register on a government website and apply to claim the money back, based on what they sell. The scheme is forecast to cost the Treasury £m. The Chancellor said it would help people find the new balance between safety and normality. The restaurants discount scheme - which can benefit , firms - is for eat-in food only and doesnapost apply to takeaways. If a sandwich shop decides to create an eat-in area i.e. put tables out, it can give the discount - but onlyyou eat in. Officials say there will be a database where people can look up participating restaurants, cafes or pubs. Guidance on the Eat Out scheme will be published on July  and the portal is due to open for firms to participate on the same day. That guidance will address whether it can be used in conjunction with other offers. Britainaposs ailing hospitality industry will be given a £.bn boost by slashing VAT from % to % on food, accommodation and attractions. The cut will come into force from July  and last until January  - making a trip to the pub or a family day out cheaper. It will apply to supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafés and similar premises across the UK. It will also apply to supplies of accommodation and admission to attractions across the UK. Further guidance is due shortly. Stamp Duty for homebuyers is being slashed - immediately  Right now there is no Stamp Duty on house purchases below £,. Today, effective immediately, the government is increasing the threshold to £,. The £.bn policy will be a temporary cut running until March  next year. The Chancellor claimed the average bill for people buying a home will fall by £,. And nearly nine of  people buying a main home this year will pay no Stamp Duty at all, he said. Unlike other measures it will benefit wealthier people - as cheaper homes had only a small Stamp Duty bill anyway. But Mr Sunak said: House prices have fallen for the first time in eight years and uncertainty abounds in the market - a market we need to be thriving. Officials said they were moved to act after Savills predicted the market would only get back to February levels by autumn . The Stamp Duty cut will take effect from midnight tonight and last until March . The rates of tax once you’re above £, stand as they were before. In other words, Stamp Duty will be charged at % on every pound from £, to £,, and %, then %, on higher amounts over that threshold. So a £, house will cost £, rather than £, in Stamp Duty. A Treasury spokesman said it was “absolutely % not the case” that the cut was brought forward because plans to do it in the autumn leaked out. The Chancellor announced a new “jobs retention bonus” in a bid to get people back off furlough and into their job. But there won’t be a cash bonus for the people on furlough themselves. Instead their employers will get a £, bonusthey bring someone back off furlough - and employ them continuously until January. To qualy, employees must be paid at least £ a month on average in each month from November to January - the equivalent of the lower earnings limit in National Insurance. If every furloughed job takes advantage of the scheme it will pay out £bn. Mr Sunak said: “Our message to business is clear -you stand by your workers, we will stand by you.” The £, bonus applies to anyone who’s previously been furloughed. More detail is expected by the end of July but full guidance is only due in the Autumn. Government officials insisted it would disproportionately help lower-paid workers keep their jobs, because £, is bigger compared to the cost of keeping them on. But it is thought thereaposs nothing legally to stop firms claiming the bonus, then making people redundant on February . But furlough is still being scrapped in October  The Chancellor stood by his decision to scrap the furlough scheme - which has subsidised more than million jobs - on October . He said “I know when furlough ends it will be a dficult moment but the scheme “cannot and should not go on forever” He said “calling for endless extensions to furlough it just as irresponsible” as ending it immediately would’ve been in June. And it“gives people  hope that it will always be possible toto the jobs they had before”, he said. If people spend longer on furlough, he said, “skills will fade” and they will “find it harder” to get new opportunities. Hundreds of thousands of young people will get six-month job placements  The package includes £billion to subsidise thousands of six-month work placements for people facing long-term unemployment.Under the “kick-start” scheme,  to -year-olds on Universal Credit will be eligible for six-month placements with the state covering % of the minimum wage for  hours a week. Bosses, who can top up wages, get a £, admin fee plus the other costs of employing someone like National Insurance. The Resolution Foundation said the scheme could help up to , young into work – but must be delivered quickly. Paul Johnson of the IFS think tank said: “There are risks of course that you will take on a  year old, and  and  year olds who you might otherwise have taken on might suffer “You might be creating jobs that are’t really jobs, pushing other people out of work. Fuller guidance is promised towards the end of July or start of August to explain how the Kickstart scheme will work. Government officials said Kickstart jobs must be genuinely new, not just replacing better-paid staff. Checks will involve checkingfirms have discussed existing or future recruitment with unions. Officials will also look at whether there have been recent redundancies,jobs were already advertised or planned to advertise, andthe posts are dferent to previous vacancies. The Chancellor pledged an extra £billion to the Department for Work and Pensionsas it doubles the number of work coaches for Universal Credit. The benefit system has been inundated with more than million claims since the start of the pandemic. The money breaks down as:£m to double the number of work coaches in Jobcentres across Britain by March  £m to expand the Work and Health Programme with additional voluntary support this autumn for those unemployed for more than three months £m to the private sector to launch a job finding support service in autumn - with one-to-one help for those unemployed for less than three months £m for the Flexible Support Fund to help claimants by removing barriers to work, such as travel expenses for attending interviews.A bonus for companies who employ trainees "},{"url":null,"title":"tory ex minister liam fox","story":"NewsTory ex-Minister Liam Fox lined up for World Trade Organisation jobThe former International Trade Secretary and former Defence Secretary is up for a new jobShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUL News \", url\"What is really going on in politics  Get our daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The country stands on the brink of a devastating recession that would bring with it unemployment, poverty and despair. If we are to avoid that fate, the Chancellor must come up with an ambitious rescue package that works for the whole country. The promise of support to help young people find work is a welcome step. So too is the extra investment in the green economy. But there is an urgent need for action for those who stand to lose their jobs as the furlough scheme is wound down. Many of these jobs could be savedthe Chancellor kept the Job Retention Scheme for the sectors worst affected by Covid-, such as aviation, retail and hospitality. He should also use this opportunity to raise wages for our heroic key workers. And there must be more to help our high streets as they emerge from the lockdown. The Government was too slow to respond to the medical crisis. It must not make the same mistake with the economic emergency. If Mr Sunak fails to rise to the challenge, the price will be another generation blighted by unemployment and deprivation. Ban fur cruelty  There are not many industries more abhorrent than the fur trade. Fur farming has been banned in the UK since  but almost £million worth of pelts are still imported each year. Now we have left the EU, the Government can easily ban these imports. Our demand for action has the support of animal rights campaigners, opposition parties and celebrities. There is no place for fur in British shops.

Anxiety-ridden teenager Ellis Battersby had been missing for more than  hours when his body was found by school friend Fiona Passingham and her mum near their home, the coroner heard. The -year-old had struggled to cope after moving from the Great Marlow school to a college in Henley-on-Thames and as his exams drew closer he disappeared following a regular day in class. In a statement, Fiona said: I often gave Ellis a lt to school. On February  I had been out with my family celebrating my mumaposs birthday when Tommessaged me askingI had seen Ellis. I said I had not because I did not go to college on Wednesdays. At .am, police knocked on my door and told me they had found a suicide note which had my name in it. I was so worried about Ellis that at .am we went out to search for him in his favourite spots. It was cold and snowing, I expected to see him huddled in the corner shivering. We saw Ellis from afar and it looked like he was standing. The coroner heard that in , Dr Samantha Watts - a GP from Marlow Medical Group - confirmed that Ellis was diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and anxiety. In his last appointment in September , Ellis had explained he was increasingly anxious following his move to Henley College but was still meeting his friends on Fridays and speaking to them online. Dr Watts said: Ellis was a young man whose autistic spectrum disorder and with anxiety was exacerbated by school and exams, despite support. His state much improved at the end of exams in .  During the Buckinghamshire inquest, coroner Crispin Butler heard from Henley College counsellor Emma Holmes who had supported the schoolboy since the move. Ellis had a safe space to go to when he found lessons dficult. He had support from a teaching assistant and to one-to-one sessions with me. We did not have concerns for his safety. However, Ellis did not feel he would be able to get a job, learn to drive or be independent. The coroner explained to Ellisapos father and uncle sat in the inquest in Beaconsfield his decision that the boy, from Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire, had taken his own le. There was not a clear picture in terms of what was going to happen and sadly it ended in absolute tragedy. I think he decided to do it without anyone wanting to know it was going to happen.

Steven Platt says ordinary soldiers see their pay skyrocket when they join private outfits, turning many into aposweekend millionairesapos. The -year-old, from Barry, Wales, joined the British Army at  and served in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, before becoming a aposgun for hireapos. The former Welsh Guardsman, dubbed the aposbaby assassinapos by his old Army pals due to his youthful appearance, now runs a private military company . He decided to join a PMC after seeing how mercenaries in Iraq were better equipped than British troops. Steven told MirrorOnline: I finished my six months thereand flew back with a PMC. I was getting maybe £, a month in the Army, with the company I made £, a month. Initially the motivation was money. Any mercenary who tells you heaposs got a moral obligation is full of s***. You have a job, there is no right and wrong. You travel across the world and get the best of everything. You basically live like a rockstar. But it comes with huge risks. Despite the incredible pay, Steven saw his colleagues aposlosing arms and fingersapos in improvised explosive deviceblasts and complained about the poor kit he was provided with. He said he used aposhideousapos weapons and drove Ford pick-up trucks with only clip-on armour for protection while carrying out security convoys.  Steven explained: We were hit with IEDs and drive-by shootings. In the Army I hardly discharged my weapon. As a mercenary I discharged it constantly. After surviving a few aposnasty incidentsapos with the Iraqi police and Shia militias, Steven joined a new firm called Erinys in , which he had encountered while serving in Iraq.  During this time he was paid an £,-a-month wage to escort US diplomats. He said: The camaraderie was great. We had BBQs at night and beers. My team was mainly South Africans, as a Welshman we had a bond over rugby. The mercenary saved money to provide for his newborn son, although he admitted many of his colleagues indulged in lavish lestyles. He said these contractors were nicknamed aposweekend millionairesapos, known for spending all of their money during breaks from work.  Steven added: The industry had loads of aposweekend millionairesapos. Lads who would spend their wages within the first few days of leave and then struggle to pay rent or eat. These were predominantly “younger” guys who had families or commintments. Over a period of two to three days, they would blow all their cash on anything and everything, ranging from expensive cars, nights on the p**s, women, you name it. Lads would waste all their money then end up cutting their leave short toto Iraq. We were doing three months in the country and then a month off and I could never understand how they could get through so much money in such a short space of time. Steven claims that while people in his industry are primarily motivated by money, there are still aposgoodapos and aposbadapos mercenaries.  He added: We are just normal people, we do work for money but we are not all bad. There’s the aposgood guysapos who work with ious governments, agencies and organisations. They help maintain and support national security of many nations. Then we have the aposbad guysapos who provide ious services to drug cartels and work with organised crime syndicates. The drugs trade in Myanmar and Latin America has been flooded by PMCs.  Although Steven was initially motivated by money, he believes PMCs are crucial for maintaining peace.  After years as a contractor on land, Steven started working as a freelancer on ships, defending them from Somali pirates.

Michael Lofthouse was filmed verbally abusing Jordan Chan and her family at a restaurant in Carmel Valley, Calornia, US. The footage, in which Lofthouse calls the family f***ing Asian piece of s**t, has gone viral with almost two million views. The Newcastle Business School graduate can be heard berating the family as they celebrate a birthday, before being ordered to leave by a waitress. Lofthouse has now expressed remorse about his aposappalling behaviourapos, claiming he aposlost controlapos in the moment. He said: My behaviour in the video is appalling. This was clearly a moment where I lost control and made incredibly hurtful and isive comments. I would like to deeply apologise to the Chan family. I can only imagine the stress and pain they feel. I was taught to respect people of all races, and I will take the time to reflect on my actions and work to better understand the inequality that so many of those around me face every day.His outburst came as racial isions burn in the US remain high following the death of George Floyd and the coronavirus pandemic.  But Lofthouse continues. You f***ing Asian piece of s**t, he shouts before turning to the waitress and saying: Who are these f***ers  She snaps but: They are valued guests. Lofthouse, himself an immigrant in the States, replies: Are they  They are valued guests in America  Chan later wrote on Instagram, the white supremacist Brit had begun harassing her family soon after they sang happy birthday to her aunt.Aside from the racist comments caught on camera, she said he also told them to go back to whatever fucking Asian country youaposre from and that you donapost belong here. She added on the post that he had a LOT more to say after I stopped recording. Lofthouse is the CEO and founder of Silicon Valley tech company Solid. He moved to the US in  having, he says, formerly worked for Hewlett-Packard and IBM in the UK.

Stacey Matthews, , mistook her cancer for a bad back caused by her mattress - and brushed off her worries. The Blackpool mum eventually plucked up the courage to go to hospital, where an MRI scan revealed the cancer had spread to her left lung, liver, groin and spine. Further investigations also revealed Stacey had a lump in her left breast. Stacey started chemotherapy immediately in a bid to prolong her le, but after two rounds she was given the devastating news it was too late for the treatment to work and she has just weeks to live. Heartbroken at the thought of not making it to December, Stacey told family members she wanted just one last Christmas with her children Caitlan, , Byron, , Chardanai, , and Lilly, six. Local charity The Albert Project, founded by Wayne Sanderson, heard about Staceyaposs last wish and got to work immediately. They sourced donations of presents, Christmas decorations, a turkey, pigs in blankets, Christmas crackers and games from Morrisons supermarket. Other locals and businesses rallied around to give Staceyaposs last Christmas one to remember - decorating the house with lights, tinsel, and Christmas trees.  Staceyaposs four children had no idea about the plans until they arrived home to find the house transformed into a Christmas grotto and presents piled up in the living room. Full-time mum Stacey said: When the consultant told me the chemotherapy wasnapost working and I didnapost have long left, the first thing I thought about was Christmas. Christmas is a big deal in our house, having four children means itaposs always a day filled with so much happiness, and I knew I just wanted one more Christmas Day with the kids - evenitaposs in the middle of summer. My family appealed to the Albert Project and within a matter of days we were sent presents, decorations, cakes and sweets. It was just overwhelming. Iaposve been honest with the children about my diagnosis. They know I havenapost got long left and we have had some sad days, but weaposre trying to make every day a happy day from now on. I want them to have happy memories of our last few weeks together.  Seeing the kidsapos faces when they came home and found Christmas Day in the middle of summer is something I will never forget. The look on their faces was amazing, but it was very emotional at times too. At one point Lilly asked why we were having Christmas Day, and I had to tell her it was because mummy didnapost have long left and I might not be here at Christmas. It was so hard having to tell her again and the realisation hitting me. We cried a lot. Despite suffering from back pain for weeks, Stacey never thought it was anything serious and was reluctant to visit the hospital due to the virus epidemic.Stacey said: I had back pain for weeks, but I was worried about going to hospital because of coronavirus.I didnapost think it was anything serious at first, I just put it down to my bed or my mattress. I thought I might be sleeping funny, or I thought it might be something to do with my periods, but it turned out the cancer had basically crushed my spine. Iaposd also been sick quite a lot, I couldnapost keep anything down and I lost about a stone in weight, but I didnapost put two and two together. I thought I just had a stomach bug. The thought of cancer didnapost cross my mind.  By the time I went to hospital I was in agony. The consultant told me the cancer had spread and my spinal wall had collapsed, and I was given strong pain medication straightaway, and soon after I started chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but it was too late. Wayne Sanderson, from The Albert Project, said: As soon as we heard about Stacey and her family we wanted to do everything we could to help them. Under normal circumstances we are a homeless charity, but during the coronavirus crisis we have adapted to help anyone in need, and weaposve built up some amazing contacts in the local area, so we knew we could give Stacey and her family the Christmas Day they deserve in such heartbreaking circumstances.

Robert Jobson hit out at the duke, saying itaposs very easy to criticise the royal familyaposs position when heaposs living in a huge mansion in LA, highlighting the good work the Commonwealth has done over the years.He also added that Meghan Markle doesnapost understand the Commonwealth.The couple spoke about the historical issues when they joined young leaders from the Queenaposs Commonwealth Trust to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement.He said there is no turning back now, adding that we must acknowledge the past even though itaposs uncomfortable.He said: When you look across the Commonwealth, there is no way that we can move forward unless we acknowledge the past. So many people have done such an incredible job of acknowledging the past and trying to right those wrongs, but I think we all acknowledge there is so much more still to do. Speaking to talkRadio, Jobson said: I think that to criticise the Queenaposs le work is disrespectful.  I think that things have changed since the Queen inherited this role as head of the Commonwealth. At that time, it was only a handful of countries who had joined the Commonwealth.

The detective who spearheaded the biggest manhunt in UK criminal history had just come face to face with the traffic officer in hospital shortly after the shootings. In more than  years of service, Neil, now , had worked on many murder inquiries. But nothing prepared him for the sight of PC Rathband in hospital, his face swollen, peppered with gunshot wounds suffered at point-blank range in his patrol car. Moat was still on the loose and had just threatened police, saying: “I’ve just downed one of your officers. I’m not going to stop.” Neil, head of Northumbria Police CID, found himself at the centre of the most ­challenging investigation of his le, recalling: “It was like being hit with a tsunami.” But he knew David, and it is the memory of those devastating injuries – and his colleague’s bravery – which stays with him. “I went with the Chief Constable to visit David in hospital,” he said in an interview to mark the th anniversary of the manhunt. “He was in a terrible state. Sitting up in a chair at the side of his bed, his face was severely swollen and peppered with gunshot. “He was rational, sensible, brave. He asked us to catch Raoul Moat. It was a tearful, moving experience, one I shall never forget.” Neil led daily press conferences giving the latest on the search in the early days of -hour news, facing probing questions live in front of millions of viewers. Neil and I have known each since our school days. We were born and brought up in Beacon Lough, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. In later years, we went on holidays together with friends. So it was bizarre to be in the packed press conferences with Neil, a detective chief superintendent, watching him face the world’s media, and asking him questions in briefings.His experiences feature in ITV’s Manhunt: The Raoul Moat Story. Memories of the most stressful eight days of his le came flooding back during filming. It all began in the early hours of July , , with the cold-blooded murder of Chris Brown, . The karate instructor was seeing Moat’s former girlfriend Sam Stobbart, , who he also shot and wounded.  Moat, , had just been freed from prison for assaulting a child and Sam had ended their relationship – saying she was going out with a police officer in an effort to get Moat out of her le. But he was intent on bloody revenge and made for her home, sitting beneath a window, listening to her talking to Chris. “Moat was there for more than an hour,” recalls Neil. “He was texting his accomplice Karl Ness parked up nearby. Knowing Moat as she did, Sam expected a fight. “Chris actually came out of the house with a metal bar in his hand, not for one moment expecting Moat to be right outside. It was a cowardly attack, Moat shooting him twice in the back as he walked out of the house. “He shot him a third time from close range in the back of the head after he fell.” Moat had added small weights to the shotgun cartridges to cause maximum injury.After the murder of Chris, described by Neil as the tragedy’s “forgotten victim”, Moat calmly walked up to the window where Sam was phoning police, shot her in the stomach, then ran. Ness was parked nearby but, on hearing the shots, drove off, leaving Moat.  Moat later met up with Ness and another accomplice Qhuram Awan. All three travelled around the area in Awan’s black Lexus. Chris, who was not a police officer, had been caught up in Moat’s insane jealousy. Before shooting PC Rathband, Moat used a pay-as-you-go phone to call the police and say that he was “hunting for officers now”. “He parked on a slip road out of sight of PC Rathband,” said Neil. “He sneaked up and shot David twice in the face, jumped back in the Lexus and took off into Northumberland, leaving David in agony, saying ‘I’ve been shot’ as he cried out for help on the radio. A short while later Moat again called the police callously boasting of his actions.” An unprecedented police operation followed, as Moat had the “means, capability and obvious intention” of killing officers. Neil had the task of finding him. “At that stage, the threat was against police, not the public” he said. Firearms officers from across the UK were called, with experts, psychologists and even TV survival expert Ray Mears. When Awan and Ness were caught on Tuesday July , Moat ran off near Rothbury, Northumberland – a county with nearly , sq miles of wilderness.  “The operation’s scale was huge,” Neil recalled. “Then Home Secretary Theresa May wanted updates. People underestimated the vast search area. I’m sure some thought ‘he is only hiding in some bushes, why can’t they find him ’ Moat made signicant efforts to hide.“Psychological advice was important. We had to be ready to confront him and were thinking ahead, deploying negotiators. Their advice was that unless he was specially trained in living without resources in the wild, the strain would play on him and he would come out. That is exactly what happened. He lasted until the Friday.” At one stage, two bounty hunters from Sunderland were arrested. An armed operation was also carried out after helicopters picked up infrared of a body in a field. It was a sleeping drunk.  “We had  alleged sightings that week,” said Neil, a dad-of-two now retired after  years’ service. “There were reports from people who believed they had walked past Moat in Rothbury. Whether that’s true I don’t know – what we know now is we were right to stick with that search area.” I spoke with Neil at the end of those long days to offer support. “It was really hard,” he says. “I had my we worried about me being on telly with a gunman on the loose. She said ‘whathe comes after you ’ We had reports claiming he was seen in Newcastle, Berwick and even Spain. “Some people told us their sheds had been broken into and ‘they were sure it was Moat’. The pressures of the day-to-day press conference built so much. The public and media started to doubtMoat was in Rothbury, as our searching was proving fruitless. We had to hold our nerve.” Two factors underpinned the operation, which involved hundreds of officers, army personnel and search experts. There were no confirmed sightings of Moat and covert intelligence suggested he had not left the area after Awan and Ness – later jailed for a minimum of  years and  years respectively – were arrested in a swoop by armed officers. “Pressure from the media really built up,” said Neil. “But despite wanting to, I could not explain our covert intelligence.” It ended with a call on the evening of July . A colleague said: ‘‘‘Boss, we’ve got him’. My first question was, ‘is it definitely him ’” said Neil. “They replied, ‘yes – he’s in a standoff with armed officers’. My second was, ‘where is he ’ My relief was huge when they said ‘Rothbury’.” A resident – who later got a £, reward – calmly called to say: “The man you are looking for is at the bottom of the road.” Armed police moved in. “The people of Rothbury were incredibly supportive,” added Neil. Memorably, footballer Paul Gascoigne turned up with a cooked chicken and fishing rod, to try and persuade Moat to hand himself in – but was asked to leave by officers. A Taser was used to try and avert Moat’s suicide and its inventor, Peter Boatman, later took his le after it emerged the firm supplied them to police while they were still being tested.

Shocked Sharon Baggaley went straight to her doctor who referred her to hospital where she underwent surgery to remove the mole that turned out to be a malignant melanoma. The -year-old gym manager- who used to go on sunbeds three times a week from the age of  to her mid s- said she was devastated that the mole on her torso below her right breast was skin cancer.She said: I have a lot of moles but didnapost think anything about them until I spotted a picture on my Facebook Memories of a holiday weaposd had in Egypt.I could see a mole I have on my body below my breast as I was wearing a bikini - and I realised it was now four times bigger and looked dferent. The mole was darker and had jagged edges, too. When I looked closer it also had a crusty appearance so I knew I had to do something about it. I hate going to the doctors and wouldnapost have goneI hadnapost seen that Facebook post. But, luckily, I did as I had stage one malignant melanoma andIaposd left it much longer it would have developed into stage two or three and eventually spread to my lymph nodes. Sharon needed further surgery to make sure all of the cancer was removed and didnapost spread to her lymph nodes. She now needs constant check-ups but is so scared of the cancer ing sheaposs put her plans to have children on hold. Sharon, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, first became hooked on sunbeds at  when she started working at a gym and was given free sessions as a staff perk.  Sheaposd have three six-minute sessions per week laying naked on the sunbed that tanned from the top and below, with a pull-over hood. I wanted a tan so Iaposd look good when I went out at weekends. Iaposm pale with blonde hair and blue eyes and it takes ages for me to get any colour, she said. Iaposd go on sunbeds three times a week and sunbathe without wearing sun cream as I wanted to be golden brown. I didnapost want tan lines so would just wear aposwinkiesapos - special stickers to go over my eyes - and then my friend told me about a special cream that you used to make you even browner using a sunbed. My skin was bright red afterwards, so I didnapost go on the sunbed again until it calmed down. But I was soon using them again as I hated being pale. Iaposd sunbathe outside every chance I got but would never put on any sun creammy mum wasnapost around. Sheaposd nag me to use it but I thought it stopped me getting any colour so I avoided using it whenever I could.  Sharon then started using a stand-up tanning machine twice a week to top up her tan and didnapost stop using it until her mid s. Thataposs when I discovered fake tan, she says. I stopped using sunbeds then but unbeknown to me the damage had already been done. Sharon, who has several moles, had noticed one under her right breast would itch sometimes, but dismissed it as nothing. I couldnapost really see it because of where it was so didnapost think about it, she says. In  she and husband Craig, , a driver, went on holiday to Egypt. I posted up a picture of me in a red bikini on Facebook to show everyone how hot it was and how my tan was coming along, she says.  I didnapost look at it again but it came up on my Memories last February on Facebook and straight away I spotted the mole and realised how much bigger it was now. I looked at it in the mirror and asked Craig to check too and we could see it was four times bigger, darker and had a crusty appearance. I then remembered it had bled a couple of times since the holiday but Iaposd thought I must have caught it getting changed. Worried, Sharon went straight to see her GP, who referred her to a dermatologist who arranged an appointment at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital. The specialist there wanted to remove it and less than four weeks after seeing the Memories post on Facebook, Sharon had the mole removed under local anaesthetic. I was sore after the op, which was done under local anaesthetic, but I still wasnapost worried,apos Sharon says. aposBut the hospital contacted me and said that it was skin cancer and I broke down. I thought I was going to die. But the nurse calmed me down saying I needed more surgery to take more of the skin around it away. They wanted to make sure they had got all of it.  That operation really hurt even though they injected me. The surgeon had to go down about two centimetres and I screamed in agony. They had to inject me again to make it totally numb. Afterwards I was told I didnapost need chemo because theyaposd got every trace of it and it had been stage one malignant melanoma, caused by a combination of using sunbeds and not putting on sun cream when I sunbathed. I told my surgeon Iaposd discovered the changes in my mole and wouldnapost have come init wasnapost for that Facebook post and he said I was very lucky. It could have spread to my lymph nodes and could have eventually killed me. I am just so grateful for that Memories post on Facebook. But Sharon, who had planned to start trying for children with Craig now says sheaposs too worried to have a baby. I need constant check-ups, she says, and Iaposve even had a lump come up on my left arm which Iaposm terried is cancer.

Under the Home Office plans Darrell and Darren Roberts will be forced to leave the UK and live in two dferent countries that they have never visited and where they have no friends or close relatives. Darrell, , has been issued with a deportation notice informing him that he will be sent to the Dominican Republic. He is said to believe officials mistakenly confused the country with Dominica, another Caribbean island, where his dad was born, thereports. Meanwhile the partner of his twin Darren has said he has been warned he faces deportation to Grenada, where his mother was born. The brothers lived with their mum until she died from cancer and then they were looked after by their uncle whose le was also claimed by the disease when they were . Their dad, who had no contact with them, had moved abroad before their mum died and neither parents had British citizenship. The tragedy resulted in them being taken into care by Ealing Council in west London, which the twinaposs sibling said was negligent for failing to organise citizenship when they were children. The brothersapos teenage years are said to have been unhappy and disrupted as they were shunted between a series of unsuccessful foster placements with Darrell being convicted of grievous bodily harmwhile he was still in the care system. Both brothers, who were born in London, are currently serving jail sentences for GBH. Darrellaposs lawyer is claimed to have said he was vulnerable due to his young age on conviction and his traumatic childhood. He was jailed for six years and towards the end of his sentence he was served with a deportation notice. The Home Office automatically issues a deportation notice to anyone without British citizenship who has been convicted of a reasonably serious offence and jailed for more than  months. If someone is born in the UK and has been granted British citizenship there is a good character requirement which could result in a deportation notice servedthey serve a long prison term. Darrellaposs deportation notice states: “Our records show you have no legal status in the United Kingdom. The home secretary has deemed deportation to be conducive to the public good and accordingly it is in the public interest that you be removed from the United Kingdom without delay.  Darrell said he was shocked to learn he was being deported and despite explaining to officials he was born, bred and educated in the UK he was met with an unsympathetic response. He said prison staff laughed at him when he said he was born in the UK and seemed not to believe him. He said from his prison cell: “It is mentally draining the stress is unnecessary. I’ve got grey hairs and I’m only  years old.” Darrell said he has been offered a grant to allow him to “ home” under the facilitatedscheme which includes a package worth £,he agrees to the deportation. Darren’s partner, who asked not to be named, said he had spoken to her twice about being faced with deportation since revealing the news six months ago. Darren said prison staff warned him he would be sent to Grenada where he finishes his jail sentence. The couple have a five-year-old son, who was also born in London. She said: “He said it didn’t make sense, and asked me to make arrangements to bring our son to visit him. He was shocked. Prisoners can appeal against deportation orders but there are limited grounds for appeal for those sentenced to more than four years.  The twins’ younger sister, Freya Valie Roberts, a student at Bristol university, said her brothers were neglected by Ealing Council as they failed to nationalise them. She added: “Darrell and Darren’s plight highlights the systemic racism built into our institutions in Britain. Children born in the UK are eligible for citizenship but they must lodged an application that has a fee. Celia Clarke is the director of Bail for Immigration Detainees, an organisation that provides legal advice and representation to people held in immigration detention in the UK and to long-term residents facing deportation. She toldthat the governmentaposs automatic deportation regime was callous and cruel and it needs to be ended. She added: “The suffering and trauma that Darrell and Darren have gone through is unimaginable to most of us, not least the most recent trauma of receiving a deportation notice from the Home Office. For most of us, being born in this country means that this is our home for the rest of our lives, and we expect to be offered its protection.

The text “Happy th of July” appears at the bottom of the -second video.

Letourneau - who died from cancer on Monday reportedly with her victim at her bedside - was teaching second grade at Shorewood Elementary School in Seattle when she began a sexual relationship with her student Vili Fualaa in . He was just  or  years old and she was  at the time, married and with four children. They were discovered by police together in a car in the early hours of June ,  but they both gave  names and Letourneau told officers Fualaa was . Letourneau later changed her story, saying she had been babysitting the boy but took him out after she and her husband had a fight. They got away with it and Fualaaaposs mother told police not to take any further action. However the boyaposs mum later said thatpolice had told her Letourneau had lied about his age and what had happened in the car, she would not have allowed her son to go back to the teacher. In March of the following year the teacher was arrested when a relative of her husband contacted police. Letourneau pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape and her first child with Fualaa was born in May  as she awaited sentencing. The disgraced teacher was able to negotiate a plea agreement where she would serve six months, three suspended, in county jail. But the agreement stipulated she could not contact Fualaa, her four children with her first husband or her most recent baby she had conceived with Fualaa. Just two weeks after completing her jail sentence, in February , Letourneau was again found by police in car with Fualaa. Once again she tried to lie her way out of trouble with police who found evidence the two had met several times since her release, ,   in cash, baby clothes and her passport inside the car. Her prior plea agreement was revoked and replaced with a sentence of seven and a half years. In October , while serving her second stint in jail, Letourneau gave birth to her second daughter by Fualaau. That year the aposcoupleapos - Fualaau was still just  - co-authored a book published in France called Only One Crime, Love. While imprisoned for child rape in May , she orced her husband, and he gained custody of their four children. Letourneau served six months in solitary when letters she tried to send to Fualaau were intercepted. In  a television film was released in America called: All-American Girl: The Mary Kay Letourneau Story. She was released in August  and Fualaau, then , persuaded the court to reverse the no-contact order against her.They married in May the following year with aposexclusive accessapos sold to television show Entertainment Tonight. In an interview Letourneau claimed she did not know having sex with Fualaau was a crime and that they had deliberately waited until the end of the school year. She said: If someone had told me,anyone had told me, there is a specic law that says this is a crime I did not know.Iaposve said this over and over again. Had Iaposd known,anyone knows my personality. Just the idea, this would count as a crime. Fualaau filed for orce in May  it was later withdrawn but the orce was finalised in August .  During their relationship Fualaau had insisted their relationship was not abusive.However since their separation a source is reported to have told People : Heaposs starting to get some perspective.He sees things clearly now, and realizes that this wasnapost a healthy relationship from the start. After the split, he started really going over things in his mind, the insider told People. Just thinking about how they met, and how that affected how they interacted as adults. He was never really a full-fledged partner he was always secondary. He sees that now. Letourneau died earlier this week after several months battling colon cancer.

Images of Edouard from space show it gathering pace and growing as it northeasrward. According to the National Hurricane Centre, the cyclone is forecast to continue moving rapidly before it is expected to be absorbed into a larger front over the North Atlantic today. NASA said the cyclone was officially born on July  and is the fth tropical storm of the Atlantic Ocean this hurricane season. National Hurricane Center forecaster Jack Beven noted, “The cyclone is located in a region of strong southwesterly vertical wind shear, is heading for colder water, and is approaching a frontal system.  This combination should lead to extratropical transition between  to  hours, and it is possible that Edouard could strengthen a little as transition occurs.  After transition, the extratropical low should persist for another  hours or so before the circulation dissipates.” While Edouard will considerably be less powerful by the time it hits Britain, forecasters are warning of plenty of unsettled weather to come.Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said the worst of the weather will be seen in Wales before the weekend with mm plus in some of the more exposed spots.Temperatures once again held back because of the cloud and outbreaks of rain, he continued. National Resources Wales has placed two flood alerts in place, as a result. BBC meteorologist Tomascz Schafernaker agreed Britain is going to be left particularly soggy with outbreaks of rain to hang around for  hours or so. However, he said the weekendaposs looking pretty good with lots of warm sunshine on the way - and some forecasters predict the UK could see seven days of heat next week.

The bizarre alien-like blob was found on Urangan Beach in Hervey Bay, in southern Queensland, on Friday. The intrigued passer by posted a picture of a mysterious, sand-covered lump to Facebook and askedit was a dangerous stonefish. However, many of the respondents said they believed it to be ambergris, a rare and valuable ingredient used in the manufacture of perfume. Ambergris, which is a hard amber-like substance, is highly-prized by perfume companies and worth up to £ per gram. In , a family in South Australia made over mafter they encounter a haul of ambergris that had washed ashore. And in , unemployed Ken Wilman said his boxer dog Madge found a lb lump, which was worth an estimated £,, in Morecambe, Lancashire. Ambergris is produced in the intestines of sperm whales as aposslurryapos before it hardens in the water as it is ejected. The woman was told by Facebook users to scoop up the object and sell it on eBay - with one person telling her it was worth a lot. But a university professor told her ambergis was more wax-like in its appearance and told her not to get her hopes up.  Professor Sandie Degnan, of the University of Queensland, told Yahoo News Australia she was unsure what it that was - but her best guess was that creature to be sea pork, which gets its name as it resembles slabs of pig fat “I do think it’s likely that this is a form of the animal that is commonly referred to as sea pork,” Professor Degnan said. “It is a kind of sea squirt, related to the cunjevois that many people are familiar with growing on our rocky shores .

Rational politics is now tribal, civil dialogue is now bitter and our citizens need only minor provocation before becoming unhinged.Scottish independence, Brexit Britain, Trump’s America and Covid- all show us how quickly change can arrive.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We’d been taking bookings on the phone during lockdown but at % of normal levels.“On the first day open we were exceptionally busy. We had four desks operating at the branch and had to call on extra help to cope with the numbers coming in.“In that first week we took as much bookings as the Thomas Cook branch did in the whole of July last year.”By far the favourite destination for Dundee holidaymakers was Spain, he revealed, followed by the Canary Islands and Turkey.With air travel rules yet to be finalised in Scotland, customers were prepared to fly from Newcastle and Manchester airports to guarantee a holiday abroad.England has lted quarantine restrictions for holidaymakers travelling to a list of  ‘air bridged’ countries, but Nicola Sturgeon branded the plan ‘shambolic’.Scottish airport bosses this week called for clarity “as soon as possible” to prevent further job losses and allow routes to be re-established.John commented: “We’re just awaiting an announcement from Nicola Sturgeon which we expect will bring another upturn in demand.#He added: “I’ve been in the travel industry for  years and been through the twin towers, wars in the Middle East – so many global events – but one thing is for certain, the tourism industry is resilient.”While most travel agent branches are now open for business in Dundee, Barrhead Travel – which announced redundancies this week – is currently closed.A spokeswoman for the Glasgow-based firm told the Tele the Dundee branch is expected to open again in the next fortnight.She added: “Our commitment to supporting our customers is not affected by this announcement – we have teams still working remotely and we’re contacting all customers who have bookings affected by Covid- disruptions.“We can assure all of our customers that their holidays remain fully financially protected.”The firm – which employs  staff in  branches throughout Scotland – said the dficult decision to make staff redundant came as a direct result of the impact of Covid-.Jacqueline Dobson, president of Barrhead Travel, said: “Customer confidence has been dented by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding quarantine and travel restrictions.#This, combined with the imminent closure of the furlough scheme, means we have had to announce a number of redundancies.“We will be ensuring that there is full support available for all our colleagues – personally and professionally – over the coming months.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Every day this goes on jobs are lost or put at risk.#In the industry we have been looking for a safe way to allow people to come into the country and leave the country and the air bridges concept we came together on.#We are quite amazed that all four nations weren#t party to this.#The decision on July  is subject to a -day review, and there#s some key destinations that we#d want to see on there, including Canada, Tunisia and Portugal.#With kids going back to school in August, we#ll have lost our summer season, around % to % of annual journeys are in the summer months.#Wehaven#t even been implementing the quarantine process. It leads me to ask the question why have we not been running this entire time  There#s a high amount of people filling out the form because they have to or they#ll get fined, but they aren#t checking up on people isolating when they#re in the country because they didn#t have the clearance to do so.#The list of countries holidaymakers leaving from English airports can travel to without the need for a UK quarantine includes popular destinations such as Spain, France, Italy, Turkey, and Greece.Long haul destinations, including Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam are also on the list.Speaking at her daily briefing conference yesterday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I understand the impatience here but we must take these decisions properly.“If people want a first minister that is just going to be a rubber stamp for decisions taken where at any point – but particularly where she has a concern that those decisions may not be absolutely the right ones given the circumstances we face in Scotland – then that is not me.“We need to do that careful analysis, we need to weigh up the risks and benefits ourselves, and we need to come to a considered view overall.”Ms Sturgeon added she hopes such arrangements will still be possible for Scots looking to travel to low-risk countries, although added that more analysis was needed.She admitted she would have liked Covid- quarantine checks on people ing to Scotland to have started earlier.And she confirmed that checks were to begin today following the weekend revelation that none had been carried out despite the quarantine requirement being in force for four weeks.She added: “In an ideal world, of course I would like everything that we are doing to tackle this crisis to start earlier than, often, for practical reasons, is possible.”Mr Provan added that one of the most dficult aspects so far was having staff members approach him asking about their job security, when he was unable to give any answers.He said: #We#re working on % of our revenues, but still maintaining % of our costs.#Airlines are moveable assets, they can pick up their assets and move them into countries that don#t have quarantine,this continues they could move from Scotland to somewhere  that isn#t implementing a quarantine andthat happens they won#t be coming back.#My staff are coming to me every day asking when will we be coming back off furlough  At this point I don#t know what to tell them.#People don#t knowthey#re going to have a job at the end of furlough.#If we#re able to start on the th July it gives us half of our summer left, we#d be able to get some of the flights running.#If Scotland had a dferent list of destinations to England that would be the worst possible scenario for us.#At the briefing yesterday, interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said the global situation was “very volatile”.He said: “As community transmission becomes much less across Scotland, one of the considerations we have got to make is how we prevent fresh importations of Covid- from other country.“The situation internationally right now is very volatile, we’re seeing a lot of countries – not just across Europe but across the globe – where there are very changing pictures domestically.“We want to make sure as we take these very important decisions we have got the latest information and data available to us so we can make a very safe decision.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.39700393-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.39700393-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.39700393-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/07/2.39700393-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"one new case of covid 19 detected in north east 2","story":"There has been one new case of coronavirus in the north-east.The north-east’s total number of positive cases since the crisis began has remained at , while  people are currently receiving hospital treatment in the region.Across Scotland there have been seven new confirmed cases and there has been one new death registered in the past  hours.A total of , people have been tested through NHS Scotland labs and UK Government labs to date with results showing , tests were negative and , were positive.As of midnight a total of  were being treated in hospital, with three in intensive care.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 12 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe selfish and reckless behaviour of many people visiting Argyll is to be deplored.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

need to know ahead of the penumbral lunar eclipse.What is it A penumbral lunar eclipse takes place when the moon moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.Why do lunar eclipses happen A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandWhat makes this eclipse dferent According to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.Where should I look People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.When can I see it Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate,

Not even the number  night bus that trundles through Port Seton on an hourly basis.Was it the silence that was keeping me awake  Or was it the fact that, by this time, my mind was racing ahead to the things that I had to do the next day In these recent months, one of the most common things to hear people say is that their sleeping pattern isnrsquot what it once was.I even Googled it and came across an article from a popular news website in which those interviewed recounted how the events of recent months had affected their ability to sleep.It seems that much of this has been caused by the changes to our daily routine.As we have been spending more time at home than usual, wersquore not expending the same energy as we do when times are more lsquonormalrsquo.Even sunny days, when we would normally go out and soak up the sun, are often spent inside the coolness of our homes.And,we are honest, we probably need to add into the mix a certain measure of anxiety.It is not easy to hear even the improving facts and figures that are circulated each day, nor to be reminded that, whilst things might be looking up, such a situation relies on our continued responsible behaviour.As I lay awake, which included thinking about what I would put into this column that you are now reading, I was reminded of the Psalmist in the Old Testament who confesses that sometimes he too lies awake at night, his mind buzzing around from here to there.So, what does he do when he cannot sleep Psalm  and verse : ldquoOn my bed I remember you I think of you through the watches of the night.He turns his attention to God.

As ruins go, therersquos not a huge amount to explore no cramped spiral staircase to squeeze up, or dank cellars to investigate.But for me, such ruins have a dferent appeal. Not based so much on the physical exploration of what remains, but more an imaginative exploration of what we can no longer see.It has really ancient origins, dating back to the ninth century when the first Christian site seems to have been established here. That gives it over a thousand years of Christian connection, and I suspect it may have been a pre-Christian sacred site before that.The first kirk will have been wooden built, but the oldest surviving parts of the stone kirk we see today date from the late th century.On my most recent visit to the kirk, I stood in the nave and tried to imagine what Scotland was like in the s when parts of the walls around me were built. What a totally dferent world from ours, I thought, as I stood in the footsteps of those who stood on the same spot hundreds of years ago.On reflection, perhaps there were more similarities than we may imagine: pestilence, plague and epidemics, injustice and inequality, cruel rulers and pious preachers.There are some information boards with pictorial reconstructions that help us understand what we are looking at, but a ruin like this is the stuff of poetic imagination.Poets such as Shelley were inspired by ruins, and today they are popular visitor attractions all over the world.Compared to the scale of ruins such as the Acropolis or Pompeii, or even compared to nearby ruins such as Dirleton Castle, the old kirk of St Andrew may not impress. I donrsquot think it will ever be a popular tourist attraction.But thatrsquos why I enjoy visiting this place. Itrsquos a ruin with solitude, while ironically being very accessible and amidst a busy part of East Lothian.Over the years I have never personally met anyone  there visiting it. Many people know of it, of course, but because of its unassuming simplicity, I suspect few have got to know it.ldquoTherersquos not much to see, was an honest comment from a friend once. He was right on one level, but I think what we see depends how we look, and how we connect.For me anyway, the magic of this ruined kirk is not in what is visible but in the atmosphere of its story, and its unexpected tranquillity.Once, of course, it was very busy, for it was the place of worship for people from the edge of Aberlady Bay to the fringes of North Berwick, as well as from as far as four miles to the south. Every Sabbath there would have been processions of people from each direction, coming to meet and worship here together.Stand in the nave and you are at the centre of this ancient weekly migration. From here you will see a Norman arch, decorated with chevrons. Although the information board points out the craftsmanship is not of the finest quality, it makes me imagine some poorly paid, yet skilled, local stonemasons doing their best to beauty their kirk and it is certainly good enough.The arch was walled up many years ago, when the chancel became a burial place for the Yule family. So the decorated arch is now embedded in later stone, and looks like a fossil peeking out from a clf face.As I stood admiring it, I thought it had the atmosphere of a walled-up entrance into the past, in which figures from times gone by could emerge or perhaps I could walk through it to another age. Maybe Irsquove been watching too much Outlander .The kirk was used for worship for over  years, and even survived the Reformation. There is an amusing tale of the vicar from that time, which I shared in my first book. I thought of him as I stood in his church.It became a collegiate church in , so prayers were said here constantly by a group of priors to help the soul of the local laird to get into heaven. The prayers were paid for, of course, and one wondersthe laird got value for money.The kirk was finally abandoned around , apparently because of a petition from parishioners.One issue seems to have been the constant covering of sand blown over the kirk and kirkyard by endemic storms. What image does that conjure in our imagination  And what storms must they have been! But also, many people lived miles away from the kirk, as did the laird, and a new, more conveniently situated place of worship was wanted.I can understand this. Itrsquos a fair trek from, say, Dirleton to here, especially on an unpleasant, dark, cold winterrsquos morning. So a new replacement kirk was built at Dirleton, and St Andrewrsquos Kirk fell into disuse. Yet the kirkyard remained in use, and has many of its own tales to tell.I have never been a fan of crowded places, to be honest. Irsquove had my enjoyment of some favourite places ruined by being placed on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list.I doubt the ruins of the old kirk of St Andrew in Gullane will ever be on a tourist lsquomust-seersquo list unless some celebrity gets married there, or itrsquos used as a movie location.It remains for me a wonderful place to visit, and I always spot small details that I missed on previous visits. My kids are fascinated by the stories told on the gravestones.As the lockdown eases, we are all understandably desperate to get out from our confinement and feel free once again to enjoy places. But then we often too readily build a new prison for ourselves by following the herd to overcrowded places where we are crammed into lsquomust-go-torsquo popular places.Maybe a gt from the lockdown is the discovery of those places nearby, less well known, but in their own way special and magical.For me, East Lothian is full of such small, less-well-known, special places, that will never be a on a lsquomust-seersquo list, but are all the more enjoyable for it. This old ruin is one of them for me.It is such places I look forward to visiting as the lockdown eases."},{"url":null,"title":"farewell-alfred-alf-tesoro","story":"He died suddenly of a presumed heart attack at the age of , as he ed to his home in Eskside West after buying his daily newspaper on June .Due to current Covid- restrictions, a private service was conducted on Monday, June , at Inveresk Cemetery by Father Basil Clark, from Our Lady of Loretto Church on Newbigging, Musselburgh.The funeral cortegravege travelled along North High Street, passing his former cafe premises for the last time, to applause from members of the local community who lined the street to pay their respects.His niece Anita Cullinan said: ldquoOur family were truly touched by all who turned up to witness Alfrsquos last journey through Musselburgh ndash people who perhaps personally knew Alf or who had grown up during the years the shop was open.ldquoWersquod like to thank them for turning out and for the deeply respectful applause as the cortegravege passed by.Alf was born in the house above the shop on  North High Street on July , , the middle child of Edoardo Tesoro and Zelinda Costa Tesoro, whose other two children were Eolanda and Bert.Edoardo started the cafe known as A.Tesoro in , and his brother Emilio also started a Tesoro cafe across the bridge in Musselburgh around the same time.

They would have worked seven days a week, from dawn till dusk.Like most Italian immigrants of the time, they built the business from nothing to create a small ice cream factory behind the cafe.The ice cream was made by hand and boiled in small quantities each day in response to the demand. They didnrsquot have a pasteurising machine until after the Second World War, which then allowed larger quantities to be made and stored.Ice was delivered to the cafe each day and kept in a cool cabinet and the ice cream was then made using a secret family recipe, passing from father to son.The ice cream was then delivered by horse and cart to ious places around Portobello and Musselburgh and also distributed by bicycles with cool boxes in front to keep it fresh.They had young lads helping to distribute the ice cream and family members remember Alf saying that they also attended the Musselburgh Racecourse events and dance halls to expand the business.Alf started a car mechanicrsquos course on New Street, Musselburgh, before the war but hadnrsquot completed it before being called up to serve in the British Army as a private in the Argyll  Sutherland Highlanders Regiment.He served in both France and Germany, arriving in Normandy on June , , and spending the rest of the war in France, Holland and Germany.He ed to Musselburgh with the intention to finish his apprenticeship and learn how to drive but, as was so often the case with the eldest son of Italian families at the time, was asked by his father to run the business.His sister, Eolanda, had finished her secretarial studies after the war and met a young Italian called Ricardo Paganuzzi, who she married and who set up an ice cream business called Dinorsquos Cafe in Perth.His younger brother, Bert, went on to study law at the University of Edinburgh after he finished his national service.He married an Edinburgh girl called Catherine OrsquoDonnell, who studied to be a teacher.Alf therefore found himself the last of the siblings left in the business and stayed to continue work until his retirement ndash around  years.After he retired and, in the absence of successors to run the business, he sold up around  and continued to spend his remaining  or so years living very happily in his native Musselburgh.He travelled to the USA and to Canada but mainly spent his annual holidays with his nephew, Dino Paganuzzi, in Switzerland.He went on numerous trips back with Dino to where their family originated, Beverino, in the region of La Spezia in northern Italy, where relatives still live.He announced very shortly after ing from a family trip to Rome that his travelling days were now over, at the age of nearly .Alf was a member of the hiking club run by Our Lady of Loretto Catholic Church, where he seldom missed a Sunday Mass.He also spent many a Saturday at Easter Road in Edinburgh with his brother Bert, watching his beloved Hibs play football.Alf is survived by his nephew Dino Paganuzzi in Switzerland, niece Anita Cullinan, from Edinburgh, cousin Roland Toma, of the Cafe Continental in Gourock, cousin Elena Grippa in Rome, and their children.Many Musselburgh residents took to social media to pay tribute to Alf. Fiona Rutherford posted: ldquoLoved his cafe.Gillian Duffy said: ldquoAlways used to be the place to hang out at Alfiersquos when a teenager.Alan Fraser said: ldquoBrilliant recognition by the people of Musselburgh.Elaine Black added: ldquoHappy memories.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

And while that may seem entirely counter-intuitive as we emerge from a pandemic that has made us comply with lockdown rules and fearful of a trip to the supermarket, I believe it is essential that we make these qualities core to our education system.If the disruption caused by Covid- within our schools has given us one advantage it is that we have the opportunity to reset our education priorities. Home schooling and the likelihood of blended learning options in the future have forced a greater adoption of digital s and advanced the need for greater digital skills.Inevitably, this has highlighted the gaps in digital access that need to be addressed urgently, but it has also raised issues around how to engage all students and what skills we choose to nurture and encourage.I went to a school in Dundee that literally threw opportunities at us and for me the one experience that led to success as an adult was the chance to create my own business as part of the Young Enterprise ScotlandCompany Programme. I had a mentor and learned resilience and communication, but fundamentally it took away any mystery around the world of work.As I set out on my own business career, therefore, any fear of not being able to do something was taken away as I had already done it. I realised that I also had the capability to take strong managed risks, without which nothing would have happened.This summer, more than  Scottish school students passed the first ever YES Company Programme ldquoHigher and for me, these young people provide a blueprint for the way forward. They learn by doing and will take forward an entrepreneurial spirit that will be invaluable to Scotlandrsquos economic recovery.Moreover, the Company Programme has been shown to have disproportionately strong impacts for the most disadvantaged group of young people, because by demystying business it demonstrates to these pupils that people in top jobs are not wizards.As a measure of that success, this month sees the launch of the YES membership of Gather, a global network of JAalumni, who are still driven to share ideas and create products and services to drive profit for good. It offers a means to connect and find new sources of inspiration. It is also a timely reminder that we need to continue to be outward-looking and aspirational at a time when working lives are being put under ious constraints.As YES alumni we still have a role to play. This may be through mentoring and coaching. It may well be through supporting teachers and schools find a way to embed greater digital learning into the school curriculum. Or, perhaps, more importantly, it is by ensuring that experiential learning is not lost at a time when having the courage to be innovative and enterprising is fundamental to Scotlandrsquos path through the economic consequences of coronavirus.Enterprise is a framework to help young people think about and deal with what lies ahead, how we build this into every school day is now both a challenge and for me a priority.Chris van der Kuyl is CEO and founder of J Studios, an alumni of the Young Enterprise Scotland Company Programme and a former Chairman of the charity."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andy-mciver-unionists-given-just-asleep","story":"Inasmuch as truth is relevant in the puerility of Scottish constitutional debate, I feel compelled to begin with my view on the matter.I am not exercised by constitutional politics. Nationality, for me, evokes contentedness, at best, rather than pride. I canrsquot get excited about which flags fly on buildings, what colour my passport is, or whether a copy of The Gruffalo is available in Scots. Indeed, I find the all-too-prevalent Scottish and British exceptionalism cringeworthy and insular, especially in those areas where we claim world-leading status when all the sensible evidence points to the contrary.Although I would have been prepared to vote Yes, I voted No in  based solely on my view that Scotlandrsquos inherited fiscal deficit combined with the leftism of a new, ideologised nation would leave me and my family poorer for a signicant period of time.:Support for Scottish independence surges in new poll as SNP look set for landslide victory at Holyrood electionsThe  campaign made me feel that a Yes vote would be an act of personal self-harm a virtue signalling affirmation of non-Englishness. The stuff of a second Scottish Enlightenment it was not.That said, polling trends are now clear enough to be sure that, slowly but most definitely surely, the country is moving towards independence. From the : position of , the No vote has gradually declined. Evenwe strip out polling during the pandemic, which may fairly be seen to be skewed by a seismic current event, numbers for No now normally tend to be in the low rather than the mid-fties.Since the peak of coronavirus passed, Yes has begun to build what may be seen as a psephologically consistent lead. This particular set of warning signs for unionistswere there in the polling conducted by Ipsos MORI for the BBC in May, in which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was given a net approval rating of % for her handling of the pandemic. Only one-in-eight people thought she was doing badly.That means, plainly, that a large number of died-in-the-wool unionists thought that Ms Sturgeon was doing a good job. As soon as I saw that poll I wondered whether unionist leaders north and south, who have long hitched their wagon to the negative perceptions of Ms Sturgeon that they claim to hear on the famous doorsteps, would understand the potential implications of their people offering her their approval, even during a crisis.The question in my head, now, is this: have the unionists given up, or are they just asleep at the wheel To be sure, positives for nationalists are plentul. Simple demographics play their part bluntly, young people are more likely to be ideological nationalists, and unionists are more likely to die. Secondly, without being pejorative about Boris Johnson, on whom the jury remains out, the very presence in Downing Street of a figure largely unpopular in Scotland also helps the case, especially when he and his partyrsquos demise still seems distant. And, thirdly, the uncertainty ushered in by Brexit, in a nation which did not vote for it, is another push factor for soft unionist Remainers.However it would also be a mistake to think that this most recent trend towards nationalism is particularly sticky. Ms Sturgeonrsquos communications around coronavirus has been as outstanding as it must have been exhausting, but her strategy has so far been a near carbon-copy of Mr Johnsonrsquos.During a crisis, opinions are transient and often frankly hysterical. So all should not be lost for unionists. And, yet, their prospects look bleak. Bleak not because of the last two months, or even the last two years, but as a result of decades of poor strategy, guided by emotional anti-nationalism rather than calm, clinical calculation.One word sums up British unionism: ldquoreactive. The Smith Commission was a reaction to the independence referendum result. The Calman Commission was a reaction to the SNP winning in . Devolution itself was a reaction to nationalist strength.Unionism is forever chasing the curve of Scottish public opinion. It is never ahead of it. It is never proactive. If it wants to save itself, it now needs to be. If unionists think they can just say no to indyref  and eventually it will all go away, theyrsquove not been paying attention.Unionism has some strong fundamentals in its favour. Firstly, it may well be the case that at any future independence referendum voter fatigue plays a signicant role. Scots have, in six years, been asked to decide upon their future in the UK and their future in the EU, have faced three general elections and a Scottish election, with another around the corner, not to mention enduring the coronavirus crisis, during which their job has a good chance of having been saved by a UK Chancellor. They might simply think ldquoenough is enough.That is, perhaps, rather a depressing reason to vote No. But there are more uplting ones. The transfer of such large volumes of No voters to Yes over recent years means that, by definition, a large proportion of the vote is soft. It can go back under the right conditions.:Never before have the foundations of support for the Union looked so weak - Professor Sir John CurticeThose right conditions, I think, inevitably involve the proactive creation of a New Unionism, discussed in some quarters but not so far ostensibly embraced by anyone with their hands on the levers of power.This New Unionism would read the changing mood, not just in Scotland but also in Northern Ireland and even to a degree in Wales, and try to get ahead of it. It would almost certainly move beyond the immature unionist debate which presumes power to be binary, either shting from Westminster to Holyrood or vice versa, either a strong Scotland or a strong Britain, and instead enhance the role of both parliaments and governments through a structure built to last for decades, rather than one built to last until the next time the SNP does well at an election.When you ask two unionists how to defeat nationalism you get five dferent answers. Unless they settle on a New Unionism in short order, they will probably still be arguing with each other when the independence train leaves the station.Andy Maciver is Director of Message Matters"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-can-afford-stand-china","story":"Despite our tendency to come up with labels such as Spanish flu, however, itrsquos hardly fair to attribute responsibility for diseases to the places where they happen to pop up in. In any case, the really unhealthy thing about China, and the one that should alarm the West, is in the body politic.The recent actions of its government, which include the new national security law in Hong Kong, its illegal incursion and military engagement in the Galwan river valley in India, and its systematic rounding up of Uighur Muslims, more than a million of whom have been put in concentration camps in what the UN says amounts to genocide, ought to be a reminder that the despotic Communist regime remains wedded to the principle outlined by Mao Tse-Tung, that ldquopolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.In the case of Hong Kong, you could hardly get a more obvious example of the regimersquos authoritarian instincts ndash as well as a blithe disregard for the legal undertakings it gave before the handover, which promised that there would be no change in the law for at least  years, and that the territoryrsquos special status would be maintained. Instead, the new law essentially makes it a criminal offence to argue for democracy, and makes a free press impossible. Already, there has been the removal from libraries of books on liberty.It is greatly to the discredit of Western democracies that, for the past  years or so, there has been little attempt to draw attention to, let alone challenge, this repulsive dictatorship. We donrsquot seem even to be able to resist the imposition of a mobile phone network that may well be compromised by the Chinese security services, which have a stellar track record of spying on their own population and restricting their access to information.Itrsquos not just that, since the Tiananmen Square massacre of , in which thousands died, wersquove largely ignored the oppression of the Chinese people by their government after all, despite a few token protests when their president tips up, wersquove ignored the plight of illegally occupied Tibet for almost seven decades, and Taiwan, which practically no Western nationofficially recognises, and which we wonrsquot even admit to the UN in case Beijing gets huffy.Itrsquos that we appear to have convinced ourselves that, because China has embraced aspects of capitalism and become much more affluent in recent decades, that we can just forget about the fact that itrsquos still a dictatorship as tyrannical as that other Peoplersquos Republic in North Korea, which is the countryrsquos only official ally.That may have something to do with the fact that prosperity and freedom seem to be related with very few exceptionsliberty, along with property rights and the rule of law, seems to be a requirement for a sustained and successful economy. Command economies, even when they have enormous natural advantages, as Venezuela and Zimbabwe did, tend to go bust after enslaving and immiserising their citizens.And China, despite the skyscrapers of Shanghai and the worldrsquos largest number of billionaires, is not quite the economic success it might appear it may have embraced commerce ndash it is the worldrsquos largest exporter and second-largest importer ndash but not free trade. Its financial gains are slightly less stellar than its position as the worldrsquos second-largest economy by nominal GDP and the speed of its growthmight suggest, and it is certainly not evenly distributed. The middle class may now number around  million, but the country has . billion citizens, and an awful lot of debt.In per capita output, China is still a middle-income nation, ranked somewhere between th and nd , depending on how you measure it, behind such powerhouses as Gabon, Suriname and the Dominican Republic. By contrast, Macau, Hong Kong and Singapore are all in the top  by almost every estimation.In the past two decades, according to the Heritage Foundation, China has added about  trillion to its GDP, which sounds impressive. But in the same time, the United States added about  trillion to its, with a population less than one-fth the size, and with much lower levels of growth.None of this, naturally, alters the fact that, quite apart from being one of the worldrsquos oldest and greatest cultures, China is the worldrsquos most populous country, third or fourth biggest, one of its most signicant military powers and probably the only place that really rivals the US. These are all reasons why no one, and particularly not the UK, is going to start kicking the Chinese around.But it does provide some cause to question the orthodox opinion that it is about to overtake America as a superpower, that the two are in some form of new Cold War, or that it ndash as opposed to, say, India ndash is bound to dominate the next century. Its undoubted importance, evenyoursquore just talking about size, is certainly no reason why we should let it kick us around with impunity.Wersquore obviously not going to attack it ndash and nor, I imagine is the US Field-Marshal Montgomeryrsquos second rule of war was not to take on land armies in China . Nor are we going to ignore it as a producer or a market.

It aims to encourage people of all ages to participate safely and responsibly in dferent foraging activities, and to become more aware of the benefits of wild plants around us. With restrictions in place for large events due to Covid-, the festival has transformed into a virtual event, which is hoped will bring it to an even wider audience.Foraging Fortnight is being run in partnership with Orkney International Science Festival, as part of its rich programme of talks, outings and activities. The events encourage adherence to Scotlandrsquos Outdoor Access Code and organisers have put together foraging guidelines to ensure that those taking part are doing so in a safe and responsible way.Foraged ingredients have become a familiar addition to some restaurant menus including at Wedgwood in Edinburgh, run by renowned chef Paul Wedgwood. His passion for foraging and discovering ingredients to bring to his menu at the restaurant has grown to the extent that he now runs courses for people who want to know more.The eaterie in the heart of Edinburghrsquos Old Town, adapted in lockdown and turned the business around in weeks including home delivery and also bespoke dinning at home.And while there have been restrictions in place during lockdown Mr Wedgwood has still managed to keep foraged items on the menu. He has combined his daily walk with a chance to find some of the seasonal foraged ingredients to add to his dishes.He said: ldquoIt is quite easy to find foraged items even on a local walk and it is a case of starting off with a couple of items and being able to recognise them. You learn their characteristics the more you do it. Something like nettles are very common and can be used in a soup. For beginners starting off there are apps they can easily download.

Covid- has starkly revealed that some of our everyday lives have clear measurable impacts. A desire to Build Back Better, to restore our economy but also protect our planet and create green jobs has grown. With a recent BBC poll finding that  per cent of people think climate change is as serious as Covid-, itrsquos vital we listen to what they want.Key workers in recycling and waste management have performed an essential service during the pandemic and now, the sector so vital to driving a better environment, must answer the demand to drive a greener recovery.Even during such a devastating crisis, or perhaps because of it, we must think again about the waste we produce. We must drive resource re-use, end waste exports and ert from landfill to achieve a zero-waste economy.For Viridor, the key to unlocking this change is to see waste as a resource, and not as rubbish turning packaging and products back into new products which are reused here in Scotland. This could create new skilled jobs while driving down waste and carbon emissions. Making sure waste is truly valuable is key to ensuring what we discard does not escape the recycling net, going on to harm our environment.Last week we launched our vision of how we might make build back better a reality in Scotland. A Scottish Circular Economy and Innovation Park. A site dedicated to moving towards a zero-waste economy where our waste is reprocessed into new materials to be reused in Scotland. A site that brings major new investment and green jobs with a better environment. A site that meets the hopes and expectations of the Scottish people.But this vision is far bigger than one company. This is why we brought together  people in this sector, including Scotlandrsquos Minister for Trade, Ivan McKee Sepa CEO Terry ArsquoHearn, Scottish Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, Heriot-Watt University and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce. Innovating to make a zero-waste economy, securing Scottish investment, creating green jobs can only be doneeveryone works together.Mr McKee noted the ldquotime had come for Scotland to be clear about the infrastructure investment required to deliver the world-leading circular economy it is committed to. This is crucial. Recycling and reprocessing of plastics, glass, paper and card does not happen without a signicant investment. This sentiment and ambition were matched by the Princess Royal who, in a video message recorded specically for the event, noted that investing in the circular economy is key to ldquogiving our young people the opportunity to play a major role in the world they will inherit.Time and again, people focused the opportunity we have to ensure Scotland emerges from this crisis with a brighter future. Too many Scottish resources are being lost to export along with the investment and jobs that goes with it. If we stand back and respond to what people want, this crisis could spur a truly sustainable economy and ensure the recycling sector remains more relevant than ever.Investment in the crucial recycling infrastructure needed to create a zero-waste economy and retain our resources in Scotland cannot be achieved overnight nor by any one organisation. Now is the time to start working together, to define the skills and innovation required and to invest in the future to ensure we emerge from this crisis better and stronger.Tim Rotheray is Viridor Director of Innovation and Regulation"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  There is method to the madness of spend  spend  spend","story":"Advocates include Democrat Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the economist Stephanie Kelton and the Labour-supporting tax specialist Richard Murphy.

But we are concerned that all the optimistic talk may end up being just thatit is not backed up by specic actions. Yes, Scotland can build a positive legacy out of lockdown, but we need to focus on the practicalities of that, not just the aspiration.CAS doesnrsquot claim to have all the answers here. But with our unique perspective of  years of helping people deal with their problems, we feel we understand the issues that need to be addressed, and we are keen to contribute to making the re-boot happen.So over the summer we will use our weekly column here to set out in detail how we believe public policy needs to be re-focused. We will look at the role of social security how we can help people stay in their homes how debt holds iniduals back and hampers wider economic recovery and how telecommunications can be used to keep people connected both socially and to services. Today I will start by looking at the issue of employment and workers rights.Since the start of lockdown the proportion of advice the Scottish Citizens Advice network has given about employment has swelled to three times what is typical. Itrsquos been our biggest area of growth during the pandemic. And in particular, in the first three weeks of June, one in five pieces of employment advice we gave was about redundancy.So, while the Job Retention Schemewas a bold and necessary measure, both governments need to think now about how to protect existing jobs as the economy recovers.We would like the UK Government to consider greater flexibility in the timescales for winding down the furlough scheme, taking into consideration the needs of dferent sectors, and the dferent pace to the easing of lockdown in Scotland and other parts of the UK. Wersquod also like to see ongoing protection for workers who need to shield because they are more vulnerable to Covid-. For the medium term we would urge more investment in new jobs, particularly in sectors that can have wider social benefit.Scotlandrsquos transition to net zero can be supported by investment in energy efficiency improvements for homes, which reduces fuel bills for iniduals while boosting employment.We also welcome the Enterprise  Skills Strategic Board in Scotlandrsquos focus on employment for young people, older low-skilled, low-waged workers and women. Since long before Covid-, we have been concerned by the prevalence of low-paid and insecure work, which makes it hard for people to budget and to balance caring responsibilities.Many of these workers have been among the hardest hit by the financial impact of the pandemic ndash unable to access the furlough scheme or statutory sick pay. Others have found themselves out on the frontline, providing key services like care and food retail whilst better paid workers have been able to continue their work safely from home.Scotland cannot plan a recovery on the basis of training everyone on a low wage into so-called ldquohigh-quality jobs, because recent months have highlighted how critical many of those low-paid jobs are. Instead, the value of those jobs needs to be recognised in a new deal for those in traditionally low-paid sectors. A new deal based on higher wages, better terms and conditions and greater flexibility around caring responsibilities. This would involve prioritising the Scottish Governmentrsquos Fair Work agenda, with the care sector being an obvious place to start.These are not radical or new ideas, but without these kinds of changes many workers will continue to rely on benefits to top up low pay. And the social security system as it was pre-lockdown was not fit for purpose and is another area that must be reformedwe are to have any chance of building that fairer country we all want to see.And we will outline our ideas for those reforms here in coming weeks.Mhoraig Green is Social Justice spokesperson at Citizens Advice Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"kate-forbes-joins-forces-welsh-northern-irish-counterparts-plea-powers","story":"Scotlandrsquos Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has previously called on the Chancellor to draw up pound billion spending plans to revive the UK economy ndash and has alsopleaded for greater borrowing powers to ensure officials in Edinburgh can better equip the country to reboot as the lockdown is eased.MsForbes initial request was ldquokicked into the long grass but she has now been handed the support of her Welsh counterpart Rebecca Evans andNorthern Irelandrsquos Finance Minister Conor Murphy.The joint plea is calling for flexibility to be able to switch funding for capital infrastructure projects to be used for day-to-day spending ndash as well as removing limits on devolved governmentsrsquo borrowing powers.MsForbesis calling on the Chancellor to ldquoease these rigid fiscal rules to help Scotland ldquoproperly address themonumentalchallenges facing the economy.:Kate Forbes draws up poundbn proposals to re-start UK economy and avoid austerityShe added:ldquoThe powers we are seeking will enable the Scottish Government to respond to Covid- more effectively and reboot our economy.ldquoThey are relatively limited powers but would ease some of the immense pressures on our budget and give us more tools to kickstart our recovery.ldquoAt the moment, any extra money spent bolstering services and supporting the economy recovery must be taken from other areas. That creates risk for our essential public services, jobs and businesses.Ms Forbes party colleague, the SNPs Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has also called on the UK Government to \"step up\" and offer more funding and flexibility to devolved administrations.He said: \"The Chancellor must give a cast-iron guarantee that the Tory government will devolve, not withhold, the financial powers and funds necessary to secure a strong recovery in Scotland.:Kate Forbes: Full fiscal autonomy would help Scotland respond fully to Covid- crisis\"This is an unprecedented crisis and it requires an unprecedented response.

He has said he believes fans are the reason why no current professionals have come out as gay.He became the first male English footballer to come out since Justin Fashanu in . Mr Fashanu came out while still playing top flight professional football in the US.

It is that footballers are frightened. It is fear that stops them from coming out.\"I have a friend who is an agent and he told me the first gay footballer would make an absolute fortune because big companies would want to be associated with the first footballer to come out. Financially it would be very lucrative for that footballer.\"I suspect it is the fear that they are going to be harassed online and they might not feel safe walking in the street in certain communities and that they would have a target on their back as the first person to person to come out.\"That really is shocking in the st century.\"What seems to me, speaking as a gay man myself, is that footballers are in an enormously privileged position. The high profile ones are very wealthy, they can protect themselves from immediate physical danger. Andthey are too scared to come out, what does that say to kids living up and down the country, who look at them and say thathe doesnt feel safe coming out, what hope is there for me in my housing scheme, or estate. That is the real worry about this.Magdalena Eriksson\"I feel we have been talking about this for years. When I was on this select committee in , and recommended a homophobia in sport inquiry which we did, there were no gay footballers out and here we are five years on and there are still no gay footballers out.\"I dont detect urgency in football administration to change this. I dont recognise a concern about this.:Mark Smith -I know there are gay footballers in Scotland because I tried to convince one to go public\"There is some concern but it doesnt seem to be a pressing concern.\"The SNP MP said that Richard Masters, chief executive of the English Premier League had told MPs that footballers that came out would be embraced by the game which he said was a far more welcoming place in . But he also conceded that it was a failure in the game that a player had not felt able to do so.But Mr Nicolson said: \"I dont have any sense at all that it is a far more welcoming place. By definition,it was a far more welcoming place, people would feel free to come out.\"His commentary came in a discussion with Paul Cleal, an adviser to several relevant organisations including the Premier League who told him that mens football was \"not welcoming enough\".He believed football was more concerned about behaviour of people in the stadia and social media, which he said was \"a shame\".A spokesman for the FA the governing body of football in England said: \"Coming out, irrespective of gender, is an inidual and personal decision. Having a support network and allies, whether thatrsquos teammates, friends or family, can be crucial in this process and we will always offer the full support of The FA to anybody that chooses to come out.\"We continue to work with our partners across the game, such as Stonewall, LGBT fan groups, campaign groups and the leagues, to help create a safe and comfortable environment for any player to come outthey wish to do so.

If we are all considerate to each other’s needs, people will feel safer and go out more, which may reduce loneliness and social isolation and help with their health and wellbeing.”The information sheet has been endorsed by Transport Scotland, Public Health Scotland, Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland as well as Cycling Scotland, Forth Environment Link, Living streets, Paths for All, Ramblers Scotland, Scottish Canals and Sustrans Scotland.To access the information sheet, visit: www.sustrans.org.uk about-us our-work-in-scotland walking-cycling-and-wheeling-during-covid--in-scotland copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After eating far too many patisseries, she enrolled at the Alain Ducasse cookery school to learn how to make macarons. She said: “They’re just so pretty. They’re so delicate. And they’re quite hard to make because there’s a lot that can go wrong.”Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business.She said: “I wanted to have that little bit of Paris with me. I focused on taste bud tourism, so when you eat these macarons you’re transported to the Champs-Élysées.” After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store.She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” vw, px\"  But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary.The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus.Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.“We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over £, worth of overdue invoices.”But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go. I cried.“I just felt like I was stuck in this moral quandary. Do we keep going and safeguard the business, so there’s a business for everyone to come back to  Or do I shut down because I can see that this is causing people severe anguish  We managed to recall stock that was sitting in hospitality clients freezers. That is the only reason we survived. What you make, you keep in the freezer and you use when you need to. It’s not like it’s a cupcake,we were perishable goods we would never have survived.”“We have a big kitchen so the space isn’t the issue. It’s more that we wanted to keep the team safe,” adds Rachel.Mademoiselle Macaron’s online sales have increased so much that they’re potentially in a position to hire more people on temporary contracts. Ideally, Rachel would like to help younger people and develop a training program with a college. “They’ve been so much more affected, and it’s just something close to my heart,” she said. vw, px\"  But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships.Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in .He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.“Our aspiration was much smaller than that, in fact we just wanted to convert the six outlying buildings into self catering units – now we’re a  bedroom hotel.”Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove.Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market.Neil said: It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . We had built up all our bookings for this financial year.“And then of course the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. Not just for Routescape, but for The Grove too.”Neil added: “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.”When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested £.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low.But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road.Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow.“Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves.“But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man.“So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.”However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of £, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs.Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month.“Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers.Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Everyone is in the same boat trying to step-up and deliver.“Before anyone had heard of Covid- we were already planning to equip GP practices for appointments and started that in October last year.”On March  national guidance was issued asking boards to accelerate the roll-out of the technology in an effort to curb the spread of the virus across the country.Kenny added: “Ultimately the increase in Near Me appointments has protected both our patients and staff from possible infection. We were looking to gradually introduce it but events over took that. We have trained more than  clinicians in range of specialisms since then.“There are benefits to Near Me over phone consultations and evidence shows visually you can pick-up signs and body language far more than on a phone call. So where it is clinically appropriate to do so we are having as many of these using Near Me as possible.“The initial focus was on enabling GP Practices, attention was shted to Mental Health Services, AHP and other clinical services traditionally delivered from the Balfour as the pandemic response developed. Working closely with service leads, training was delivered, equipment put in place and appointment processes modied to mirror the GP roll-out.“Uptake from both patients and clinicians has been very encouraging. Our Mental Health service has been able to meet the demands within the community at a time of increased anxiety and isolation.”He added that the uptake across the entire Mental Health Team led to them being asked to contribute to a national learning event to share their experiences.“Our maternity service is also doing very well and, despite only recently taking up the use of the technology, was similarly invited to contribute to a future national learning event due to its success,” Kenny said.“GP Simon Kemp from Daisy Villa has been selected, as one of only six practices in Scotland, to be part of a joint project with NHS Scotland and the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop guidance and help embed virtual appointment within GP practices across Scotland.“Near Me isn#t just about a response to Covid- – it was around before the pandemic. The trick for us is going to be to embed it and it can be the new normal in the future as we continue to protect our community.“For Orkney it has many benefits including providing care closer to home and reducing spend in relation to off island patient travel.“Going forward we will be targeting specialities where we have high numbers of patients travelling – sometimes on a three day round trip. We will work closely with our partner boards to ensure that the recent momentum continues and that the virtual clinic option becomes #business as usual#, where it is clinically appropriate to do so.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He bought a field from William Isbister of Kethesgeo and hired Samuel Baikie. Baikie’s obituary says that he designed the hotel but the local story was that it had been a show-house at the  Glasgow Exhibition. Perhaps the plans came from the Exhibition.Good though the fishing was, John Mackay wanted to make it even better. He got some trout spawn and put the fry he had hatched in a specially built pond at Stairwaddy. A year later, he had a lot of good- sized fish.The hotel opened in June . It had a coffee room, drawing room, smoking room, fteen bedrooms, lavatories and one bathroom. The Orkney Herald thought for beauty and comfort it could not be excelled in the north. The first phone line in Orkney connected the hotel to the Masons Arms and this featured in the advertising.In , Mackay had an “Illustrated Guide to Orkney” printed. The useful information included the charges for Maeshowe:- sixpence for one person one shilling for more than one, up to four persons and for more than four, threepence per person, up to ten shillings, the maximum charge for one party. In WWI, Houton was the main seaplane base but late in  it was decided to increase the number in Orkney from  to , to fight the threat of submarines, and a camp was built in Stenness. The Admiralty had not listened to the locals but soon found out that they were right, and the loch was too shallow. The planes were moved to Houton but the hotel remained the HQ of the Naval Air Service.At the end of WWI, another long running battle restarted, as John Mackay fought the Temperance movement. Stromness was dry from  to  and campaigners were determined that Stenness would be the same. Successive owners promised not to sell drink to locals, but it was no use, the petitions kept coming.John Mackay died in  and the hotel was briefly owned by Mrs Jessie Smith. The Misses Catherine and Jessie Harper from Thurso took it over in , announcing they were going to bring it up to date.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a particular interest in social history.

It is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Half of you I love madly, and the other half scares me. I canrsquot take him. I wish I could, but I canrsquot.ldquoThe problem is, I never really know understand which one Irsquom dealing with until itrsquos too late.ldquoThe drinking assures me that I am dealing with the monster. The abused, scared, insecure, violent little boy. I just canrsquot tell where the line starts.The barrister said to Mr Depp: ldquoYour answer to Ms Heardrsquos allegation that you were a serial domestic abuser was that this is a hoax.Mr Depp replied: ldquoHoax is probably the best word one could use because the allegations, all of the allegations, are patently untrue.ldquoFrom hearing you read out this , that was not sent to me, and from some of the information I have garnered from my experience yesterday and having studied the case, I will suggest, marsquoam, that it appears to me that Ms Heard was building a dossier very early on that appears to be an insurance policy for later.During his second day in the witness box, Mr Depp faced further questioning on his drug use, allegations of violence, his relationship with Ms Heard and accusations of jealousy.The star denied slapping Ms Heard three times after she laughed at his ldquoWino Forever tattoo during a time when he had ldquofallen off the wagon. vw,vw,px, px\"Amber Heard arrives at the High Court Ms Wass asked Mr Depp about the alleged incident in March , and the tattoo he had done on his arm during his relationship with actress Winona Ryder, which originally read ldquoWinona Forever but was changed to ldquoWino Forever after they split.The barrister put it to Mr Depp that he slapped his former we three times during the incident, to which he replied: ldquoIrsquom sorry but that is not true, you are mistaken.The court heard details of an alleged incident in Hicksville, Calornia, in June  ndash one of  allegations of domestic violence NGN relies on as part of its defence to Mr Depprsquos claim, all of which the star denies.Ms Heard claims he became ldquoenraged and ldquojealous when one of her friends, referred to as Kelly Sue and described as having been ldquovery close to Ms Heard, touched her.Ms Wass said to Mr Depp: ldquoYou started to get angry, lsquothe monsterrsquo joined the party and you took exception to a woman who was in your group called Kelly Sue.Mr Depp said he did ldquotake exception, saying: ldquoShe was putting her hands on Amber and I thought it was an uncomfortable position to put her in.He denied becoming extremely angry and shouting at her, saying: ldquoI removed Miss Kelly Suersquos hand from Ms Heardrsquos body and told her not to do that.Mr Depp was asked about another alleged incident in March , when Ms Heard claims he hit her several times after an argument about a painting by her ex-partner, Tasya van Ree, which was hanging in her bedroom.Ms Wass asked: ldquoWould you describe yourself as jealous , to which he replied: ldquoI am, yes. I can be jealous.The barrister said: ldquoYou were very jealous and accusatory of Ms Heard, suggesting that she was having, or continuing, her affair with Tasya van Ree ndash it became an obsession of yours that night.Mr Depp said: ldquoI remember we had several arguments about Ms van Ree, I wonrsquot elaborate.He later denied allegations put to him by Ms Wass that he tried to remove the painting and to set fire to it, saying each time they were ldquonot true.Ms Wass also asked about an incident in which Ms Heardrsquos dog ldquohad eaten some hash, some cannabis ndash quite a lot.Mr Depp said: ldquoThe puppy got a hold of a little ball of hashish and just scooped it up before I could get to it.The actorrsquos case against NGN and Mr Wootton arises out of the publication of an article on The Sunrsquos website on April   with the headline ldquoGone Potty: How can JK Rowling be lsquogenuinely happyrsquo casting we beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film .NGN is defending the article as true and says Mr Depp was ldquocontrolling and verbally and physically abusive towards Ms Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and or drugs between early  and May , when the couple split.In a written outline of Mr Depprsquos case, his barrister David Sherborne said the article made ldquodefamatory allegations of the utmost seriousness, accusing him of committing serious assaults on Ms Heard and ldquoinflicting such serious injuries that she feared for her le.Mr Sherborne said: ldquoThe articles amount to a full-scale attack on the claimant as a lsquowe beaterrsquo, guilty of the most horrendous physical abuse.ldquoThe claimantrsquos position is clear ndash Ms Heardrsquos allegations are complete lies.A separate libel claim brought by Mr Depp against Ms Heard in the US, over a December  column in the Washington Post ndash which said the actress received ldquothe full force of our culturersquos wrath for women who speak out, but did not mention Mr Depp by name ndash is due to begin in January.The pair met in  and began living together in  before marrying in Los Angeles in February .Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

They were aimed at informing communities about the process around the closure of their local church, and the future options for the buildings.Unfortunately only the Sand Church event, on the West Side on Thursday th March was able to take place.As a result the Rev Fran Henderson, transition minister for the Shetland parish, has now invited all interested people to take part in an online buildings consultation to ensure all views are reflected.Dr Henderson said: “Ideally, we would have had face-to-face public community meetings about the upcoming closures, but unfortunately only one – at Sand Church – was able to go ahead due to the lockdown measures.“We are concerned that communities need to have their say on what’s going to happen to our church buildings when they are sold, so we have therefore moved our public consultation online.“No guarantees can be made, but alongside our legal duties as charity trustees, all suggestions and requests received will be taken fully into consideration as we make decisions about the future of these buildings and their contents.”The newly launched buildings consultation surveys are composed of  questions each, with some slight iations according to local circumstances.

and what a scrap it turned out to be.Five players reduced their handicaps but there could only be one winner, and that was Robert Macaskill.Off the first tee at am his golf was very steady with  bfs required to navigate the outward nine but a miserly  hits required to conclude his great round.His #touch# round the greens was apparently sensitive in the extreme with a chip-in for par on , #up and down# from Billy the Bunker on , a chip-in birdie on  and several other good chances.All in all just a very good, tidy performance. points then for loop one and  points for loop two and that strong finish was to be the decisive factor as his margin of victory was only decided by virtue of the #better inward half# in a photo-finish with good friend and Vice-Captain Ally Young who was to submit his tremendous score in very inclement playing conditions some  hours later!Ally#s two nines, off his  handicap were  and  with a birdie thrown into each loop for good measure and a stableford points conversion for his halves of  and  points respectively.Incidentally, the putter must have been behaving because it holed a  foot putt on the fourth hole and a  footer on the th for #birds#.NB it was the tool and not the workman.Ally also had the consolation of reducing his handicap by two shots # the biggest reduction among the prizewinners # because of the status of his exact handicap which, like all players is calculated to the decimal point.We had enough jargon last week so we#ll let that slip by unnoticed shall we No question his was the better performance in the respective conditions but it#s Robert who will receive the trophy-and quite properly regain the bragging rights in the house of Macaskill.Two points behind the leaders a trio of players each ed very respectable totals of points.Andrew Long made contact with the ball  times on his outward half with the highlight being a good birdie on the dficult th hole and required but  strokes coming home with a remarkable run of ten straight pars from holes  to .John Maclean played steadily, albeit with early drama in his round # a nasty triple-bogey seven on the second hole.Chapfallen  No chance as composure regained he recorded  for his first lap of the circuit followed by  blows next time round.Ross Cumming#s two nines were  and  off his #mark# so in the company of his #old fella# that day he showed who was #the man#.Ross too suffered an early dig in the ribs with a triple bogey on the second hole but also did well to recover and tickle a touch off the handicap on completion of his round.No midweek competition for the gents this time round but the ‘Trouts’ came out to play in a pop-up Seniors Mixed Stableford competition later that week.With outdoor catering billed as an #attraction# for the silver sharpshooters the beau monde of the area swarmed like locusts to the feast.The format for the day was successful as almost  of the area#s finest ladies and gentlemen golfers paraded their skills on a course displaying promising signs of extremely rude health # apart from the reepach humple on the second fairway # and it was to be an overseas raider who was tohome victorious.Ally #Doc# Mackenzie, now domiciled in Plockton was to be #the man# with an extremely comfortable victory following a rich harvest of points in the forgiving Stableford format.His winning total of  points was four clear of Chris Mackinnon in second place.Alaisdair # a #friend# said his father couldn#t spell # rather limped out in  strokes but a fine  off his  mark coming home garnered a whopping  points to add to the earlier  and his unassailable total.Nothing much of interest in the  but an evil nine and an excellent wee two showed the extremes to which our man travelled on his homeward journey.Rumour has it that #our hero# offered to buy free drinks for everyone # in the sure and certain knowledge that with the lockdown still to be relaxed his money was safe!I also have it on good authority that his often misunderstood droll countenance momentarily offered a fleeting smile of satisfaction in victory before swtly and almost immediately reverting to type.Chris Mackinnon started brightly with only three dozen shots required to pilot his ball round the opening nine holes but  coming home with an horrendous triple bogey  on the final hole may have left a wee bit of a bitter taste in the mouth afterwards.Third place went to Dave Webster who ed a very impressive total of  points off his  handicap mark but a few more performances like that and he could be back playing with the big boys again.The size of the field offers a wee bit more scope for reflection and Donalda Johnston found form and Peter Mackenzie, kin to the winner smoothed in one further point behind Dave Webster.Honourable mention too for George Neill who might have #thought he was Archie# having recorded two birdies in his opening seven holes but sadly thereafter the ba# burst.And finally to the mystery of the #Captain#s eagle#.It#s been dficult trying to untangle the whole story occurring as it did in an unofficial, non-counting charity game but a source, when catechised offered the following description -#a Phil Mickelson-type shot landed like a dislodged swan#s feather on the green with precisely the correct velocity to carry it to the hole with not a millimetre to spare#!What preceded the shot that elicited that magniloquent delineation is still to be ascertained. .

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

EXPERTISE“Robin has given up his time willingly to do whatever he could to ensure Chamber supported our local businesses.“ I am glad to say that Robin will remain as a Management Committee member and that Eugene, Leigh and the rest of the Management Committee will continue to have the benefit of Robin’s knowledge and expertise and of course his array of jokes which always help cheer up the most dficult of meetings.” Tom noted that both Eugene and Leigh have been members of the Management Committee for some time and have already shown that they are eager to do whatever they can to sustain and promote business in the local area. “I am looking forward to working with our new officials and cannot wait for normality towhen we can hold our AGM in safety and be able to meet our members in person.“ In the meantime I hope everyone stays safe and wish all our businesses good fortune as they begin to re-open and get back to some type of normality.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210337.jpg--.jpg?1593777214000\n","title":"shop local and shop safe is message to customers as town re opens","story":"Mid and East Antrim Mayor, Cllr Peter Johnston, is calling on shoppers to show their support for local retailers as they join in the  Retail NI Independents’ Day on  JulyBallymena’s retail centre is gradually starting to look busier with more people willing to venture ‘downtown’ for a taste of the new normality.To be honest, it’s not perfect at the moment with queues for shops and toilet facilities causing frustration but as protocols hopefully change and the COVID threat recedes there will be a real need to back local stores and bsuinesses.And to help that cause, Council is branding Independents Day UK as a chance for local people e to show support for the independent retailers they value most in the local community.Independent business owners account for around % of the approximately , retail outlets in the UK.ies.The Mayor hopes shoppers will give their backing to the campaign and support retailers now and throughout the year.He said: “Mid and East Antrim is open for business, and I hope our community will show their support for our smaller, independent retailers as we continue to move out of the lockdown restrictions.Many of our businesses have been there to support us when we needed them.

This is entirely within the Education Minister#s remit, and to not consider alternatives as a matter of urgency is both negligent and unfair.Mr Lyttle, her Alliance colleague and education committee chairman, said Mr Weir#s refusal was surprising and unacceptable, and should be reversed.This year#s post-primary transfer tests have been delayed by two weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic.The parents of two children in Northern Ireland have won High Court permission to challenge decisions to delay the tests.Their lawyers argued last month that the decision to delay by a matter of weeks amid so much disruption to their education is unlawful.Meanwhile, a number of Catholic grammars and an integrated school have said they will not use transfer test results to admit pupils in .Belfast Related ContentEditor#s ViewpointEditor#s ViewpointOpinionEducation Minister Peter Weir was wrong to snub worried parentsApart from the NHS, education has been the public service hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

A Ulster University graduate, Shawn said that he is now planning to treat his family with his windfall.Read MoreEditor#s Viewpoint:Opinion £m winner Shawn not the only beneficiary from lotteryHe purchased some scratchcards at the end of a sht which led him to buying his winning card.It all started when I bought a couple of £ scratchcards on the Friday night, explained Shawn. I won £ on those so, as I was leaving work around .pm on Saturday evening, I bought a couple of £ scratchcards with my winnings.It was only when Shawn arrived home and was preparing to get ready for a socially distanced garden party with friends that he remembered he had the scratchcards in his jacket.He said he could not believe it when he discovered the numbers on one of the cards matched, and he had won the top prize of £m.At first I thought it must be a fake card and I checked every inch of it to make sure it was real, continued Shawn.I ran through the details with a lovely lady on the end of the phone before she said the magic words… #Congratulations, you#ve won a million pounds#, he recalled.I really couldn#t believe what I was hearing. I was still trying to process what was happening while my mum was already making plans for a new asphalt driveway at the front of the house, which they#ve been working on. Then she phoned my brother Paul in England and I texted my brother Gavin in Australia - both of whom naturally thought we were joking, he laughed.Shawn, however, was soon brought back down to earth after he received a phone call from the store assistant who had earlier sold him the winning scratchcard.The call came through and immediately I thought this was it - I#d been the victim of an elaborate prank, said Shawn. But it turned out there was just a problem with the fridge in the shop so I had to go round and fix it, knowing that I#d literally just won a million.Despite his new millionaire status, Shawn says that he will continue to work at McNicholl#s Eurospar. As well as a new driveway and shed for his mum, and treating the rest of his family, he wants to buy a Range Rover and go on a holiday abroad.Shawn said customers have been popping into the store to congratulate him since news of his win broke locally.It#s crazy, because it#s only been a matter of weeks since I was chatting to customers about Robert Fullerton from Castledawson who won £, on a scratchcard in May, he added.We were just saying how amazing it would be to win that sort of money. Now here I am, just two months later, having won a million quid. It just goes to show that anyone can win it at any time. I just feel lucky and blessed that on this occasion, it was my turn.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much.

The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Molly Elliott died on June . Molly, who lived in the Top of the Hill area of the city, was -years-old. Her sudden death has left her family and many friends heartbroken. Mollys family say they do not want her death to have been in vain, and have urged her friends and other young people to speak to others about problems they are experiencing. Addressing the congregation at Mollys funeral last week, her aunt, Lynn, asked for prayers for all those without hope. googletag.cmd.push “Help all the young people here today, help them Father to talk, to listen, to hear and to seek the help they need. “This is not the answer,you could all just look to your left, to your right, front and back, you will see mums and dads praying this is not coming to their door. “Please, please let our beautul Molly be the last,” she said. Also speaking at Mollys funeral service, Father Michael Canny said she was a person who had time for others and would chat with themthey were feeling down. “Of course, immediate and extended family were important to her,” said Father Canny. googletag.cmd.push “She also was a volunteer at Hillcrest House and involved down through the years in their summer schemes and other things. “The days ahead will be challenging, most of us will go from here but the immediate family will be left on their own to try to pick up the pieces of le again. “It won’t be easy, le will go on, le goes on, but for you le will be much, much dferent. “But at the same time I think you will be able to reflect on Molly and on the dferent rays of sunshine she brought into your lives.” Mollys uncle, Denny Elliott, said she loved giving and receiving hugs. “She was bursting with affection and would give you hugs that you felt the love flowing from her into you. They’ll now stay with us forever,” he said. “She never shut up - ‘wait til you hear’ she’d say and then you’d just listen and not get a word in edgeways. “Those one way conversations will now stay with us forever.” Mr Elliott said his niece was someone who was there for everybody. “Only last week, Mollys best friend felt a wee bit down and did the right thing, reaching out to his best friend Molly, not knowing for the last time. “Come down for a wee chat and a hug, she said. That chat will stay with him forever.” Mr Elliott said Molly loved her family deeply but they were struggling to come to terms with her sudden death. In a direct message to Mollys friends and other young people, he quoted renowned poet Walt Whitman who wrote ‘the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. “What will your verse be ” Mr Elliott asked of young people. “Let Mollys verse be this: No other young person who knew her or reads about her will ever feel the need to end their le but instead reach out all around them and share their fears, doubts and insecurities to their mothers, fathers, siblings, carers and friends and relations.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On  May, George Floyd - a black man – was surrounded by four white men in police unorms, all with guns. Three of them stood by while one literally squeezed the le out of him – all the time knowing they were being filmed. We watched this video – like many others globally - and imagined it was our son, our husband, our brother, our friend. It was traumatic. The familiarity and the horror of these images demanded that we raise our voices and demonstrate our anger and pain. But that is the US you might think - it is not like that here.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But all bodies have a responsibility to prioritise this development. googletag.cmd.push “Over the past number of years myself and Cllr Patricia have worked intensely with the owners, the local community, Iona Enterprises, Dove House Community Trust, The Executive Office , Urban Villages and Council to progress the site to development and had hoped that demolition would have taken place before now. “The residents in the immediate area have suffered for too long as this site has been allowed to fall into neglect and dereliction. “I am confident that everyone involved is committed to delivering the proposed regeneration project that we all desire. “I would urge all the stakeholders to redouble their efforts and commitments to ensure that this community gets the facilities and services that the redeveloped Meenan Park will deliver.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This week I want to highlight the plight of many small businesses across the city and tell you what you can do to help them survive. For the past  weeks many businesses have shut their doors and either furloughed staff or made them redundant. Now, however, is the time to get the economy on this Island back up and running. We cant as a society afford to stay shut any longer. There isnt the option to stay closed and until a vaccine is found. googletag.cmd.push This is just fancul thinking and would bankrupt any economy that attempted this strategy. We must learn to live with the virus within our society and shield the most vulnerable from it. The rest of us must take responsibility for our own protection and follow the guidelines set out by government. Both the British and Irish governments in fairness have risen to the challenge and supported businesses and workers for the last four months. The continuation of this support indefinitely isnt economically sustainable. The cost of the support to date has been largely borrowed by governments and will need to be repaid at some stage by raising taxes. googletag.cmd.push There is no such thing as free money from any government in the world. If you get something from government, it will most certainly will be got back by a tax.  So, lets all accept that we have suppressed the virus and now is the time to re-open our economy and get back to work as best we can in the circumstances. Now let us not forget that many of our local businesses watched in dismay as their income streams totally dried up in March. Over the last three months many have had virtually no income, but bills have still mounted up. Some got reduced rates and rents, however bills unpaid since March are waiting for them now as they open. Landlords will be looking rent again and creditors will be looking paid. The Inland Revenue who has been quiet for a while will be back looking for taxes due for last year and on account for . As these small firms re-open their doors and staff come off government furlough schemes the next few months will either make or break them. They really need our support folks so please support themyou can. Very few businesses havent been affected by this crisis and as the economy begins, the bills may come at them quicker than their customers. There could be a bloodbath in terms of bankruptciesphysical re-opening is ahead of consumer confidence. Many local businesses are opening tentatively not knowingcustomers willin the pre-Covid numbers. For some businesses consumer confidence is their biggest issue. Many customers might shun these businesses for fear of catching the virus. The fear factor is still pretty high amongst some consumer groups, but I hope this is confined just to people that fall into the highest risk of infection . For other businesses like restaurants hairdressers etc. the problem will be the new guidelines and how they effect the delivery of the service and capacity of the business. A good example of this can be seen in the recent price hikes announced by hairdressers in Dublin before they re-opened. With capacity reduced signicantly due to social distancing and the additional costs linked to cleaning hygiene etc. many had to increase prices by as much as %. I dont expect increases of this scale in Derry but I have a lot of sympathy for a business that is forced to increase their prices due to reduced capacity. Its not price gauging and has more to do with the current restrictions and capacity reduction. People shouldnt jump to social media with tales of being robbed or fleeced. Its really a case of pricing to survive for many businesses. These next few weeks will be make or break for many companies re-opening after the lockdown so I believe its our civic duty to do as much as we can to support them. What can we do  The simplest answer is get out there and spendyou can afford it. Put the keyboard down and stop buying online unless you really have to. Book a meal and get out there and enjoy a might out. By doing this you are not only supporting your local restaurant but you’re also helping to preserve jobs. Get up the town and spend a few pound, would be my advice. What we all do over the next few months can make a huge dference and could help save hundreds of jobs in the city. If we dont engage with our local businesses, they will be forced to lay people off. Go out and buy a bed for the spare room. Get that much needed haircut. Take the boyfriend out for that steak dinner. We really have to support local shops, service providers and manufacturers now more than ever. And remember, we can do all of this and stay safewe follow the rules, wear a mask and keep the proper distance. Taking holidays in Ireland or a Staycation will also help. And folks this is not me crying wolf. Huge jobs losses are already occurring across these Islands as we come out of this crisis. Intu Properties, which owns or part-owns  huge shopping centres across the UK and Spain, including the Trafford centre in Manchester, has filed for bankruptcy already last week. It will not the last business casualty of the Covid- crisis. So do your bit folks. Get back out there and spend what you can afford locally, and help keeps jobs in Derry.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. CASE STUDY KERR’S TYRES  AUTO When Covid- struck, one of Northern Ireland’s leading providers of tyres and automotive services, had just invested pound.m in a new head office and distribution centre in Antrim and cash reserves were low. googletag.cmd.push But thanks to their ability to adapt, ersy as well as the invaluable support from the UK Government, Kerr’s Tyres  Auto has been able play a vital role in servicing and keeping the province’s key workers on the road. Managing director Norman Kerr said: “The Antrim site used up our cash reserves and had a big impact on our cash flow. “Unfortunately the coronavirus kicked in three months later, when we still didn’t have a chance to build up any cash reserves that we would normally have. So it had a massive impact on ourselves. “But the problem was we had to continue trading because we supply the food sector and the white delivery van man. So our business had to continue. We had to pay suppliers, we had no choice in it.” googletag.cmd.push However thanks to a UK Government Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme loan of pound, through the Ulster Bank, as well as the furlough scheme, the family-run business was able to remain solvent and save over  jobs. Norman said: “Had we not been able to get the UK Government loan scheme, it would have had a huge impact on our business. Our business, in essence, dropped probably  per cent within the first month. Thankfully that has grown steadily back since then.  ON THE RIGHT ROAD: Norman Kerr, of Kerr’s Tyres  Auto “We also had to furlough  per cent of our staff in month one. As business picked up again and things moved forward, by month two we were probably down to  per cent. “Month three was  per cent working and we hope within the coming weeks we will have nobody left on furlough. But againit wasn’t for furlough, this would have also had a huge impact on cash flow. “Honestly, when you have  staff, it’s a big bill at the end of every month. We would have had no option but to have laid off around  staff and there was nothing we could have done about that. “So the schemes that the UK Government has introduced have been very helpful.” With  branches, including four in the Republic and seven in Northern Ireland, plus a workforce of over , the UK Government schemes also gave Norman and his team the freedom to ersy and keep some of the leading supermarkets and delivery firms up and running. He said: “We had to ersy dramatically in our business. Collection and delivery rather than customers coming to us. “We had to operate a night sht. So we put four breakdown fitters on our night sht rota. That was to cover the likes of Tesco, Asda and the white van man. “The delivery men have been working   because everything is getting delivered at home. So we found the need to have to serve them on a night sht rota.” With over  years business experience, Kerr’s also adapted to ensure Government guidelines were adhered to. Norman said: “Because we did ersication and received the UK Government help we were able to continue to do business and can look forward to the future.” ‘A real letime in this time of crisis’ CASE STUDY MADEMOISELLE MACARON Rachel Hanretty, of Mademoiselle Macaron, fell in love with macarons while living in Paris. Once Rachel ed to Edinburgh and noticed a gap in the market, she decided to set up her very own macaron business. After nine months of trading from home and going to food markets, Rachel set up her first bricks-and-mortar store. She said: “It was in the centre of Edinburgh, it had a view of the castle. It was beautul.” But since launching their online store in , and realising that they could send macarons across the country, plus the fact that they had large bookings from both wholesale and wedding customers, the bricks and mortar became unnecessary. The company, which employs eight people, lost all their wholesale customers overnight due to Coronavirus. Rachel said: “It was really scary. All the weddings, all the wholesale customers, and the bulk of our production disappeared. And then, of course, you have phone calls from people wanting to cancel future orders and refunds.  TASTY TREATS: Rachel Hanretty, below, has used the furlough scheme to keep Mademoiselle Macaron going  “We entered the cash flow situation whereby the wholesale customers stopped paying the invoices. And we’ve now got over pound, worth of overdue invoices.” But, it’s not all doom and gloom, as Mademoiselle Macaron has started to see an increase in online orders. It’s thanks to the UK Government’s furlough scheme that her business has kept afloat. Rachel said: “The furlough scheme has been a real leline in this time of crisis. I asked people to volunteer for furlough. So the people who wanted to and were happy to, they were the first ones to go.”   ‘We paid creditors and maintained relationships’ CASE STUDY THE SEREN COLLECTION With plans for a new spa at his five-star hotel, a Michelin-star chef in his restaurant and the launch of a tour operator business underway, Neil Kedward was looking forward to a good year in . But when the Covid- pandemic struck, the managing director of Wales-based The Seren Collection required urgent assistance from the UK Government’s support schemes to pay his creditors and maintain supplier relationships. Mr Kedward and his we Zoe entered the hospitality industry almost by accident in . He said: “We just happened to come home to South Wales for the weekend and stumbled across The Grove. It was a calamitous trip with lots of wrong turns and family arguments, but we found the owner in, made our offer and that was that.”  FINANCIAL AID: Neil Kedward, of The Seren Collection Neil and Zoe went on to open two restaurants in Saundersfoot and Oxwich on the back of the success of The Grove. Asthat weren’t enough to keep the team busy, he also spotted a gap in the tour operator market. Neil said: “ It struck me that there weren’t enough tour operators bringing people into the country. So we started a business called routescape, which had a hugely encouraging start, launching at World Travel Market before a big business development trip in . And then, of course, the whole project was wiped out by the virus. We lost every single booking. “The loan from the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme has allowed us to pay off all our creditors and we will be able to relaunch owing nobody any money.” Help available to companies and workers Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bernadette Radclfe, from the Brandywell, bought a ticket for a competition to win a black Lamborghini Gallardo on a whim when she saw it advertised on social media. Mrs Radclfe had just a one in , chance of winning the prize from Derry company Vogue Competitions She couldnt believe her luck when she got a call from Derry singer and entertainer Micky Doherty who had picked her name out using a computerised random number generator. Micky then paid a surprise visit to Bernadette who was celebrating with a cup of tea at her sister Siobhans house in Galliagh Park. googletag.cmd.push Shes doesnt drink, she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drive so she was celebrating with a cup of tea and a Club biscuit, laughed Micky. Anybody  would be drinking a bucket of vodka. Micky said he was delighted Mrs Radclfe had won the prize because shes a lovely person. Shes from the Lecky Road which is where my mother was from so it was very special to me. At first I didnt recognise her name because I would know her as Bernie, but then I realised that I know her and all her sisters for a long time. Shes a lovely person and a real lady. googletag.cmd.push I always say nice things happen to nice people. Earlier that day Bernie was out handing out candles of Sister Clareand I said a wee prayer to Sr Clare before I picked the winner that I would pick the person that deserved it. She works in mysterious ways. The Lamborghini was part of a three part prize draw that also included a Rolex watch which was won by Niall McDaid from Bishops Street from a pound ticket and a lawn mower which went to Patrick McDaid from Rosemount who purchased a ticket for pound. Blaine Tierney of Vogue Competitions and Vogue Car sales in Springtown has given away a large number of cars in competitions since lockdown began in March. The Lamborghini is our biggest giveaway yet, its an amazing car and it would cost pound, new, he said. Its brilliant to be able to give people le changing prizes and the majority of the prize winners have been from Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was revealed recently that just over % of all vehicles using the Pennyburn dump in Derry are from the Republic. Concern had been raised that local ratepayers were footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. Five of the councils  recycling centres reopened on May  last after being closed from March because of the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. After the recycling centres reopened, council officers noted the registration of all vehicles using them. googletag.cmd.push The information was collated from Monday, May , to Friday, May . The figures revealed that during that -day period, a total of , cars with Republic of Ireland number plates used the local dumps. The vast majority of Republic-registered vehicles used the Pennyburn recycling centre - a total of . This was just over % of the overall , vehicles which used the Pennyburn dump during this time. Eighty three vehicles with southern number plates used the Glendermott recycling centre during this period, out of a total of , visitors. There were  southern-registered cars which used the Strahans Road dump in Strabane, out of a total of , visitors. googletag.cmd.push The two other councils dumps that reopened on May  - Strathfoyle and Claudy - had no vehicles from the Republic visit them during the period from May  to May . Derry’s recycling centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal, people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free. The issue of usage of the local recycling centres was discussed yesterday at a special meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration committee. At the meeting, DUP Alderman Ryan McCready proposed that a working group be set up to look at the issue of vehicles from the Republic using the local recycling centres. This was backed by all other parties on the council apart from Sinn Fein. In a report prepared for yesterdays meeting, it was stated that additional staff would be neededthe council was to monitor vehicles using the recycling centres. The report stated: More recently Members asked that officers consider the implications of a policy that restricts access to recycling sites to those that reside within the Council area only. This would place an additional resource burden on the service in that staff will have to check the residency details of all those entering sites right across the district. Several of the sites operate with a single member of staff, who needs to supervise the disposal of materials and assist those using the site, therefore additional staff would be required at these facilities to ensure compliance.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

lsquocafe culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality.

I will be doing some readings in the autumn, including at Doirersquos th anniversary event at the Bray Literary Festival in September and Irsquom very grateful to Doire for publishing this collection and to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland who have supported the publication.In the Museum of Misremembered Things costs pound and can be purchased online from www.doirepress or from No Alibis Bookstore, Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Megalith to feature on Ulster Giants TV show  ","story":"THE imposing standing stone in the heart of Delamont Country Park outside Killyleagh features in next week in a new series of UTVrsquos Ulster Giants.The giant megalith mdash erected to mark the start of the new millennium in  mdash commands spectacular views of nearby Strangford Lough and is one of the country parkrsquos most inspiring features.Celebrating Northern Irelandrsquos rich civil engineering heritage, the UTV series sees presenterJoe Mahon travel across the country to uncover the inspiring stories behind gigantic structures and the people who created them. In this his third series, Joe s with another fascinating set of programmes celebrating the mighty achievements of the past that have transformed our daily living and reveals the cutting-edge technology that is shaping the future of our infrastructure.With the help of the experts in their respective fields, Joe reveals the stories behind some of Northern Irelandrsquos well-known landmarks and also sheds light on how civil engineering is in operation quite literally beneath our feet!Get ready to go salt mining, quarry blasting, castle roofing, engine restoring, road surfacing and flood preventing to name a few of the activities that Joe gets involved with in this series.In the opening episode which airs next Monday night at pm, Joe visits Delamont which nestles on the shores of the internationally acclaimed waterway.The country park is home to the largest monolith or standing stone in the UK and Ireland, with the signicant landmark standing  metres tall and weighing in at almost  tonnes.Ancient civilisations throughout the world marked important occasions and cosmic events by erecting megaliths, often in circles or other formations, but sometimes as free-standing monoliths. There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on. With all the fresh air and seeing the stars at night, when you wake up, all you can see is the ground hundreds of metres below you, itrsquos just amazing.Paul now lives in Chamonix at the foot of Mont Blanc in the French Alps with his English we, Ellie, and toddler son Luca. Luca was only weeks old when his parents climbed Slieve Donard on a trip home with him safely tucked inside a sling on his fatherrsquos chest.Hersquos enjoying his time lsquorestingrsquo from his day job of guiding people on challenging climbs of the Alpsrsquo highest peaks of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Eiger to spend time with his son.Depending on the mountain, he guides either one or two people up the peaks and safely down again.Paul explained: ldquoThe people who hire me are time poor but money rich. They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb. Now that would be really rewarding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"October next National League date for Down  ","story":"IT has been over  weeks now since Down last played a league game mdash against Offaly on March .The next league game is due to take place against Leitrim on Saturday, October , or the following day,the Covid- virus continues to fizzle out.

The proposal from Olympian Homes is highly likely to succeed because the failings of our planning system have allowed the developer and the council to maintain the legal fiction that the building has no heritage value.This position isn’t even remotely credible, given Havelock House’s integral role in the birth of Northern Ireland’s television industry, its indelible association with legendary local series such as Teatime with Tommy, Romper Room, Good Evening Ulster and Kelly and its status as the last surviving small station from the pioneering days of UK television.Features such as the original UTV studio, designed by local architect Brian Hewitt, are literally the nation’s last built record of the earliest days of television in regions such as Northern Ireland.The Queen meets UTV broadcasters including Paul Clarke during her visit to Havelock House as they launch their new HD station there in . Pic Colm Lenaghan PacemakerBut, despite its clear historical importance, nobody seems willing to protect a building which occupies a prime development site.There are two forms of protection available: full listed status, which can only be granted by the Department for Communities , and heritage asset status, which could be granted by Belfast City Council.The DfC has decided that Havelock House does not meet the criteria for a listing survey, the first step in the listing process. It reached this decision on the basis of a brief inspection of the building by officials in . Studio  inside Havelock House in the s with guests including Frank Carson, Gloria Hunnord and Rev David BurkeThe rationale behind its decision was never fully recorded. The fragments available suggest that the officials were not familiar with television architecture, leading them to make several inadvertent but decisive misinterpretations. The DfC has been aware of this issue for  months yet has remains unwilling to review its decision.Eventhere were a review, it is unlikely the DfC’s decision will change because its listing criteria are dominated by aesthetic considerations. This is exemplied by the protected status of the BBC’s Broadcasting House, which is an attractive building devoid of internal historical fabric. Dr Ken Grfin, a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster TelevisionBy contrast, the DfC seems relaxed about the possible loss of Havelock House, a less attractive building with unique historical architecture.The absence of listed building status isn’t necessarily an issue because local authorities can designate heritage assets, buildings which don’t meet the national listing criteria but should still be protected on cultural and historical grounds.This author has been unable to find any instance where Belfast City Council has used this power. It’s also unlikely to do so in the future because its current draft development plan indicates that only listed buildings qualy as heritage assets, which defeats the purpose of that designation.The authorities’ inaction has not just left Havelock House exposed to demolition but it has reduced the public’s ability to scrutinise Olympian Homes’ demolition proposal. Without protection, the developers and Belfast’s planners have been able to maintain the fiction that Havelock House is a building devoid of historical value. This has allowed Olympian to submit a heritage statement which does not consider the historical or cultural impact of the building’s demolition. This is entirely legitimate as such statements are not required to disclose a development’s impact on unprotected structures.It has also allowed the developers to avoid the type of public consultation normally triggered by planning applications which entail the demolition of historically signicant buildings. Due to Havelock House’s unlisted status, Olympian could conduct a minimalistic consultation. It is impossible to assess the nature of Olympian’s consultation because the developer seems to have omitted its consultation report from its planning application. But it seems to have been poorly advertised – this author only became aware of the proposal by accident while, despite the development’s size, only a handful of objections have been received by the council to date.The developer’s decision to name its development ‘Havelock House’ in spite of the intended demolition of the eponymous building also seems to have sown confusion. My personal experience is that many people assume that the historic television station would be retained as part of the development.The affair of Havelock House might seem extraordinary but the sad fact is that such scenarios are not uncommon in our planning system.This has had a corrosive impact on public faith in the planning system: last month, a survey by Queen’s University found that % of people believe that Northern Ireland’s planning system does not serve the public interest.Barring a miracle, events on Belfast’s Ormeau Road are likely to only reinforce this view.• Dr Ken Grfin is a television historian and archivist whose doctoral thesis was on the history of Ulster Television.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh

who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south end of the Esplanade we have installed a training room which is ideal for providing training in a warm, well-lit and stable room, prior to practicing on often rough seas in the leboats.ldquoMy favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the success of the station, current leboat operations manager, Jason Dunlop said ldquoI am incredibly proud to celebrate the stationrsquos -year anniversary.ldquoIt is testament to the community of Penarth who have supported the leboats by providing volunteers, funds, and ongoing support.ldquoThis community effort over the past  years has saved  lives, we have rescued or aided  people and our leboats have launched on service  times.ldquoHundreds of volunteers have supported the RNLI and the station in this time.ldquoI would like to express my thanks to them all and their families.He added: ldquoIt makes no dferencethe role people have played is to crew the boats, to assist launch on shore, provide community safety advice, run our shops or fundraise, everyone plays a vital role in saving lives.ldquoThe RNLI is funded by donations and receives no government funding, soyou are a fundraiser, a member of our shop team, a local business who supports us or a member of the community who has donated or raised funds you have help us to save lives.ldquoWe are all one leboat crew and we are part of the community of Penarth.ldquoThe RNLI is built of the vision that ldquowith courage, nothing is impossible.ldquoI believe that the community of Penarth is a living example of this vision.ldquoAs we say in the RNLI, ldquofair winds and following seas.Leboat spokesman, Andy Berry has asked members the community to send stories and short video messages to awb.safety@gmail where they can be shared online.He said: ldquoMaybe yoursquove been directly involved in a rescue, or perhaps wersquove helped your friends and family  Or maybe you just have a nice story too share about our work or want to wish us well.ldquoWe would love to hear from you.The RNLI, like many charities is facing a funding crisis through the covid- crisis.Penarth RNLI has set up a JustGiving page to help raise monies to mark the th anniversary, with a target of pound.The Penarth Nationwide branch has

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

balances.\"Itrsquos ironic in some ways as when we were setting the budget for this financial year, some of our members wanted to use them and reduce the council tax levels.\"If we had done that, we would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a payment holiday and wersquove also issued a considerable number of grants to businesses.\"We have paid out more than pound million in grants to businesses, which we will get back from Welsh Government, but therersquos no guarantee that all businesses will survive this.\"Wersquove also granted some rent relief for businesses who operate in council-owned premises for the first three months of this year, but who knows how long this pandemic will last \"Whilst Welsh Government has been able to provide some additional funding to local authorities, they have not got a bottomless pit of money either.\"Wersquore also paying out grants to charities and amateur sports clubs.\"\"Covid- is also having an effect on the council tax relief scheme,\" Cllr Moore said. \"The Government currently provides money to help people on low incomes claim a discount.\"The level of funding was set prior to this pandemic and the call on this funding is already increasing.\"This may not be sustainable and we may have to fund it ourselves.\"Applications for that fund have gone up immensely since the covid- situation.\"The Welsh Local Government Association believe there could be a spending increase of around pound million across Wales.\"For us that would equate to around pound,.\"At the moment, we can code spending against the pandemic and make claims to Welsh Government, as is every other local authority in Wales.\"But I emphasise, therersquos no guarantee that it is going to go on forever.\"The virus has also seen internal costs increase in certain areas.\"We needed to upgrade our IT facilities and expenditure on waste and recycling is also rising.\"Wersquove had to increase our investment in IT because a considerable number of staff are now working from home.\"Originally, we thought we were going to get all of that back, but now wersquove been told wersquore only going to get  per cent.\"Thatrsquos an expense we didnrsquot anticipate and itrsquos an expense we will have to absorb.\"The other added expenditure is due to people being out of work or furloughed.\"We have seen increases in applications for universal credit and thatrsquos going to have an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is having a massive impact on the council and the community.\"The exact extent of this impact is very dficult to estimate, but we will continue to support the community until it is defeated.\"He added:

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbcddecf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbaeedfcebefdffbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
