However, the mechanisms underpinning such changes are unclear.The scientists at the APC Microbiome Ireland, however, have shown that modifying the gut microbes by diet can lessen inflammation in the brain of middle-aged male mice and may positively influence brain ageing and function.There is growing evidence microbes in the gut can play a key role in regulating brain functions, particularly emotional processing and behaviour. Prebiotics are non-digestible fibres that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the intestines.Inulin is one such prebiotic found in a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs, including wheat, onions, bananas, leeks, artichokes, asparagus and chicory that is attracting their attention.“We wanted to see whether an inulin-enriched diet that can modulate the composition of the microbes in the gut could also improve brain health and wellbeing,” said Prof John Cryan, who led the research.“The community of microbes in the gut changes with ageing. Many studies in ageing focus on very old animals and this may be too late to reverse the age-associated changes. We chose middle-age in the hope that we could promote healthy ageing,” he explained.Their findings suggests prebiotic dietary fibres could be developed as a new strategy to promote healthy ageing by protecting brain function and prevent the adverse effects of age-related neuroinflammation including dementia. “Perhaps in the future new dietary regimes rather than fancy cars or motorbikes is what is needed for that midlife crisis,” Prof Cryan added.“Our research shows that a diet supplemented with prebiotics reversed microglia activation in the middle-aged mouse brain towards young adult levels. Moreover, this reversing effect was observed in a key region of the brain which regulates learning and memory in the hippocampus,” Dr Marcus Boehme said.“Microglia are the major immune cells in the brain and have shown to be a key player in neuropsychological and neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, microglia play a crucial role in brain plasticity and cognition.”Prof Ted Dinan and Dr Harriet Schellekens also contributed to the study published in the leading journal Molecular Psychiatry."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Ex-mayor of Kilkenny says opposition was not an issue of religion but one of traffic managementT\u0026aacutenaiste sees obligation for Tories and Labour to find middle ground positionAustrian city regularly ranked as the most liveable city in the worldMan in his 50s arrested as Army bomb experts deal with packageFr Michael Guckian was killed in a Co Roscommon hit-and-run incident last weekendOrder is apparently aimed at banning Huawei\u0026rsquos equipment from US networks\u0026lsquoIt has real consequences for people\u0026rsquos well-being and mental health,\u0026rsquo Professor saysCommittee hears replacing oil and gas boilers with heat pumps is \u0026lsquonot rocket science\u0026rsquoUCC researchers find prebiotic compound promotes growth of beneficial microbes in gutSecretary general of health department to outline plans to increase oversight of projectFine Gael candidate suggests giving religious groups greater access to EU institutionsMinister calls on professionals to continue providing service amid \u0026lsquochill effect\u0026rsquo warningsWith livestock being phased out, changes in how food is produced are set to be dramaticArguing against the referendum could result in being pilloried or dismissed in modern IrelandNorthern Ireland European candidates make their pitches amid cows, ploughs and plenty of wows"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3894301.1558006192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"rejection of plan for kilkenny mosque crushingly disappointing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Hebron Industiral Estate on the outskirts of Kilkenny City, where the proposed mosque was to be built. Photograph: Google MapsThe proposal by the Kilkenny Islamic Trust for a mosque and Islamic centre at the Hebron Industrial Estate on the edge of the city was granted planning permission last year by Kilkenny County Council .However, a number of appeals were lodged with the board and a decision was made this week to overturn the council’s decision. The proposed development included a mosque, a two-storey community building, two guest apartments, two two-storey four-bedroom semi-detached houses, classrooms, a café and a halal shop.The plan caused controversy last year and there were angry scenes at a public meeting held to provide information to local people.An Bord Pleanála said it decided to overturn the planning permission because of the proposed development’s location and scale. It said the development would have been “contrary” to the Hebron Road design strategy of 2017 and would “seriously injure” the amenity of adjoining properties and would be contrary to the proper planning and development of the area.Imam Nadure said that the Muslim community in Kilkenny just wanted a place of worship. They have been renting premises for the past 11-12 years.“Our community is growing, we have been paying rent a long time. It is high time we have our own Islamic centre. We wanted to start the process of moving to our own place.”He said that when the planning process commenced there was much misinformation with false claims that there would be a call to prayer, that property prices in the area would drop. “These were meant to generate fear.”The Imam added that a public meeting held to allay local fears had been “brutal and harsh.”The Islamic community will now address the points raised in the Bord Pleanála inspector’s report to see what will be the next step.“This whole process has taken a lot of time and resources. The response is something very painful in the heart.”He described as “totally insensitive” a comment by local election candidate Michael McGrath who described the decision as “better than an All-Ireland victory”.“We are absolutely peaceful, very kind. Seventy per cent of the doctors in the hospital here are Muslim. We just want a a place to worship.“Most of our children were born here, they go to school here. Is it too much to ask for a place to worship?”‘Not about religion’ A former mayor of Kilkenny said that opposition to the planned mosque and Islamic centre was not an issue of religion, but one of traffic management.Marie Fitzpatrick, a resident of Bishop Birch Place, which is adjacent to Hebron Industrial Estate, told radio station KCLR that local people are being dictated to and not consulted by the executive of Kilkenny County Council.She said that residents of Bishop Birch Place had been seeking a road out of the area for some time and 10 years ago were promised ramps. “We seem to be the forgotten people.“It’s not about religion. It’s about traffic management. In the afternoons from 3.30pm to 6.30pm it is impossible to get out on the road. Then the congestion leads into the city.”The former Labour councillor said that factories in the area are not causing a problem, “it’s the traffic on Hebron road. It’s bad on a normal day, but on match days it is chaotic.”She anticipates that plans for a funeral parlour and a hotel will also meet opposition for the same reasons.“We’re being dictated to, not consulted by an executive. Local councillors are not coming in to talk to us, to experience what’s happening.“They should be coming in to talk to us, we’re the experts. We’ve been here for more than 40 years, surely to God we should have a say on developments in our own area.” Imam Nadure told the same radio station that worshippers would not contribute to traffic problems as they come to prayer five times a day for only 10 to 15 minutes. He pointed out that a nearby supermarket has a lot of customers and that on match days in nearby Nowlan Park that is when traffic problems are at their worst. “We will not be causing traffic problems.”He said that the board of trustees of his community is awaiting the letter from An Bord Pleanála and he does not yet know the rationale behind the decision to reverse the county council’s planning permission.“Everybody is in suspense. There is a gloomy cloud over us today. We will figure out the merits of the case. We really want a place of worship. We have visited every site in Kilkenny. We just want to build in Kilkenny.”"},{"url":null,"title":"local","story":"Total of 89 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTwo weeks before elections 50 visitors enjoy \u0026lsquoan evening of refreshments, food and music\u0026rsquoTotal of 150 candidates running in 63-seat constituencyTotal of 85 candidates running in 37-seat constituencyTotal of 107 candidates running in 55-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 79 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 35 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 36 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 63 candidates running in 30-seat constituencyTotal of 60 candidates running in 29-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 32 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 44 candidates running in 24-seat constituencyTotal of 90 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 33-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 39-seat constituencyTotal of 47 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 82 candidates running in 31-seat constituencyTotal of 51 candidates running in 28-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituency31 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyBreakdown of latest  poll numbers indicates growing support for both parties in DublinMore than 500 female candidates are contesting the local elections, many of them under 35Gap in backing for Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil smallest in 2\u0026frac12 years while Sinn F\u0026eacutein also slipsBad news for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar whose personal satisfaction rating continues to fallVoters who care about the right to life must send a message to smug pro-choice partiesCourt records show Nial Ring has been defendant in 16 sets of High Court proceedings since 2004Almost 2,000 candidates will contest 949 seats in 31 city and county councilsCandidate \u0026lsquoconfused\u0026rsquo by party statement after campaigning throughout review processA significant portion of the electorate is making a plea for a move from polarised to a more accommodating form of politicsGreens and People Before Profit also make gains in local electionsKisyombe\u0026rsquos candidacy sparked controversy following backstory inconsistenciesConservatives lose more than 1,100 seats in local elections as Labour loses more than 100 seatsDUP\u0026rsquos first openly gay candidate elected to Newtownabbey Borough CouncilIrreverent campaign asked people to vote all the way down the ballot in PR-STV electionTalks designed to restore devolution set to begin next Tuesday after Thursday\u0026rsquos pollAlison Bennington is party candidate for the Glengormley urban area of Newtownabbey Borough CouncilParty has launched 111 candidates for the local elections, and three candidates for the European electionsExtended licensing hours for serving alcohol also considered as part of local election planVoters outside the capital must use manual processPosters are an important part of our electoral and democratic process, says KinsellaPoliticians risk \u0026euro150 fine per early election posterThe upcoming local and European elections are powerful platforms for the marginalised to make their voices heardCommittee says message to local and European candidates had been \u0026lsquomisunderstood\u0026rsquoBusConnects reforms would create 230km of bus lanes along 16 traffic corridorsWe need to establish why more immigrants don\u0026rsquot participate in politics, says one candidateCouncillor-migrant internship scheme seeks to encourage greater migrant involvementInstagram helps politicians present a more rounded image.

Photograph: UK ParliamentJessica TaylorPA WireTheresa May will meet senior Conservative backbenchers on Thursday to discuss a timetable for her resignation as hopes of passing her Brexit deal received a fresh blow.Labour said it would not support the government in a key vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill next month without further concessions on the prime minister’s Brexit deal.Mrs May’s spokesman said on Wednesday that the government planned to give the bill its second reading, which must be approved by a majority of MPs, in the week beginning June 3rd. A number of Conservative eurosceptics have promised to vote against the bill and the DUP’s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said his party will not vote for it as long as the withdrawal agreement remains unchanged.Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said Labour would not support the bill at its second reading unless it had reached an agreement with the government on the Brexit deal.“Without an agreement and real compromise and movement by the government out of these talks, we’re talking about a Withdrawal Agreement Bill that’s based on the same botched Brexit deal that has been rejected three times already by Parliament,” he said.When Mrs May meets the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee on Thursday, she is expected to outline a “roadmap” for her departure from Downing Street. She has already promised to step down as soon as her Brexit deal is approved but she is under pressure to name a departure date regardless of the fate of her Brexit deal.Potential renegeTalks between the government and Labour continued at official level on Wednesday but Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said that there remained gaps between their positions and they have reached no agreement. He said Labour feared that if Mrs May resigns within the next few weeks, her successor as Conservative leader could renege on any deal.“Jeremy made clear and the shadow cabinet’s made clear that we have serious concerns about negotiating with a government that is in a process of disintegration and what has been said about what might happen if a new Tory leadership is in charge and as we all know most of those potential alternative leaders have made clear that they don’t support this process, they don’t support the content of what has been discussed and they want to overturn it,” the spokesman said.There are a number of different entrenchment mechanisms and we’ve discussed them. The government has engaged seriously in those issues and there are a huge range of different options but obviously the more the possible overturning or withdrawal of support for anything that might be agreed becomes a reality, the more serious the entrenchment mechanisms need to be.”The prime minister’s spokesman said the government was talking to the DUP and other parties as well as Labour in an effort to find a majority for the bill.“We’re having lots of discussions across the House, with colleagues, with confidence and supply partners, with the opposition as you’ve seen. That work will continue as we strive to build a sustainable majority for this Bill. The imperative for passing it is I think entirely clear, which is that if we can get this legislation through then we will be able to give effect to the clearly expressed view of the British people in the referendum to leave the European Union, ” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Rudolf Taschner, an ÖVP MP, said it was intended to “free girls from submission”.But Mr Kurz’s coalition partners in the far-Right Freedom Party (FPÖ) were more confrontational.  Wendelin Mölzer, the party’s education spokesman, said it was intended as a signal “against political Islam”.The government of chancellor Sebastian Kurz has come under fire over the new lawThe new law is specifically worded so that it does not apply to the yarmulke skullcaps worn by Jewish boys or to the patka head coverings used by Sikh boys instead of a turban. Protective head coverings against rain and snow in winter are also exempt.The Islamic Religious Community in Austria (IGGÖ) described the new law as “destructive” and vowed to challenge it in the courts.It claimed the law was a political stunt that will only affect a “minuscule number” of girls. In traditional Muslim communities, girls start wearing headscarves when they reach puberty, but the practice is not widespread in Austria.The opposition Social Democrat Party (SPÖ) accused the government of seeking cheap headlines instead of addressing the country’s integration problems.Mr Kurz’s government introduced a ban on burkas and other full-face coverings in 2017 but it was widely ridiculed after it emerged that those stopped by police under the measure included a man dressed in a comedy shark costume and a woman who had wrapped her scarf around her face against the cold.\u0026#39Flying vehicles\u0026#39 could hit Paris \u0026#39within five years\u0026#39 says French capital\u0026#39s public transport operatorSheffield United funded by £3m loan from Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s family, court hearsUS military build up \u0026#39sparked by Iran loading missiles onto small boats\u0026#39 in Persian GulfComment: After Brexit, our aid must come with strings attached  Anders and Anne Povlsen say thank you for messages of sympathy after losing three children in Sri Lanka attacksJean-Claude Juncker says £350m bus slogan was a lie as deputy calls Brexit Britain \u0026#39Game of Thrones on steroids\u0026#39Comment: The government was absolutely right to reject this flawed definition of IslamophobiaComment: MPs have no time to waste — Theresa May is destroying the Tory party and needs to goQuarter of a million fans sign petition to remake Game of Thrones series 8Prosecutions hit record 50 year low - as crime rises, official figures revealLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s royal wedding: who are the soon-to-be married couple?Harry and Meghan forced to move out of Cotswolds home due to intrusive photographs of hideaway, court hearsEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Philippines withdraws top diplomats from Canada in row over rubbish containersOn the Brexit Party campaign trail with Nigel FarageEuropean elections polls latest: Brexit Party forecast to win majority of UK seats Jeff Koons\u0026#39 Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist with £71m saleThe MEP candidates to watch in the European electionsThe Brexit Party: What do they stand for, and who are the MEP candidates running for election? We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government absolutely right reject flawed definition islamophobia","story":"Adopting the term would impede counter-terror efforts and have chilling effects on free speech I was delighted to learn that the government had rejected the definition of Islamophobia created by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on British Muslisms.

We apologise to the Duke and Duchess for the distress we have  caused. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said Harry acknowledges and welcomes the  formal apology from Splash News and Picture Agency. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39Flying vehicles\u0026#39 could hit Paris \u0026#39within five years\u0026#39 says French capital\u0026#39s public transport operatorSheffield United funded by £3m loan from Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s family, court hearsUS military build up \u0026#39sparked by Iran loading missiles onto small boats\u0026#39 in Persian GulfAustria votes to ban Muslim girls from wearing headscarves to schoolComment: After Brexit, our aid must come with strings attached  Anders and Anne Povlsen say thank you for messages of sympathy after losing three children in Sri Lanka attacksJean-Claude Juncker says £350m bus slogan was a lie as deputy calls Brexit Britain \u0026#39Game of Thrones on steroids\u0026#39Comment: The government was absolutely right to reject this flawed definition of IslamophobiaComment: MPs have no time to waste — Theresa May is destroying the Tory party and needs to goQuarter of a million fans sign petition to remake Game of Thrones series 8Prosecutions hit record 50 year low -

One photograph has been declassified and could be released to the public.  Meanwhile, former US officials and European allies expressed skepticism over the US decision to pull diplomats out of the American embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Iraqi Kurdistan in response to threats from Shia militias. Letters from Jerusalem RHSAll “non-emergency” US diplomats are being withdrawn, leaving only a skeleton staff behind. Brett McGurk, a former diplomat who led the US political effort against the Islamic State (Isil), said it was the first time that such a dramatic draw down of American diplomats had taken place.  “Even when Isil was bearing down on Baghdad in 2014, the US did not trigger ordered departure in light of its serious repercussions,” he said on Twitter. The UK has not followed the American lead and British diplomats remain at their posts in both Baghdad and in Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish region. Earlier this week, Major General Chris Ghika, a UK officer, said there was no evidence of an increased threat from Iran in either Iraq or Syria. His comments were flatly contradicted by the US military in a rare public sign of discord between the allied armies. The US so far appears to have failed to convince the UK or other European allies of an urgent threat from Iran. Jeremy Hunt and other European foreign ministers have instead sounded the alarm that the US and Iran could stumble into a war neither side wants.  Saudi Arabia, Iran’s main rival in the region, meanwhile said it held Iran responsible for a drone attack against Saudi oil facilities carried out by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The drones struck two oil pumping stations on Tuesday and Saudi-led forces responded with a wave of airstrikes on the Yemeni capital on Thursday. The Houthis claimed the strikes killed six civilians, including four children.Saudi Arabia accuses the Houthis of being Iranian proxies. “The Houthis are inisible part of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and subject to the IRGC’s orders,” said Adel Al-Jubeir, a Saudi foreign minister. The Houthis claimed responsibility for the drone attack but deny that they are under control of Iran. Most analysts believe Iran provides some funding and arms to the Houthis but they are largely independent. \u0026#39Flying vehicles\u0026#39 could hit Paris \u0026#39within five years\u0026#39 says French capital\u0026#39s public transport operatorSheffield United funded by £3m loan from Osama bin Laden\u0026#39s family, court hearsAustria votes to ban Muslim girls from wearing headscarves to schoolComment: After Brexit, our aid must come with strings attached  Anders and Anne Povlsen say thank you for messages of sympathy after losing three children in Sri Lanka attacksJean-Claude Juncker says £350m bus slogan was a lie as deputy calls Brexit Britain \u0026#39Game of Thrones on steroids\u0026#39Comment: The government was absolutely right to reject this flawed definition of IslamophobiaComment: MPs have no time to waste — Theresa May is destroying the Tory party and needs to goQuarter of a million fans sign petition to remake Game of Thrones series 8Prosecutions hit record 50 year low - as crime rises, official figures revealLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s royal wedding: who are the soon-to-be married couple?Harry and Meghan forced to move out of Cotswolds home due to intrusive photographs of hideaway, court hearsEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Philippines withdraws top diplomats from Canada in row over rubbish containersOn the Brexit Party campaign trail with Nigel FarageEuropean elections polls latest: Brexit Party forecast to win majority of UK seats Jeff Koons\u0026#39 Rabbit sculpture breaks record for living artist with £71m saleThe MEP candidates to watch in the European electionsThe Brexit Party: What do they stand for, and who are the MEP candidates running for election? We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/06/16/broadband.jpg","title":"broadband companies tell customers cheaper deals ofcom ruling","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

But, given the scale of the loyalty penalty, this won\u0027t be enough to solve the problem.“The Competition and Markets Authority was clear in its response to our super-complaint that regulators must report on their progress by June. We look forward to hearing about the concrete actions Ofcom will take to end this systematic scam.”Which? head of home products and services Natalie Hitchins said: “Until now many customers have found themselves paying over the odds for staying with their provider after their initial contract has ended - so notifying people in advance that they may be about to be hit by these poor-value rolling tariffs is a step in the right direction.“Providers should be fighting hard to show that they deserve to hold on to their customers, not hitting them with an unexpected price hike the minute their contract is up.”Digital Minister Margot James said: “For too long, large numbers of loyal consumers have been paying too much for their telecoms services, which is why we\u0027ve also strengthened Ofcom\u0027s powers to create a fairer and more transparent system.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The\u0026nbsppay claim seriously complicates them\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentAsda faces an equal pay claim from thousands of shop workersAsda and Walmart executives have doubtless spent the day fielding calls from investment bankers keen to get involved in what could turn in to a very chunky flotation.It follows Walmart International chief executive Judith McKenna telling a meeting of 1,200 managers that an IPO of Britain’s number three supermarket chain - soon to be number two given the way it’s performing vis a vis Sainsbury’s - is being “seriously considered”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, McKenna reportedly warned that the path to such a share offering, in the wake of failure of the American retail giant’s attempt to merged the business with Sainsbury’s, could take years. Those bankers should take note.\u0026nbspAsda could be floated on stock market after failed Sainsbury\u0027s mergerChickens stepped on and left convulsing at Nando\u0027s and Asda supplier Asda has been in the midst of an impressive revival, having posted seven consecutive quarters of growth. Its owner, which has its eyes on sexier, faster growing markets, would probably like to use this to drum up interest from a bidder who might be willing to pay a premium. But there’s been a conspicuous lack of interest following the Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority’s decision to block the merger.The UK’s competitive grocery sector, combined with the Brexit related uncertainties stoked by a dismal government and the grim political climate that’s emerged from them, make it a less than attractive market to enter right now.\u0026nbspBut Asda also has another issue to grapple with: An equal pay claim involving thousands of GMB members that is back in court in Manchester this week.\u0026nbspAt issue is the difference in pay rates offered to the largely female staff working in its stores when compared to those enjoyed by warehouse workers, who are predominantly male.\u0026nbspThe claim holds that their jobs are of comparable value\u0026nbspand so the same should be true of their wages. Law firm Leigh Day, which is litigating the case, has to date been clocking up victories at a rate even Manchester City might envy.\u0026nbspThe dispute didn’t generate a lot of attention when the merger still looked like a runner and perhaps it should have. The costs could be astronomical if Asda’s workers take it all the way and find the back of the net. They’d be more than enough to put any talk about an IPO on indefinite hold.\u0026nbspThe GMB has sought a meeting with Walmart bosses to discuss the potential flotation\u0026nbspand the group\u0027s plans for the business.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Let’s get down to business. Making their debut at Eurovision, Serbia later romped home as champions with this high-drama ballad. In an era when extravagance had well and truly taken hold, the staging was notably bare. The orchestra, the belting, the key changes, and the five backing singers dressed as a cross between beauty queens and security guards all make this feel like the climax of a modern opera. Has Eurovision ever seen anything like it, before or since? Finland’s first win after 45 years of participating came at the hands of a heavy metal band dressed in monster costumes – but this ranking is not based on novelty alone. Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.Let’s get down to business. Making their debut at Eurovision, Serbia later romped home as champions with this high-drama ballad.

Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.Eurovision’s notoriously confusing douze points\u0026nbspvoting system was introduced in 1975 before being\u0026nbspoverhauled in 2016.Public votes will make up 50 per cent\u0026nbspof the total vote, with the other half determined by a professional jury in each participating country.After voting has closed, a national spokesperson from each country\u0026nbspwill present the points of their jury.

The country has won Eurovision four times, with Dana International in 1998 remaining one of the most popular.How does the voting process for Eurovision work?Eurovision used to be judged by a collection of juries before being opened to the public for a phone vote. However, it was claimed that several countries were just voting for their friends and closest neighbours, which prompted the introduction of a new system.Iceland’s Hatari: ‘We’re the pink elephant in the room at Eurovision’The juries from each country (made up of five music industry professionals) award 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 points to their favourite songs, and reveal those jury scores through their national spokesperson. Viewers from each country can also vote via phone or SMS, awarding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 points to their favourite songs. Once public voting has closed, the results from each country are combined to give one overall Eurovision viewer score per song.Viewers in all the competing countries – including those who were knocked out in the semi-finals – can vote up to 20 times for the songs of their choice, but not for their own country. The country with the highest number of votes wins the competition and gets to host it the next year.Who is performing for the interval at the Eurovision final this year?Madonna is set to take the stage after the competitors have performed, which has already caused controversy due to the ongoing artists boycott in support of Palestine.\u0026nbspLior Suchard, Israel’s answer to Derren Brown, will also perform.How do you vote in the Eurovision Song Contest?You can vote by telephone. Here are the official BBC guidelines for UK voters:“After all countries have performed, viewers will be invited to vote for their favourite acts. Voting is by telephone only. Voters in the UK can choose either to call from their landline using the long (11-digit) number for the country of their choice or from their mobile phones using the shortcode (7-digit) number for the country of their choice.“Please note that callers from the Channel Islands and Isle of Man should call from their landlines using the long (11-digit) number to avoid higher mobile charges, as the short (7-digit) numbers are not available in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man for reasons outside of the BBC’s control.”The numbers to be used will be given during the programmes.Created with Sketch.The weirdest Eurovision outfits of all time Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lordi made history in 2006 by becoming the first hard rock act and Finnish artist to win the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006 with the song \u0027Hard Rock Hallelujah\u0027.In 2007, Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko represented Ukraine at the Eurovision Song Contest as his drag stage persona Verka Serduchka, finishing in second place.Pop duo Jedward, who became famous after appearing on the sixth series of The X Factor, represented Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2012, having previously represented the country at the competition the year before.The Eurovision Song Contest in 2016 opened with a fashion show that saw models donning unusual costumes made from what appeared to be toilet paper strut down the catwalk.Six members from the band \u0027Buranovskiye Babushki\u0027 represented Russia at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010 while wearing embroidered clothing handed down from generations of Udmurt women.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company is known for its passionate community of supporters, who were in evidence at simultaneous live launch events in London, New York and Bangalore, which all sold out quickly.OnePlus habitually releases one phone in the spring and another in the autumn. Last year, the company launched the OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T across the year. Today, though, two new phones were revealed, the OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro.CEO Pete Lau, live on stage in London, said that the phone he was revealing was the closest the company has come to the perfect product.It’s certainly a headline-grabber and a pretty large handset: the display measures 6.67 inches, almost 0.2 inches more than the largest iPhone, the iPhone XS Max.But where the iPhone has a camera unit that cuts a notch out of the top area of the display, here the phone is all-screen, no camera. More than 93 per cent of the phone’s front is screen. Unlike many all-screen phones, the display does not end abruptly above a big chin at the bottom, even if the tiny bezel is not quite even all the way around.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Samsung will cancel orders of its Galaxy Fold phone at the end of May if the phone is not then ready for sale.

When needed, the front-facing camera rises up out of the body of the handset, takes its photo as required, and slides back out of view. It’s a smooth movement completed in 0.53 seconds and tested to do so 300,000 times, that is 150 times a day for 5.5 years.Additionally, if you drop the phone with the camera protruding, it automatically senses it is falling and retracts the camera safely. (I have tried this a few times and it has worked every time,\u0026nbspeven if it was unsettling to do.)The camera sits a little off-centre, which is surprising at first but quickly becomes familiar.The result is a phone that looks astonishing: nothing but screen and strikingly high-resolution (516 pixels per inch). The glass has gently pillowed edges which mean the phone, though certainly large, is still comfortable in the hand. The fast refresh rated (90Hz) aims to deliver a smooth result, even when gaming or watching fast-moving video. The curved edges also mean notifications can be displayed as a moving light on the screen edge, visible from a distance across the room.It can display HDR content, both in the basic HDR10 version and the newer HDR10+ format – something very few other phone screens can manage.The OnePlus 7 Pro has Gorilla Glass front and back but the glass back is not used to introduce wireless charging, something the company has eschewed in the past. Although it says it hasn’t shunned the increasingly popular technology, but instead it seems to value the faster recharge that wired charging allows.Several times, OnePlus spokespeople talked about the ultra-slim profile of the phone, so perhaps the wireless charging coil would have fattened it up too much.The new, powerful charger in the box will deliver a zero to 50 per cent charge in 20 minutes.The phone comes in three colours, Mirror Grey, a shiny near-black finish, Nebula Blue which is more matte and highly colourful (and a colour inspired by the universe, we were told), and an elegant light colour called Almond.Screen unlock is done via a fingerprint sensor buried in the display. The last phone, the OnePlus 6T, also had this and it’s pretty cool. Touch your thumb on the thumbprint icon onscreen and an electric fizzing animation appears, letting you in faster than before.Cameras are always key elements on smartphones and here the main camera is a 48-megapixel sensor at a larger size than last year. Pixel binning, where adjacent photosites are combined to let more light in more accurately, aims to help create better photos.There are two other rear cameras, a telephoto lens which offers 3x the zoom of the main unit, with eight-megapixel resolution and an ultra-wide lens which has a 0.6x zoom comparted to the regular lens. That’s a 16-megapixel sensor. These cameras are a big step up from last year’s phones.OnePlus boss Pete Lau explains why 5G phones are the futureOnePlus 7 leak reveals pop-up camera and massive screenThe front camera, by the way, the one that peeps up and back again, has a 16-megapixel resolution.The processor and active memory on the OnePlus 7 are also designed for speed. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Pro is leading-edge and is matched by up to 12GB of RAM.OnePlus is known for delivering high-end specifications at mid-range prices. The rumour was that this policy might run out this time. In fact, the price is pretty keen: from £649, rising to £799 with the 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage capacity. Apart from the almond colour, which is on sale in June, other versions of the OnePlus 7 Pro are instore from next Tuesday, 21 May.OnePlus also announced something called Zen Mode that encourages you to take a break from your phone: launch the app and the OnePlus 7 Pro can only do two things, use your camera and make emergency phone calls, for the next 20 minutes. Once started, you can’t change your mind, you just have to wait. I really like the sound of this, though I wonder how much I’ll use it.The second phone of the day, the OnePlus 7, was left to late in the keynote. While not an afterthought, with many of the OnePlus 7 Pro features meaning it is a tidy upgrade from the OnePlus 6T from last year, it was in the bigger phone’s shadow. Still, it is keenly priced, selling for £499, the same price as last year’s OnePlus 6T. It goes on sale in June.There was one more phone announced, the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, revealed by Pete Lau, Cristiano Amon, the President of Qualcomm, And Mark Allera, CEO of BT’s Consumer Brands. They talked about the power of 5G and predicted the “era of the super-apps”. The prediction was that 5G phones would be thicker and heavier, but OnePlus claims the new phone is near-identical to the 4G OnePlus 7 Pro. Though no date or price was revealed, the company’s first 5G handset was confirmed as coming soon and will be on the EE network.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After face-to-face talks between Mr Corbyn and Ms May, Labour said it would not support the bill without a compromise agreement complete with safeguards to avoid it being unpicked by a future Tory leader. “We are not in the business of getting into a car when we don’t know where it’s going,” said one source.But senior Labour sources refused to rule out the party’s MPs being whipped to abstain in the crucial second reading vote, potentially saving the PM from defeat at the hands of Leave-backing Tory rebels and the DUP.What does the timetable for Theresa May’s departure look like now?Brexit and austerity: the toxic cocktail the young can’t escape Fox claims accepting chlorinated chicken would not affect food safetyHoliday company Tui hit by Brexit uncertainty and 737 Max groundingThe move sparked a hostile response from backers of a second referendum, including one senior shadow cabinet minister who said he would ignore any instruction to abstain.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said: “Labour must not issue a blank cheque to Theresa May over Brexit.“Abstaining would be allowing a Tory Brexit to go ahead without even pressing for a People’s Vote and that would be totally unacceptable, so I hope the party leadership will make it clear that it’s just not on.”\u0026nbspFormer Labour MP Chuka Umunna, chief spokesperson\u0026nbspfor Change UK, said: “By refusing to rule out abstaining on the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the Labour Party is offering Theresa May and her Brexit plan a lifeline. This is the clearest indication yet that the Labour leadership is working with the Tory government to deliver Brexit.”Supporters of EU membership had been buoyed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay’s admission that defeat for the WAB would be the final death knell for the deal laboriously negotiated over two years and agreed with the EU in November.Mr Barclay told a parliamentary committee that if the bill falls “then the Barnier deal is dead in that form and I think the House will have to then address a much more fundamental question between whether it will pursue ... a no-deal option or whether it will revoke”.Downing Street indicated that discussions will take place in the coming weeks not only with Mr Corbyn’s party but also with Tory backbenchers and the\u0026nbspDUP, aiming to win\u0026nbsp“the broadest possible support” for the bill’s passage through the Commons. Asked whether Ms May would go ahead even if no such coalition can be assembled, a source said: “We are going to bring the bill forward in that week.”Cross-party talks with Labour are continuing at official level, but no “plenary” meetings between ministers and their counterparts have been announced.Ms May faces a tough challenge fitting an expected two-day second reading vote into a week when she will be busy with the three-day state visit of the US president, Donald Trump, and D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth and Normandy. Time is even tighter because parliament is not currently scheduled to sit on the Monday or Friday.Aides shrugged off the timing issue, saying Number 10 was “fully aware” of the busy schedule. They declined to say whether the\u0026nbspWAB\u0026nbspwould be published ahead of the Whitsun recess, beginning on 23 May, to give\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsptime to digest the long\u0026nbspand complex constitutional legislation.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader? Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has long been hopeful, he previously stood in the leadership contest that followed the Brexit vote and has at many times since been thought to be maneuvering himself towards the goal. He remains a darling of the party\u0027s right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory voters but his leadership bid would be fiercely opposed by many MPsThe former work and pensions secretary announced that she will be standing for the leadership when May leaves. McVey is the first to explicitly state that she intends to stand. She resigned from the cabinet in protest over May\u0027s Brexit dealEnvironment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour\u0027s no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister\u0027s. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership electionFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied never say neverWork and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is a leading contender from the moderate wing of the party. She returned to the cabinet in November 2018 after resigning as Home Secretary over the handling of the Windrush scandal. Rudd showed off her leadership credentials in the 2017 election campaign, appearing in the televised debate in place of the Prime Minister, who had refused. Her pro-EU leanings, and her tiny 346 majority in Hastings and Rye might count against her among Tory membersHome secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a major incident and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. Son of a bus driver, he wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobilityForeign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race as he could sell himself as the man to unite the party. Critics worry that his long stint as health secretary could return to haunt him at a general election. He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadership.Often seen as a possible caretaker prime minister if Ms May departed, but would want the job on a permanent basis. Has twice run for the Tory leadership. Enjoyed an Indian summer with a surprise return to the cabinet after the 2016 referendum.

Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime MinisterFormer international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent she knows she\u0027s from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she\u0027s reminding everyone she\u0027s there. Patel left the government late in 2017 after it emerged that she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officialsChief secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has been rumoured to be a contender after a recent interview in The Times in which she proposed a number of policies.

She resigned from the cabinet in protest over May\u0027s Brexit dealEnvironment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour\u0027s no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister\u0027s. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership electionFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied never say neverWork and pensions secretary Amber Rudd is a leading contender from the moderate wing of the party. She returned to the cabinet in November 2018 after resigning as Home Secretary over the handling of the Windrush scandal. Rudd showed off her leadership credentials in the 2017 election campaign, appearing in the televised debate in place of the Prime Minister, who had refused. Her pro-EU leanings, and her tiny 346 majority in Hastings and Rye might count against her among Tory membersHome secretary Sajid Javid is said to have a plan in place for a leadership race. He made headlines over Christmas when he declared that people smuggling over the English channel was a major incident and more recently when he revoked the citizenship of ISIS bride Shamima Begum. Son of a bus driver, he wants the Conservatives to be seen as the party of social mobilityForeign secretary Jeremy Hunt was recently thought to be the favourite in the event of a leadership race as he could sell himself as the man to unite the party.

He has reportedly been holding meetings with Tory MPs over breakfast to promote his leadership.Often seen as a possible caretaker prime minister if Ms May departed, but would want the job on a permanent basis. Has twice run for the Tory leadership. Enjoyed an Indian summer with a surprise return to the cabinet after the 2016 referendum. Eclipsed Mr Johnson by resigning first over the Chequers deal.Following the Prime Minister\u0027s second defeat over her Brexit deal, Leader of the house Andrea Leadsom hosted a dinner party at which leadership was the only topic of conversation, The Times heard. Leadsom ran against Theresa May in the 2016 leadership election before dropping out, allowing May to become Prime MinisterFormer international development secretary Priti Patel is thought to be positioning herself as a contender. One MP told The Independent she knows she\u0027s from the right of the party, the part which is going to choose the next leader, so she\u0027s reminding everyone she\u0027s there. Patel left the government late in 2017 after it emerged that she had held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officialsChief secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has been rumoured to be a contender after a recent interview in The Times in which she proposed a number of policies. When asked about her desire to be leader, she replied it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics but I’m absolutely not thinking about itAt Prime Minister’s Questions in the Commons, Ms May\u0026nbspfaced another call for her resignation from one of her own backbenchers.Peter Bone told her that “loyal and dedicated” activists in his Wellingborough constituency had given him a clear message to deliver to her.“They say that her deal is worse than staying in the EU, that they want us to come out now on a no-deal basis, and third, more importantly, they’ve lost confidence in the prime minister and wish her to resign before the European elections,” he said.In a swipe at her backbench critics, the PM retorted: “If everybody in the House of Commons had voted along with the government and the majority of Conservative members of parliament we would already have left the European Union.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The executive is under pressure from Tory MPs to amend a rule that says such a vote can only be held once a year. Ms May saw off an attempt to oust her in December, meaning another vote cannot currently be held until December.Last month, the committee voted narrowly against a rule change but amid growing anger at her handling of Brexit, Ms May will need\u0026nbspto convince them not to change their minds.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to load...Writing in the Daily , former cabinet minister Owen Paterson has warned Theresa May that she risks destroying the Conservative Party and breaking up he UK\u0026nbspunless she accepts defeat and resigns now.\u0026nbspMr Paterson, one of the most senior Tory Eurosceptics, writes:\u0026nbspThis deal will still not get through parliament, and cabinet must remind Mrs May of that. Unless she abandons it, accepts defeat and resigns now, her enduring legacy will instead be to have destroyed the Conservative party and, in all likelihood, to have delivered the rise of a Corbyn-led government bent on crashing the economy and, in cahoots with the SNP, breaking up the United Kingdom itself.Theresa May is currently meeting with the executive of the 1922 Committee, where she is expected to be told to announce a date for her departure or\u0026nbspface the prospect of another vote of no confidence. Don\u0027t go anywhere - we\u0027ll be bringing you news of what happened as soon as we get it.Theresa May\u0027s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, has called on the prime minister to stand aside and end the \u0027national humiliation\u0027 over Brexit\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA bit more from this morning\u0027s lobby briefing...\u0026nbspAsked if the prime minister could guarantee that the vote on second reading of her Withdrawal Agreement Bill would take place in the week of 3 June, Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “Yes.”\u0026nbspWhen pressed on how the probable two-day vote could be made to fit into a week in which the Commons is currently scheduled to sit for just three days and Ms May will be tied up with the state visit of Donald Trump and D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth and Normandy, he replied:\u0026nbsp“Events in relation to the state visit and D-Day commemorations are well known to us and have been factored in.”Theresa May still has confidence in Chris Grayling, despite the scrapping of large parts of his probation system in addition to his long list of blunders in the fields of justice and transport.\u0026nbspAsked by reporters at a Westminster briefing whether the PM had confidence in her transport secretary, Ms May’s official spokesman replied simply: “Yes.”\u0026nbspHe added: “We are very clear that probation services must improve. The reforms bring the right balance of expertise from public, private and voluntary sectors to rehabilitate offenders, cut crime and protect the public.\u0026nbsp“They build on the successful elements of the current system, which has seen an extra 40,000 offenders supervised each year.”\u0026nbspThe spokesman made clear that the government accepts not all elements of the system introduced by Mr Grayling as justice secretary were successful, telling reporters: “There are aspects of the previous reforms that have worked. There are aspects which have not.”Labour MP Jess Phillips says she feels sick at Ukip MEP candidate\u0026nbspCarl Benjamin\u0027s\u0026nbspjokes about raping her.\u0026nbspMr Benjamin, who had previously claimed he wouldn\u0027t even rape the Birmingham Yardley MP,\u0026nbspdefended his comments this morning, telling the BBC\u0027s Victoria Derbyshire Show:I\u0027m aware of the politically correct narrative around this, but there\u0027s another narrative that I suppose we can call the non-politically correct one that I support.I think it\u0027s a lot more empowering to not be controlled by jokes. Survivors of sexual violence find what I\u0027ve said empowering.Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, has warned the government not to allow Chinese company Huawei a role in providing 5G infrastructure in the UK.\u0026nbspMinisters are weighing up the potential security risks of allowing the company access to UK networks, with reports suggesting that Theresa May is minded to do so.\u0026nbspIn the\u0026nbspforeword to a new report by the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, Sir Richard wrote:The fact that the British government now appears to have decided to place the development of some its most sensitive critical infrastructure in the hands of a company from the People\u0027s Republic of China (PRC) is deeply worrying.The PRC uses its sophisticated technical capabilities not only to control its own population (to an extreme and growing degree), but it also conducts remotely aggressive intelligence gathering operations on a global scale.No part of the communist Chinese state is ultimately able to operate free of the control exercised by its Communist Party leadership.To place the PRC in a potentially advantageous exploitative position in the UK\u0027s future telecommunications systems therefore is a risk, however remote it may seem at the moment, we simply do not need to take.In the Commons, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has just\u0026nbspconfirmed\u0026nbspthat Labour will vote against the Withdrawal Agreement Bill when it is put before the MPs at the start of June.\u0026nbspYesterday Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s spokesman refused\u0026nbspmultiple times to rule out Labour abstaining on the bill.\u0026nbspBut Sir Keir says:\u0026nbspI\u0027d have thought\u0026nbspit\u0027s patently clear that if the prime minister\u0027s deal is put for a\u0026nbspfourth time, it will fail just as it\u0027s failed three times already.\u0026nbspI want to make it clear that Labour opposes the idea of passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill\u0026nbspwithout an agreement deal. That would put the cart before the horse and Labour will vote against at\u0026nbspsecond reading on that basis.\u0026nbspHe asks Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay how on earth a bill to implement a deal that isn\u0027t before the House can pass in two weeks time and suggests the decision to bring forward the bill is just designed to keep the prime minister in office for another week.\u0026nbspIllegal immigration to the UK is likely to rise after Brexit, a new study has found\u0026nbspSpeaking ahead of this morning\u0027s meeting of the 1922 Committee executive, the committee\u0027s treasurer,\u0026nbspSir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, says Theresa May must set date for her departure or face being forced out.\u0026nbspHe tells the Press Association:\u0026nbspIt would be infinitely preferable if she set a date rather than us force her out.It\u0027s better that she does it than we have a vote of confidence.What I would like to see is her set out a timetable to trigger a leadership contest.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has said he does not think that\u0026nbspMPs would accept a permanent customs union with the EU.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme:I don\u0027t think parliament would actually accept the concept of a permanent customs union for a whole range of reasons that I\u0027ve set out - and I don\u0027t think it would be acceptable inside the Conservative Party.Of course we do have a temporary customs union inside the implementation period, that is already accepted, but one of the reasons that we embarked on this particular process was so that we would be out of these arrangements by the time we got to the next general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May will\u0026nbsphold talks with the executive of the 1922 Committee, which represents Tory MPs, this morning as she faces pressure to announce a date for her departure.\u0026nbspThe prime minister has already said she will step down if her Brexit deal is approved by parliament\u0026nbspbut many Conservative MPs want her to announce a timetable for her resignation even if she does not get an exit plan through the Commons.\u0026nbspThe 1922 executive is under pressure to change party rules to allow another vote of no confidence in the prime minister. It has so far refused to do so but it is unclear whether that will remain the case if Ms May refuses to give a date for standing down.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It must come from and draw upon the collective wisdom of Labour\u0027s half a million members, who live and work in every community across the country.This is especially true when Tom Watson’s new group of MPs are intent upon watering down and blocking Labour’s most transformational policies.She added: Labour\u0027s manifesto in 2017 was groundbreaking, and showed there is widespread support for common sense socialism. But now we must build on this success and go further.Ahead of the Labour\u0027s annual conference in the autumn, Momentum said it had thrown its weight behind policy motions, which include the introduction a four-day working week, the abolition of all migrant detention centres, and a Green New Deal - aiming for Britain to go zero carbon by 2030.It will use its campaigning strength over the summer months and attempt to persuade Constituency Labour Party (CLP) groups across the country to back the radical measures.Momentum fined over £16,000 for multiple breaches of electoral lawLabour has \u0027much larger\u0027 group of antisemites, Momentum founder warnsMomentum chief warns new group pose a threat that could damage LabourSo far, Momentum has not adopted a formal Brexit policy distinct from the Labour leadership and currently backs the agreed conference resolution to keep all options on the table, including a Final Say referendum.\u0026nbspMs Boumelha added: These are the kind of policies we need to fundamentally reshape our society, irreversibly shifting wealth and power towards the working class and laying the groundwork for a society that works in the interests of the many, not the few.\u0026nbspMomentum defended Corbyn when his leadership was under threat. Now Momentum will defend and extend the most transformational parts of Labour’s programme, supporting members to pass policy at conference and build on Labour’s 2017 manifesto.”Toby Barnes, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, added: ”With little more than a decade to prevent catastrophic climate breakdown, we need a wholesale transformation of every aspect of the economy.\u0026nbspOur campaign provides an opportunity for Labour members to lead a radical reconstruction of our country from the ground up. With Momentum putting its weight behind these motions, a transformative policy agenda is in sight.

Groups such as the ACLU point to its test of Amazon’s facial recognition programme – called Amazon Rekognition – as proof, after scanning images of members of Congress and comparing them to archived arrest photos. Twenty-eight legislators were incorrectly matched, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Meanwhile, critics say police need all the help they can get, especially in a city with high-profile events and high rates of property crime. That people expect privacy in public space is unreasonable given the proliferation of cell phones and surveillance cameras, said Meredith Serra, a member of a resident public safety group Stop Crime SF.“To me, the ordinance seems to be a costly additional layer of bureaucracy that really does nothing to improve the safety of our citizens,” she said at the same hearing.San Francisco’s new rule, which is set to go into effect in a month if a second vote, considered a formality goes ahead, forbids the use of facial-recognition technology by the city’s 53 departments — including the San Francisco police department, which doesn’t currently use such technology, CNN said. However, the ordinance carves out an exception for federally controlled facilities at San Francisco International Airport and the Port of San Francisco.\u0026nbspLate last year, the president of Microsoft called for greater government regulation of AI facial recognition technology, because of the risk of it discriminating against women and people of colour.Brad Smith said such regulation would help avoid “a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success”.Facial recognition tech trained on of photos of people without consentBefore facial recognition tech can be used, it needs to be limitedTaylor Swift uses facial recognition software to identify stalkersNew iPhone to improve facial recognition feature, report claimsThe comments of Mr Smith, 59, which were released at the same time as a report by a research group consisting of both Microsoft and Google employees also calling for more regulation, are especially noteworthy because of the controversy the company triggered earlier this year over comments about its work with AI.In June, the company’s general manager Tom Keane, wrote how proud Microsoft was to be working with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to use facial recognition technology to help identify immigrants and process applications.Additional reporting by Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bill passed late on Wednesday with support from the governing coalition of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz‘s conservative People’s Party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). Almost all of the opposition voted against it. Former Social Democrat Party education minister Sonja Hammerschmid accused the government of focusing on chasing headlines rather than acting to improve child welfare.The measure does not specifically mention Muslim women, but bans wearing “ideologically or religiously characterised clothing” covering the head, and specifically refers to items “that cover the whole or large parts of the hair”.Created with Sketch.Which countries have banned the burqa?

BTS does not support a boycott of Israel, but campaigns to end the military occupation of the West Bank.The gaggle of mostly European tourists they took around Hebron snaked through the settlement areas\u0026nbspand streets of shuttered Palestinians shops.At the last point of the tour when the group was due to meet Palestinian peace activists, the Israeli military issued a warrant temporarily designating\u0026nbspthe area\u0026nbspas a\u0026nbsp“closed military zone”.\u0026nbspEveryone had to leave.“Enjoy Eurovision,” Amro shouts to the retreating group he was not permitted to meet.“One day we’ll have Hebron-vision. I promise,” he jokes.This vignette is one of many to have\u0026nbspunderscored the tensions at this year’s Eurovision in Israel, one of the most political fraught and contentious ones\u0026nbspyet.Just over a week before celebrations were due to kick off, and ahead of the arrival of Madonna, who is due to headline the finale on Saturday, the country looked like it was on the cusp of a war with militants in Gaza.Palestinian armed groups fired nearly 700 rockets and projectiles at the south of the country in just two days.Israel responded by pounding 350 targets within the besieged territory.Thirty were killed on both sides, in one of the bloodiest upticks of violence since the 2014 war, before Egypt and the United Nations were able to broker a temporary and fragile ceasefire that still holds. For now.Hackers also broke into a live-stream webcast of the competition with a false rocket alarm and images of explosions.Viewers tuning in to the webcast on Tuesday were warned: “Risk of Missile Attack. Please Take Shelter,” under a fake logo of the Israeli army, followed by images of explosions near the Eurovision venue.“Israel is NOT safe. You will see!”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIsrael’s public broadcaster alleged that Hamas, the group that\u0026nbsprules the Gaza Strip, was behind the hack.In what can only exacerbate\u0026nbsptensions,\u0026nbspthe week chosen for Eurovision coincides with several difficult anniversaries.Wednesday, day two of Eurovision, is known as Nakba day (“day of the catastrophe”) by Palestinians, who each 15 May commemorate when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced to leave their homes during the conflict which surrounded the creation of Israel.During last year’s protests for Nakba day, Israeli snipers killed nearly 60 people along the Gaza border fence, another bloody anniversary prominent in many minds.Many are also angered by the location of Eurovision.The Expo Centre in Tel Aviv, where the acts are performing, is built over the ruins of Palestinian village Shaykh Muwannis, while Eurovision’s sprawling seafront village is constructed over the ruins of a mostly Arab, pre-1948 neighbourhood called Al-Manshiyya.And so the event has\u0026nbspalso been hounded by activists spearheaded by the Palestinian-led campaign Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS).Earlier in the year the group\u0026nbsprecruited the support of dozens of British celebrities including Vivienne Westwood, actor Julie Christie and singer Peter Gabriel, who signed a letter published by  calling on the BBC to demand that Eurovision be relocated.The BDS campaign, which is effectively outlawed by the Israeli authorities who passed legislation against it two years ago, has not prevented any of the competition’s 41 acts from joining in the show, or thousands flying into to enjoy the festivities.However, it has seen a number of protests pop up across Israel and the Palestinian territories.On Tuesday evening, while jubilant crowds gathered to watch the opening of Eurovision on huge screens at Tel Aviv’s Eurovision village, local and international activists blocked streets in other parts of the country’s commercial and cultural hub.A few days ago, as the competition’s acts strutted down the red carpet, more than a dozen Israeli and international pro-Palestinian activists wearing blindfolds knelt in rows and tried to prevent people accessing the venue, saying they were protesting “cultural washing”.More rallies have been planned for Saturday by “No Pride in Apartheid”, a protest group of Israeli feminists and anarchists.In fact, an entire “protest” alternative to Eurovision is underway.“Gaza Message”, saw Palestinian musicians on Tuesday play among the ruins of buildings bombed in the last round of Israeli strikes.Thousands to boycott Airbnb over listings in occupied West Bank“Gazavision”, which mimics the Eurovision structure, will also be held later in the week as an entirely separate music competition showcasing the Palestinian talent forbidden to travel to international competitions.It is unclear how much of an impact it has had. The Israelis have launched a determined PR campaign countering calls for a boycott, with Israeli public broadcaster Kan releasing\u0026nbspa tongue-in-cheek musical advert, quipping that Israel is “much more” than a “land war and occupation”.\u0026nbspThe government has taken a tough approach to the boycott movement that it accuses\u0026nbspof having ties to “terrorism and antisemitism”.A spokesperson from Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs tells\u0026nbspThe Independent that music is a means “best used to build bridges and unite people, not ide them”.The ministry accuses\u0026nbspthe boycott movement of trying to manipulate public opinion on social media “to no success”.“Such actions only reveal the true face of BDS – they have no interest in dialogue but rather try to promote ision,” the ministry adds.At the Eurovision village, as the semi-finals kicks\u0026nbspoff, most visitors are\u0026nbsppreoccupied with who is\u0026nbspgoing to win.“To be honest I haven’t really noticed anything about any protests but Eurovision is a moment where everyone comes together which is more important,” says\u0026nbspJan, from the Netherlands, who says\u0026nbspit is\u0026nbspparticularly important for his country as\u0026nbspits\u0026nbspentrant is the favourite.Michael Rice, the UK’s contestant, admits\u0026nbsphe has not heard much about conflict, or rocket fire, before he landed in Tel Aviv but saw there were some acts, like the Iceland’s entrant Hatari who visited Hebron and have called publicly for an end to the occupation.“I don’t really know much about it, as I’m not really political, but I have seen a lot about the boycott movement,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent during a launch party held by the British embassy before Eurovision kicked off.Eurovision is staving off Israeli-Palestinian conflict – for now“But every country has something going on,” he adds.Madonna, who is due to make a guest appearance on Saturday, has, however, come under fire, particularly because her Ray of Light foundation, a social justice program, supports a number of Palestinian projects, including funding teachers’ salaries at UN schools across Gaza.The Queen of Pop has\u0026nbspdefended her decision to play, saying in a statement to Reuters: “I’ll never stop playing music to suit someone’s political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be.”“I hope and pray that we will soon break free from this terrible cycle of destruction and create a new path towards peace.”Breaking the Silence plans to run many more tours over the week.Avner Gvaryahu, a former Israeli paratrooper and one of the leading members of the group, says\u0026nbspthat members of Eurovision delegations and even some performers have\u0026nbspreached out to them to join tours.“We have to end this military occupation for sake of Israelis and Palestinians. We are breaking the silence, part of our job is shedding a light on some of these hardships,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.Wolf Alice back Eurovision boycott of \u0027human rights abusers\u0027 Israel“The thinking was that it was important that the people who came to enjoy this place, and the liberal values of Eurovision, take another step.“That they don’t just enjoy the nightlife in Tel Aviv, the beach during the day, but understand the complexity of the place that they’re in,” he adds.\u0026nbspMany on their tour, who knew little about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict before getting on the bus, find\u0026nbspthemselves flanked and heckled by heavily armed settlers, as well as tailed by the military. They say\u0026nbspit was important trip to take.\u0026nbsp“Eurovision is an opportunity for Israel to present themselves as white washing what is going on here,” says\u0026nbspKarl, 24, from Germany, who was on his first trip to the country.“People have flocked to parties on the beach, they are waving the flags with no understanding of what is going on around them.

Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot then tried to get him via video link from jail, but he again refused to participate.In , when -year-old Toronto woman Rehab Dughmosh refused to appear in court on terror-related charges, even liberal old Canada issued an “extremely rare” legal order for the wonderfully phrased “cell extraction”.Five officers were given the authority to,necessary, restrain and drag her to court by the scruff of her neck even , as one court official put it: “It may require shackles on the hands and feet.”Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.So, did -year-old McCann, from Aylesbury, Bucks, get the same treatment  Dream on. Instead, the judge, court clerk and prosecution and defence teams were all forced to up sticks and travel  miles to the prison with, don’t laugh, the official court crest in an Argos carrier bag.There, the judge visited McCann in the healthcare wing, where he refused to confirm his name, wouldn’t stand and, at one point, reportedly turned his back to the impromptu hearing before stating he had “been stitched up”.And it seems he’s not alone in this disgraceful behaviour that’s being indulged by our pathetically weak “justice” system.Last year, Gloucester’s top judge, Jamie Tabor QC, said it has now “become fashionable for defendants to refuse to come to court”, noting that the worrying trend started around two years earlier.Yet as far back as , convicted drug dealer Amir Ali refused to attend a confiscation hearing at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex because he feared losing his cell to another inmate while he was away and claimed it was a breach of his human rights.At the time, Judge Richard Hayward lashed out at the “barking mad” rules stemming from the  Human Rights Act. He added: “I didn’t know that prisoners could choose whether or not to come to court. I just assumed they would be scooped up by a burly prison warden and dumped in the back of a van.” So did we, Judge. So did we.Yet here we are,  years later, still allowing the human rights of an alleged criminal to run roughshod over the court’s authority.IT’S rumoured that -year-old Grace Jones may be filming a scene with Daniel Craig for the upcoming th Bond movie. Cue much excitement about unleashing the power of the older woman, yada yada.Bring it on. But let’s hope Ms Jones’ character fares better than the last time an “older actress” was announced, amid much fanfare, for the movie Spectre.It was -year-old Monica Bellucciand the scene involved her being groped up against a wall by Daniel Craig, who then left her languishing in a basque and stockings while he went off and fell in love with someone younger.The earth may well have moved for Monica’s character, but ground-breaking it was not.MADELEINE McCANN would have been  on Sunday. Sweet . The age when girls start to blossom into young women, steal our make-up and clothes, have myriad crushes and secrets we might never find out about.Instead, her parents Kate and Gerry have passed another torturous year of not knowing whether she’s dead or alive.Wishing their daughter a happy birthday on their Find Maddie Facebook page, they added: “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.”Spending a quiet day at home with their other two children, they reportedly placed presents in Maddie’s room and blew out the candles on a commemorative cake.To not celebrate would perhaps feel like an abandonment of hope. My heart goes out to them and all the other parents of missing children. What they’ve been through – and continue to endure – is unimaginable.THE first rule of “modern friendship”, apparently, is never failing to “like” or comment on a pal’s social media posts.PRINCE CHARLES is advertising for a gardener to tend the herbaceous borders of his house on Scotland’s vast Balmoral Estate.Their skill set should include a love of the outdoors, green fingers and, presumably, the ability to e out of harm’s way should Prince Philip ever choose to drive over for a visit.A GP surgery in Cambridgeshire has hired staff who speak a record  languages to cope with patients born abroad.GENTLEMAN JACK actress Suranne Jones reveals that producers brought in an “intimacy director” to make sure the TV show’s sex scenes “do right by the lesbian community”.Nice workyou can get it.

One of the key factors in being a successful royal is to sympathise with the plight of the less well off proles, or at the very least pretend to.This blatant plug for a friend’s luxury bolthole fails on both counts.LONDON Mayor hopeful Shaun Bailey says university quotas for black students would be ultimately “debilitating” because it would make them feel they didn’t have people’s “respect”.He’s right.

known as fetal head moulding.These changes occur during the second stage of labour, when the baby leaves the uterus and moves through the birth canal.However, the details of fetal head moulding remain unclear, and only one prior study has captured images of this process.But now scientists from the Auvergne University in Clermont Ferrand, France, have captured in detail how the head changes before and during the second stage of labour.Their analysis, published in the journal PLOS ONE, revealed all of the infants went through fetal head moulding, with dferent parts of the skull overlapping to ying degrees.After birth, fth of the newborns skull and brain shapes ed to their pre-birth state, but the changes persisted in two of the infants.Two of the three infants with the greatest degree of fetal head moulding were delivered by emergency C-section, but the third was delivered vaginally with minimal expulsive efforts.Dr Olivier Ami, who led the team, saud: During vaginal delivery, the fetal brain shape undergoes deformation to ying degrees depending on the degree of overlap of the skull bones.Fetal skull moulding is no more visible in most newborns after birth.Some skulls accept the deformation and allow an easy delivery, while others do not deform easily.Overall, the findings suggest that infants experience greater skull stresses during birth than previously thought.The team say it could potentially underlie the asymptomatic brain and retinal bleeding seen in many newborns after vaginal delivery.They note that a larger study is needed to confirm their findings, but that their work demonstrates the value of D MRI in capturing fetal head moulding."},{"url":null,"title":"christ like figure appears in clouds","story":"Monica Aramayo was in San Salvador de Jujuy in Argentina when she noticed the holy figure shining through the thick clouds.The picture which has since gone viral also appeared to show “Jesus” wearing a crown.Social media user Mariela Romano said: “The Lord will soon come for us all and we should be ready.While another said: “Thanks for the image that allows us to keep on our path and have a better hope for tomorrow.”But others were not able to see the illusion in the clouds.The image has since viral and some have compared it to the Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil overlooking the city.Romina Salinas said: “I personally only see the sun coming through the clouds, but people see what they want to see.It comes after we revealed a bloke from Kent claims to have seen the face of Jesus in his CURTAINS."},{"url":null,"title":"wheelie bins confiscated wrong rubbish","story":"Kirklees Council in Leeds warned residents that bins would be taken away for six months as punishmentthey couldnt follow waste guidelines.Since April, advisers have accompanied collectors to inspect bins -

Really ”Under its plans, Labour vowed to set up a public authority to oversee the entire gas and electricity network – staffed by political appointments, workers reps and environmentalists.And it wants “pro-active” town halls and parish councils to step forward and manage energy at a municipal level.In leaked documents, Labour states that Hackney Council could take over supply from the London regional energy agency.Or it suggests a parish council in Cornwall could run the local distribution grid and integrate “solar and storage solutions”.Labour would seize the privately-run National Grid and electricity network, paying negligible compensation: Simple theft, from , Brits with shares.Businesses and investors would flee as the Marxists snatch private property.

Labour claimed the figures speak for themselves hours after the party published plans to renationalise the energy grid. Business groups voiced alarm over Labouraposs plans, warning shareholders were unlikely to be paid the market value for assets estimated at £ billion.

Howeber, statutory pre-tax profit was given as the lower figure of £.billion after one-off costs, including the termination of UK nuclear projects and snowstorms on the US east coast. Labour would create a National Energy Agency and  Regional Energy Agencies to replace the National Grid. They would then be tasked with tackling fuel poverty and protecting energy as a human right.  Labour would also draw on a £bn fund to provide free solar  for a million social homes and low-income households. An additional £ million would allow another , householders to install the they chose to, worth an average £ per household.  They would get an interest free loan to pay for the system upfront, which would save them money by generating their own electricity.  The move could provide free energy and save low-income households an average of £ a year on their bills, rising to £ for retirees.

A damning poll reveals three in five people think the Tories are letting down the army of small firms which are vital to the economy and town centres. The findings come from a YouGov survey of , adults for the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, which was founded by Margaret Thatcher. It revealed % of people believed the Government “is not on the side of small business”, with just % disagreeing.  Some % did not know. The -page Think Small study, due to be unveiled in London today by Mr Javid, calls on ministers to overhaul taxes for small businesses, some of which are the leblood of town centres. The Mirror has waged a High Street Fightback campaign - and a shake-up could fuel a revival of our ailing town centres. Report author Nick King, head of business at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: “Small businesses are the backbone of the British economy, making up more than % of all businesses.  “Government has a duty to protect their interests so our economy can continue to thrive. “But the current one-size-fits-all model is failing small business too many of them are strangled by paperwork, bureaucracy and administration, costing them time and money. “The polling commissioned for this report shows both the public and owners and managers of small businesses do not think the Government is on the side of small businesses, but that it should be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"steel chiefs issue fresh bid","story":"NewsSteel chiefs issue fresh bid for Government and companies to buy BritishEXCLUSIVE: The steel charter developed by UK Steel will be formally published next weekShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSteel chiefs are launching a fresh bid to urge the Government and big firms to buy British and boost UK industry. Sector bosses will call on Whitehall ministries, major companies and huge infrastructure projects to purchase UK-made metals for multimillion-pound schemes. They want them to sign a new charter aimed at maximising the amount of UK-produced steel used in construction ventures. The Government is expected to purchase £.billion worth of steel in the next five years for rail, roads, schools, hospitals and warships.  UK Steel wants as much as possible to be sourced from our shores, with bodies signing up to its charter. Speaking ahead of a launch event in Parliament next week, UK Steel director Gareth Stace said: “This initiative will encourage as many organisations as possible to take a more proactive and thoughtful approach to their procurement of steel in the future, and importantly publicise the exemplar approach that many organisations are already taking.” Community steelworkersapos union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “This is an important initiative and a welcome step forward to support our steel industry. Steel unions have long-campaigned for government at all levels to maximise the procurement opportunities for UK steel producers. I hope that the charter will be widely used and adopted and the positive examples of good procurement practice are followed.  Procurement remains a vitally important part of any joined-up industrial strategy, and, along with tackling issues such as industrial energy costs, must be part of any sector deal. What is needed now is the political will to make procurement work for our industry – the steel charter sets out how this can be achieved.” The charter was backed by British Steel, the country’s second-biggest producer, which is locked in talks with ministers about a lesaving Government loan. Chief executive Gerald Reichmann said: “This initiative can help increase the amount of high-quality steel manufactured in Britain going into thousands of domestic construction projects, something which will have a positive impact on the supply chain and wider UK economy. “We encourage as many signatories as possible to sign the charter while informing all parties within the UK supply chain of this new approach which builds on the existing government procurement policy notice.” The charter is a boost for the Mirror’s Save Our Steel campaign, waged amid thousands of job losses and plant closures in .    Earlier, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt dropped the biggest hint yet yesterday that a UK shipyard will win a £billion deal for new Royal Navy support ships. Unions welcomed the signal, which fuelled hopes the Government will back British workers by awarding the bumper contract to a UK consortium. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, the Cabinet Minister said: “It’s long order books and steady drum beats in our yards that strengthen our supply chain and bring down the overall cost of procurement.  “What’s needed is a closer partnership with industry that gives them the confidence to invest and build, and us the confidence that we can and we must buy British.”The Ministry of Defence is under pressure to pledge to build two, possibly three, Fleet Solid Support ships in Britain. The vital vessels will resupply warships, including the Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier, with ammunition, explosives and food. Ms Mordaunt, a Royal Navy reservist who spoke about watching the Falklands War naval task force leave Portsmouth when she was nine-years-old, dubbed them “our logistic backbone”. The deal has been put out to international tender and five firms, including one UK consortium, are in the running.  A decision is due next year and unions have launched the Keep Britain Afloat campaign to demand the contract stays in Britain. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: “The new Secretary of State is at a crossroads which will decide whether she spends her time in office dealing with redundancies and closure or delivering the Navy of the future. “We welcome any change of heart that recognises the importance of maintaining the UK’s ability to design, build and maintain naval ships at home. “Shipyard workers across the country have been campaigning hard, as part of the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, to ensure that these ships are built in Britain because shipbuilding offers le chances for young people, supports communities, maintains highly-skilled technical and service jobs and keeps taxpayer investment in the UK.

Senior Tories want the Prime Minister to set a timetable for her departure from No  evenBrexit remains unresolved. She has promised to stand down when the first phase of Brexit is done but has resisted naming a date for her departure. But MPs on the  executive could take matters into their own hands and change party rules to allow another confidence vote. Rebel MPs have warned that Mrs May faces defeat when she tries to get the withdrawal agreement bill through Parliament.  Parliament is expected to get a vote, possibly on th June, the same week as Donald Trump’s visit and the Peterborough by-election. Top ministers yesterday admitted it would be the end of the road for her Brexit dealit is rejectd for a fourth time. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said: “I thinkthe House of Commons does not approve the WAB then theBarnier deal is dead in that form.” Mrs May’s spokesman refused to rule out giving MPs a fth vote on the deal. But No  admitted the bill could end up becoming a confidence vote in her already fragile premiership. “That’s not the world we’re currently in but clearly the signicance of this piece of legislation can’t, and won’t, be underestimated,” a spokesman said.

Nigel Dodds of the hardline DUP said it was “highly likely” the deal would be defeated again unless the PM could “demonstrate something new” that addressed the problem of the controversial Irish border backstop.And Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone called on the PM to quit before next week’s European elections as he read out a letter from his local Conservatives at PMQs . Remain-backing Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs said they would vote down any agreement unless it had a referendum attached, while the SNP has said their  MPs would oppose.The PM’s husband, Philip May, was phone canvassing at Tory HQ ahead of next week’s European elections on Tuesday night.

Headmistress Deborah Stanley scrapped the end-of-term celebration for all  pupils in year  at Maidstone Grammar School for Girls in Kent as a result of the stunt. Mums and dads have now vowed to organise a aposrebelapos ball for the sixteen-year-olds instead. They say the girls are aposdevastatedapos over the move and say only a handful of pupils who organised the prank are responsible.  The culprits, said to be as few as five pupils, had hoped schoolmistresses would be scratching their bottoms after using the loos. Some also used Fairy washing-up liquid and soap to smear the buildingaposs stairs. Miss Stanley took a dim view and sent the parents of the entire Year  a message last week that the prom was cancelled because of apospranksapos which were a breach of health and safety rules. Many girls were in tears when the news broke and angered parents. Miss Stanley said students had overstepped the mark on the traditional prank-filled aposMuck up dayapos. Parents begged the head to make a U-turn claiming only a small number of girls were involved. A group of parents and pupils have now banded together on social media to organise their own aposrebelapos event and at least  are said to be involved. One parent backing the mutiny, who asked to remain anonymous, said the headaposs punishment was out of proportion. It is a long known tradition that students get up to mischief on their last day of school, they said. So to have their end of school prom - their celebration of three years of hard work and GCSE success, and the last event to say goodbye to friends - taken away from them is an outrage. A committee of pupils had spent six months making arrangements for the blow-out, using their lunchtimes and free time after school, said the parent.  The Prom Committee is deflated, feeling that their organisation and work is now worthless. And despite being so proud of the prom that they had put together, they are all devastated that their hard work was for nothing. A lot of the girlsapos parents have ordered expensive prom dresses, some made-to-measure from overseas, which cannot be ed. In her letter sent home to parents, Miss Stanley said The school cannot and will not tolerate unacceptable behaviour with signicant impacts on the health, safety and well being of all in the school community. I am sorry for those students who have worked hard and were not involved. Our collective aim for all Year  students is that they are prepared and focused for their GCSE examinations. Staff are continuing to work hard with their classes to support Year  in their preparations between now and half term. I wish all Year  students the very best for their GCSE examinations and look forward to celebrating their successes with them in August. The letter said all those who have bought tickets for the prom would be refunded. One angry parent said the prom organising committee have seen their efforts aposwasted and money has been spent on expensive dresses and shoes for nothingapos. One pupil, calling herself Year Mggs said on social media I am in year . I wasnapost even in school on Friday as I was at a hospital appointment and I came in halfway through the day only to find out that our prom had been cancelled.  I was absolutely outraged. It may just be a prom but to some of us who are leaving the school it was a chance to say goodbye to the people who we are probably never going to see again. Local residents had their say on social media. Sombre Reptile wrote If the school has a Muck Up Day, it must expect things to be Mucked Up. The action taken is typical of teachers. They donapost have the backbone to find and deal with the alleged culprits - they take the easy option and blame everyone and think that is justice. But Clark Kent wrote: The head is right to stand her ground - she is trying to set a standard in the school. No issues with the parents organising a new prom for the children - as they get older and encounter a problem, making a fuss and stamping your feet doesnapost make it go away. Le doesnapost work like that. Now ffs go and enjoy the prom - then we can all get some peace!  Karrot Top said: If washing-up liquid and soap were put on the stairs, then that goes well beyond a prank and I can see why the head is so perturbed. It would appear that a few may have spoiled it for the majority. ManfKnt wrote: The school hasnapost done themselves any favors with this stance. Should have banned the culprits who are responsible and allowed the Prom to continue. Thataposs how you learn personal responsibility for your own actions.  Zedboy said: Letaposs hope the girls who outrageously overstepped the mark actually learn a lesson in le  Unlikely given the parents efforts to ignore the issue.

Karine Walker was shocked to find her back garden in Hull had been ripped apart and strewn with traffic signs by Hull City Council contractors. Working without her consent, the labourers dug up earth, dumped bright orange cones and signs, and then shoved a scrumpled up note explaining what theyaposd done through the familyaposs letter box. When Karine ed from a hospital appointment with her son she was shocked to discover what they had done.Months later the mess is yet to be cleared up, reports Hull Live .   “I just found this little ripped up piece of paper shoved through the door when I had no idea any work was going to be carried out, the mum-of-three said. “Yorkshire Water said the drainage company should not have touched any of the pipes because it was Yorkshire Water’s pipes so now there is a dispute between them and the council. For months we’ve just been left with this big mess in the garden and no one is telling us anything.” Karine lives in the house - which she has rented from the council for the past seven years - with her thirteen-year-old daughter and two boys, aged six and seven.

Everything they’ve cut off they’ve just dumped at the back of my garden.” Karine is now fighting to get compensation so she can fix her garden and take it back to how it was earlier this year. She continued: I want somebody to take the blame and fix the garden. I want compensation and somebody needs to do something. “It looks like a dumping ground and I didn’t realise they would cause this much damage. They have wrecked my garden, they have literally wrecked it.” Even the familyaposs -year-old neighbour is getting in on the action. Margret Hickson said: It’s a bit of a mess and it’s not fair because she’s got little kids. I feel sorry for Karine because she’s got a paddling pool for the kids with summer coming and they’ve got no place to put it.    “We just want some help from somewhere for her.” A spokeswoman for Hull City Council said an inspection of the Karineaposs garden was undertaken after she told them about drainage problems in her garden.

Razan, , fled to Britain with her family seven years ago after her husband had a lucky escape from a car bomb under his office in Damascus. Her host is third-generation ­fisherman Bob Roberts, . He is a committed Brexiteer who thinks ­immigration should be controlled. We have asked Bob and Razan to meet today as part of Britain Talks, a pioneering project that asks people with erging views to spend time together, find common ground and discover the real people behind the politics. The two are soon sharing their views on everything from business rates to Brexit , immigration and the unpredictable Yorkshire weather . Will they find, in the words of the late Labour MP Jo Cox, that they have far more in common than that which ides them Razan travels to Scarborough, on the picturesque but sometimes neglected North Yorkshire coast, to see where Bob lives and works. She heads to the bustling south harbour, from where Bob heads out at dawn each day in his distinctive red, blue and black boat, Capernaum, with a small crew to catch  lobsters and the odd crab. Bob sells them to shops and restaurants across the UK – a market that has been dominated by Canadian imports. Today he greets Razan in Arabic – learnt from time spent working in Iraq when he was younger – before passing her a le jacket and inviting her on board.  He tells her: “We’re in a bubble here in Scarborough – we don’t have much foreign labour. People have a duty to integrate. I worry about people who are radicalised coming here. “You see photographs of Damascus and Aleppo and think how the hell are people living there. “Once it’s stable I think there should be an ambition that theyand rebuild their own country.” Former Royal Navy submariner Bob is a committed Brexiteer who thinks Britain should leave the European Union as quickly as possible. He sees Brexit as essential to the future of his ailing industry. As they head out of the harbour, he explains the relationship between Britain’s fishing industry and the EU, which Razan had not been aware of before.  They make an unlikely pair – she in her white headscarf, snapping pictures of the horizon on her smartphone, and Bob in wellies and waterproofs, steering them expertly through the water. Showing Razan where he bags his famous Yorkshire lobsters, Bob tells her: “I voted for Brexit to end the Common Fisheries Policy, and so we can have control over our own waters. “Then we could build our coastal communities back up. As an exporting and maritime nation we should be taking advantage of our own waters.” Razan and husband Raghil arrived in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in  with their children Angie, , Yara, nine and Kareem, seven, and very little .  Razan, who is Muslim, was still in the process of becoming a British citizen at the time of the Brexit referendum in , so was not able to vote – but she does not want to leave Europe. She says: “I think as a general point it’s better to work together when you can. This feels like a orce and it isn’t being managed very well. It is very messy.” When Razan tells Bob about her food business, the Yorkshire Dama Cheese Company, his eyes light up. The two entrepreneurs quickly realise they share a passion for hard work and a pride in regional Yorkshire produce. Back on dry land the pair head to a local cafe, Lookout On The Pier, for freshly caught fish and chips. Then they walk up the steep, cobbled streets to his cottage, with its “Fishermen for Leave” sticker in the window, to chat more over cups of Yorkshire tea.  Bob will make avisit to her a week later – finding out more about how refugee families like hers are working hard to make a new home, and sharing food and ideas at her kitchen table. Razan founded her cheese company after arriving in the UK and finding she could buy the halloumi that she loved. Now it is a thriving business, scooping top awards and employing local people at its Sowerby Bridge base. For Razan, the business is everything - her livelihood, her children’s future, and a way of creating a new le here. She says: “Being a business has helped me fit in more. I feel very strongly that when you are in a new country you need to give something back, to get involved, that’s how you get settled.” So when Bob visits, his first stop is the production centre in Sowerby Bridge. Razan proudly leads him on a tour of the small factory, explaining why she loves the area’s fresh milk, and her plans for a new deli. Then they head to her terraced home, a short drive away in Huddersfield. In her kitchen they prepare a tantalising buffet of their produce – lobster and halloumi - all made or caught in the last few days.  They are both impressed – Razan says the lobster is “the taste of Scarborough”, and Bob says he is a halloumi convert. A well as enjoying great food, they have loved meeting each other. But have they changed any of their opinions  For Bob, it has been “eye-opening”. He says: “A lot of people have a negative viewpoint about refugees but we need to be open-minded and embrace ­immigration. What’s impressed me is Razan’s ability to integrate and adapt, settling here and making it work.” Spending time with Razan has deepened his understanding of the refugee experience. He adds: “It’s been really special – understanding her plight, and how people overcome their problems. “Immigration enriches a country. But I do believe in controls. It’s all about controlling who comes in. “We’ve come a long way. We’ve got a lot in common and a lot to build on.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman baby knocked ground during","story":"NewsWoman and baby knocked to the ground during nasty daytime muggingThe pair were making their way to Ashton Park, in Liverpool, when the thug launched a savage attackShareByJenny Kirkham:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe baby and pram crashed to the ground during the attack before the womans handbag was stolen \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum pushing her baby in a pram was punched in the head during a aposnastyapos mugging which left them both on the ground.

One of the big things is we reached a point where we understood the play-offs were probably going to be a more realistic route and we have been focusing on that recently.“It means we are excited more than disappointed and that is important because we should be going into these games thinking about what a great opportunity they are for us.“We have some good experience and some very good young players and, with that mix, it’s an exciting time and we are really looking forward to it.”And Connolly is in no doubt that, of all the teams involved in the post-season process, Robbie Neilson’s Tangerines are the ones that have shown most improvement over the second half of the season.“We are a team on the up. We have shown that and, mentally, we’ve come on. There have been a few hoodoo games the lads had before Christmas, when they struggled against certain teams, that we’ve now won in the past couple of months and that’s a big positive.“And we have to be confident and look to enjoy these ties because, when you are like that going into games, that’s when you play well.”On a personal level, Connolly will be giving his all to get to the top flight. He rates the Championship highly but his reason for ing north of the border from Crawley Town was to get another taste of le in the Premiership.“Every player in Scotland wants to play in the Premiership and,you have the opportunity to get there, you have to take it with both hands.“As a football club, we have the opportunity to get back to the Premiership and, while it’s going to be tough, we are excited and happy to be in that position.“We’ve got a very, very good chance to get there and we are all up for it.“Obviously, it’s not going to be easy because the other teams involved want to be playing there next season as well but we feel we have the quality to get through these games successfully.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"ovo-energy-tour-series-motherwell-roads-closed-all-day","story":"ROADS in and around Motherwellrsquos town centre will be closed all day todayfor a cycling event."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-set-for-two-days-of-roasting-23c-weather-as-hot-as-ibiza","story":"THE Met Office has warned Glaswegians of a ldquohigh sunburn risk as temperatures reach degC across the city and its surrounding areas today ."},{"url":null,"title":"race-for-life-glasgow-all-the-road-closures","story":"ALMOST  roads across Glasgow will close on Sunday as thousands of runners take to the streets for Cancer Research UKrsquos annual Race For Le."},{"url":null,"title":"clutha-fai-helicopter-bosses-were-struggling-to-cope-with-demand-to-replace-faulty-fuel-sensors-glasgow-fai-hears","story":"A SENIOR avionics expert for the operators of the Clutha helicopter said fuel probe problems were becoming a \"semi-regular\" occurrence across the fleet, an inquiry has heard."},{"url":null,"title":"youre-never-too-young-to-be-a-car-designer-according-to-these-glasgow-primary-pupils","story":"Itrsquos never too early to start designing your first car mdash just ask the primary school pupils who recently showcased their own special prototypes at Glasgow City Chambers."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-pledges-to-become-the-first-carbon-neutral-city-in-the-uk","story":"GLASGOW has launched an ambitious but credible drive to become the UKrsquos first carbon neutral city."},{"url":null,"title":"vandalised-cables-causing-travel-nightmare-for-scotrail-passengers","story":"VANDALISM of overhead railway cables at Woodhall is causing disruption to trains between Gourock   Wemyss Bay and Paisley Gilmour Street."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-travel-rail-passengers-suspended-due-to-signalling-fault","story":"RAIL passengers travelling on the Glasgow to East Kilbride line are being warned to expect delays and disruption due to a major signalling fault."},{"url":null,"title":"churches-urged-to-go-contactless-to-help-boost-collection-plate-donations","story":"Church of Scotland congregations are being encouraged to introduce a contactless collection payment system ."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-labour-msp-proposes-rent-caps-to-curb-power-of-city-landlords","story":"A GLASGOW woman has said she developed ldquoserious mental health issues because of the pressures of the increasing rent costs of her South Side home following the death of her husband."},{"url":null,"title":"new-scotrail-timetable-changes-set-to-come-into-force","story":"NEW ScotRail timetable changes set to come into force this weekendwill add thousands of extra seats for customers, says the train provider."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-sikh-community-given-dedicated-spot-to-scatter-loved-ones-ashes-on-port-glasgow-coast","story":"The Sikh community in Scotland has been given the first official spot to scatter ashes in a funeral ritual traditionally carried out on the Ganges -

The fan-funding scheme AberDNA has raised almost £, in net proceeds that are % allocated to McInnes’ football budget.Milne said: “What we have achieved in the last six years has given us a real  to see how we can take the club on to the next stage.“The success we have delivered out on the pitch and also things we achieved behind the scenes – increasing turnover, eliminating the debt and all the new initiatives that have been launched.“They have generated revenues with the bulk of it fed into football operations.“The training facilities will serve a purpose for the Community trust and the wider community as well.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/15351215.jpg ","title":"milne sure boss happy to stay put and say no to scotland","story":"Chairman Stewart Milne is confident manager Derek McInnes would reject any bid from the SFA to land him as the new Scotland manager.Aberdeen are braced for any potential approach from the SFA to talk to McInnes who is understood to be on a short-list now whittled down to just two candidates- with Kilmarnock’s Steve Clarke the other.Milne foresees a bright future at debt-free Aberdeen with a £ million training complex set for completion this year and a £m stadium on the horizon.On a day where Milne outlined the club’s strategy ahead of a move to Kingsford he was confident McInnes, who is set to go out of contract next summer, will remain at the club to drive it to the next level.Such is the close relationship between Milne and McInnes they have openly discussed the possibility of the Scotland position.Although he would love to manage his country one day the -year-old has reassured the Dons chairman he views his future not just in day-to-day club management, but at Aberdeen.Milne said: “We know Derek has been linked with the Scotland job and we speak about it very openly. Derek would love to be the national team coach one day.“However, from the discussions I have had with Derek he sees a big dference in the role of a national manager compared to a club manager.“And for this next stage of his career he wants to retain that day-to-day involvement.“Derek believes he has taken the club a long way and that he also equally believes he can help take the club to the next level.“I am confident that Derek will see the next stage of his career remaining at Pittodrie. However, that is a decision that only Derek can make at the end of the day.”The SFA are set to ramp up their search for a new manager following Sunday’s final round of Premiership top-six fixtures.With Euro qualiers looming against Cyprus on June  and Belgium three days later, time is of the essence to appoint a successor to McLeish.A squad for those Euro qualiers is scheduled to be named around May .Despite Milne’s confidence it is understood McInnes is still being considered by the SFA. With a year left on his Dons deal it is believed the SFA would have to stump up around £, in compensation #McInnes was open to the job.Should the SFA make an official approach would the Dons allow McInnes to talk to the governing body “We probably would,” said Milne. We will have to wait and see, Derek is an ambitious guy.“We have always said to him since the time he joined the club thatthere is a bigger job out there that he gets the opportunity to be considered for we would be prepared to sit down and discuss it through with him.“That is the sort of relationship that we have, that these sort of things can be spoken about openly.“We will do all we can, as we have in the past, to keep him here because we know how important Derek is to the club.“But at the end of the dayDerek decided there is another job out there he wanted to do we would obviously consider it.”In the six years since McInnes arrived at Pittodrie the Dons have won the League Cup and played in four finals and eight semis.The Reds have finished runners-up to Celtic over four straight seasons although that ended this year as they are in a battle with Killie for third.Aberdeen are pushing for a sixth straight European qualication. Annual turnover has doubled from £.m to £.m.That success does not go unnoticed.McInnes has previously rejected bids from Rangers and Sunderland to make him their new manager. With his deal, and that of his assistant Tony Docherty, set to run out after next season, McInnes recently confirmed to the Evening Express that he would be keen to open up contract talks with Aberdeen.Milne confirmed they have now opened up talks with the -year-old.He said: “We have started off the discussion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 06","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIn some ways it is like Groundhog Day, but yet again we are looking at severe cuts in health and social care services.At last week#s Kilmory meeting of the board in charge of these services # see page  # there was frustration at the pace at which these proposed cuts are being brought to the table.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week we have learned how CCTV has helped detected a serious crime in one Borders town.ldquoThis motion follows a refusal of the councilrsquos chief executive to allow the original report to be procedurally

for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes for fear of their safety.ldquoTherefore, I want to congratulate Police Scotland on raising awareness and educating drivers so that they are unlikely to reoffend.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cycle-planned-as-part-of-georges-legacy","story":"SIX months after a fatal accident cut the le short of a popular Melrose student, his family have formed a new

Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  My clothes have few outings and get a great innings","story":"Such a scene could bring a tear to the eye of anyone who has ever been forced to bid farewell to an outfit as dear to them as their next of kin. It would also cheer the model and fashionista Eunice Olumide who, among other things, campaigns for sustainability in her industry. After her talk last weekend at the Boswell Book Festival at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, I heard she had encouraged her audience to wear their clothes at least  times before discarding them. Not for her a one-night stand with ball-gown or palazzo pants. Clothes are not just for Christmas, they are something with which to establish a relationship.At least one of her listeners was already on message. The journalist chairing Olumidersquos event was wearing a -year-old suit, which looked asshe had picked it off the shop peg that morning. Putting aside the fact that a lot of us would struggle to squeeze into something wersquod owned for so long, it was a timely reminder that while the extremes of fashion outlive their best-before date faster than a camembert, the finest clothes are timeless.If you are already thinking  outings is the least yoursquod expect, chances are you could not be called a peacock or bird of paradise. Most likely you are one of those thirled to a self-imposed unorm, be it office suit or jeans. Sadly, I am of that persuasion. When getting dressed I rarely dig below the topsoil or forage beyond the most easily-reached hangars or shoes. Clearly it was for people of this nature that Harris Tweed was invented. Thanks to Hebridean looms, the idea of buying something that will ldquosee me out still flourishes in certain quarters. Years ago, when my husband interviewed Jackie Collins ndash who was resplendent in scarlet-zipped jumpsuit ndash she took one look at his elbow-patched Harris Tweed jacket, by then approaching its st birthday, and said: ldquoThis is some kind of joke, right It would be nice to claim that the narrow field from which I select garments is an environmental and political statement, but that would be misleading. My wardrobe is a sorry depository, most of its contents languishing forgotten and unloved for years on end. Like half the population Irsquoll wear underwear until the elastic frays, but dressier items can lie in cold storage for months while I get used to their presence. One such purchase, a snazzy woollen jersey bought before Christmas, is folded in a protective bag, awaiting the clocks turning back this autumn.

Either that, or a reluctant shopper. While I can admire beautul clothes and those who wear them, I loathe trying things on. I do have one or two lovely pieces, but they are usually bought on a whim, often on holiday, when I am window-shopping at ease. Back home, on the high street, I find the deed has to be done on the SAS principle of going in under cover, and getting out at top speed before anyone spots me and advances to offer help. In terms of potential misery, the idea of hiring a personal shopper for a couple of hours is up there with volunteering to visit Mars. You might think online purchasing is the answer, but thatrsquos about as effective as trying to hit a bulls-eye blindfolded.The advent of Snapchat and Instagram seems to have accelerated the trend of disposable fashion, especially in those with serious social lives. Yet when newspapers trumpet the reappearance of celebritiesrsquo previously-worn garb, what hope for the notion that itrsquos the person inside, not the costume itself, that matters  Changing attitudes to clothes, and their purpose, is the real challenge here.The biggest culprit in most wardrobes is the statement piece, bought for a special occasion, that has done service only once or twice. Even when borrowed by friends, itrsquos lucky to have five wears, let alone . To address this problem there are, of course, places that hire out occasion wear. Yet they are not a cure-all.

Even then, Dame Carolyn paid tribute to the showrsquos ldquodedicated production team and said the channel would continue to work with Kyle on ldquoother projects.Kyle show to go off airJust as newspapers took far too long to spot the iceberg marked ldquophone hacking, so it will take time for broadcasters to fully appreciate the implications of what has happened this week. Mr Dymondrsquos death was shocking enough. That it should be the fourth to be linked to a programme is appalling. Previously, two former contestants on ITVrsquos Love Island were found dead, plus one of their partners.Given the tin-eared response to previous warnings that no good would come from exploiting vulnerable people for the sake of ratings, one wonderseven now the message is finally getting through. After all, ITV has pulled the plug on Jeremy Kyle, but Love Island is expected tosoon and the show has been signed up for the next five years. Anyone would think the record ratings for the ITV show were clouding executivesrsquo judgement.Lest there is any doubt about it: telly is not supposed to result in people dying. It is meant to be entertainment. A bit of fun. Yet in the blink of an eye we have gone from The Truman Show to Black Mirror. How Programme has previousIt did not happen overnight. Reality programming has largely been an import from the US. It was American broadcasters who first realised that lots of cheap television could be had by putting their own viewers to work. People are interested in people, after all. So it began some  years ago with what now looks like the soft stuff, The Jerry Springer Show. Society was so appalled by its mix of violence and sleazy subject matter two bods wrote an opera about it. That would show lsquoem.But the pit got deeper. As more channels arrived and competition for the ad bucks intensied, broadcasters went in search of ever more sensational ways to pull in viewers while spending as little as possible. The drip, drip, drip of tawdriness became a torrent. It was not enough to have rumours of a romance between contestants on a reality show viewers had to see them having sex. Hosts could not simply put one side of an argument against another someone had to take a lie detector test . The stakes grew ever higher, the standards lower. Even when the first suicide occurred last year there was much murmuring about the need to take proper care of participants. If it had been animals being treated like this there would have been justied outrage and action taken immediately.So why was nothing done  It is no accident that the participants in such shows are by and large from working class, disadvantaged backgrounds. Appearing on a reality show has become the equivalent of boxing, football, and joining the Army ndash it is a ticket out.The Jeremy Kyle Show had a keen appreciation of class and vulnerability. Its researchers recruited from the poor, unemployed, and educationally disadvantaged. The show paraded them and mocked them to make the million plus viewers at home feel superior. Here was David Cameronrsquos ldquoBroken Britain laid out for all to see. These people did not merit compassion they deserved benefit sanctions and all the austerity the Conservative Government could dish out.Participants ndash letrsquos cut straight to it and call them victims ndash were vulnerable in other ways. Mentally ill people were meat and drink to ambitious young men and women in broadcasting, there to be eaten up and spat out. Depressed, anxious, grieving, desperate, lonely, struggling: sign up here. Both the BBC and Channel  have run programmes about people who hoard things. At first they did so in a purely exploitative, ldquolook at the state of that way. This was despite experts in the field telling them that such behaviour was a sign of mental illness. Broadcasters still make the shows, but now they frame them as pseudo therapy which ldquoshines a spotlight on the condition. Telly folk love a spotlight, unless it is on themselves.At least television noticed mentally ill people. Until relatively recently the rest of society largely ignored them or medicated the problem into the margins. It is a further disgrace that some people have come forward to say they only went on such shows to get help, perhaps for an addiction, because it was not available from the state. How much help,any, did people receive  Programme makers pointed to after care this and welfare that, but it always sounded like so much insurance against possible future claims. Claims that never came because, well, the poor and mentally ill donrsquot tend to use lawyers .Tempting as it is to lay most of the blame on the wretched likes of Jeremy Kyle and company, it is no accident that television has sunk to such depths just as standards of behaviour in general have fallen. People have become more abusive and less tolerant. Twitter is an open sewer at times. Leavers and Remainers snarl at each other outside the Commons. Inside, MPs do the same. Confrontation is king.I would like to believe that the deaths of Mr Dymond and others represent a watershed moment for broadcasting, but then television reflects the society it serves. If it can happen ldquoout there it can happen on the box. As long as we continue to be cruel or uncaring to the weak and vulnerable, television will do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"irn-bru-to-launch-new-energy-drink","story":"Barrs have announced the launch of IRN-BRU Energy, anew energy drink that will hit shelves from  July .The brand-new formula will combine the iconic flavour of IRN-BRUrsquos top secret essence with the taurine, caffeine, B vitamins and taste of an energy drink.Most details are being kept strictly under wraps until its official launch on  July, but Barrs have saidthat IRN-BRU Energy willmeet the needs of todayrsquos energy drinker and will offer a dferent taste experience to regular IRN-BRU.Adrian Troy, marketing director at A.G.

Possibly a power tool or an electric light but, generally, a lot of the tools and skills are the same.

She said: ldquoI make designs that are location-specic ndash coastlines, skylines and landscapes ndash and will be showing some Edinburgh-based pieces, including rings with the Edinburgh coastline and city skyline, and a large statement necklace which has the coastline map of Edinburgh flowing through the necklace elements.Designer Akvile Su says that rather than having separate collections for men and women her work is for anyone to wear. Indeed, it often raises questions about gender, sexuality, jewellery and the body.She said: ldquoIt seems very outdated to meto view items of jewellery as feminine or masculine ndash Irsquom a woman, but I tend to like bigger and more sculptural pieces.

Itrsquos someone who pushes you to come on holiday. Itrsquos someone who Likes your Facebook post, evenitrsquos not that funny. Itrsquos someone you once had a relationship with, and even though that didnrsquot work out, still wants to connect because it would be crazy not to.A friend is someone who takes your calls after curfew time, who listens to your saddest tale even when it involves someone whorsquos not their friend, and is prepared to ask all the right questions.A friend is someone who shares their own traumas, asks for your thoughts. A friend is someone who can make you a better version of yourself, because they know you better than you do. A friend is someone who could put a trained psychotherapist out of a job.Friends are the Tom Sawyer to your Huckleberry Finn. Theyrsquore Butch to your Sundance, someone who will grab your hand when you go off the clf, or when facing lersquos Mexican guns are still making plans to go to Australia. Friends are a reminder one is a question, two an answer.But they are also vital to our physical health. Dr Lauren Brent, an evolutionary biologist and professor at the University of Exeter writes that interactions can extend le expectancy and lower chances of heart disease. ldquoWhen we interact the neurobiological endogenous opioid system [the stuff in our brains that make us feel good] kicks in.She explains wersquove long needed friends to help us with social navigation, to tell us where good hunting is to be had, berries are to be found, enemies can be avoided.Frankie Boyle came up with a nice line which underlines the value of friendship: ldquoOur greatest fear is to die alone, which is why I intend to take quite a few people with me.But we wonrsquot always get the chance to shuffle off at the same time as our pals. We may think friends will be with us forever, or at least until it comes time to book the mini-bus to take us to the Lost Cause care home, but thatrsquos not the case.

It also firmly established the ethos still at the heart of Scottish education that simply passing exams is not the same as learning.We live in a country that doesnrsquot just place empPastehasis on the retention of facts, our curriculum was specically designed to ensure our young people become four things: successful learners, confident iniduals, responsible citizens and effective contributors.I am not aware of anyone who disagrees with these ambitions and I canrsquot fathom why anyone would.Last year a record proportion of young people went on to positive destinations including work, training or further study.In addition, the gap between the most and least deprived communities for young people entering work, training or further study is half what it was in  . A higher proportion of students from our most deprived areas successfully completed college courses last year and a record number of students from the most disadvantaged areas gained a place at university last year.Under the previous system S marked the end of a phase of learning with a focus on ensuring young people gained as many Standard Grades as possible.: Teachers warn subject squeeze now hitting HighersIt had little flexibility and was more often than not based on a fairly set route of progression from Standard Grade, to Higher, to Advanced Higher.Now S is the start of a new phase of learning which aims to deliver the highest levels of attainment possible. In some schools, young people can choose to study Highers over two years and completely miss out Nat  and Nat  levels altogether.It is entirely up to schools and local authorities to decide the best approach for their learners and this will inevitably lead to dferent approaches ndash that ersity should be seen and celebrated as a strength.We have to move the debate away from focusing solely on qualications. We need to make it clear that university is a great achievement but it is equally a moment of celebrationsomeone goes to college, gets a modern apprenticeship or enters the world of work.Through increased collaboration between industry and education, the routes and options into employment available to young people are the most erse they have ever been and the uptake in vocational qualications has increased substantially year on year.: Narrowing of curriculum putting education at riskFor our young people there is no wrong path to their career of choice and it is the job of everyone working within education to help them get there.I regularly see schools across the country working closely with colleges, youth work and employers to ensure that young peoplesrsquo learning is relevant to their future learning and career pathways.So, we must focus on ensuring that Curriculum for Excellence is delivering in a way that meets the needs of Scotlandrsquos learners."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-a-hot-tip-for-the-bbc","story":"THE BBC reported that Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has called for more television comedy shows to have references to climate change in order to tackle the issue. \"Good news,\" says a reader. \"Im looking forward to the resurrection of It Aint Half Hot Mum.\"Close encountersSOME of our stories abut the Glasgow Subway have referred to its diminutive size.

I believe, however, that this relationship is not the only issue at stake.It looks asan organisation calling itself the Brexit Party may get the most votes in the UKand win one seat out of six in Scotland. This organisation, which is in fact a private company controlled by Nigel Farage, is a profound threat to our democracy. It has no members and has issued no manesto. It lives only by propagating the lie that our democratically-elected Parliament has stopped Brexit whereas this was done by extreme Brexiters like Mr Farage. It wants to import the corrupt and isive politics of Trumpism to Britain. It intends to use its seats in the European Parliament to start an economic war against the EU which will cost many jobs and cut living standards in Scotland.This grouping has not campaigned in Scotland. Its only sign of interest in our country has been the call of one of its candidates for the abolition of the Scottish Parliament. Yet polling shows it has a good chance of winning one of our seats in the European Parliament. If it does Mr Farage will claim that his poisonous and dishonest politics have some support here.Many people will want to use their vote to thwart him. There are several parties offering positive and constructive policies on our future including the chance for us to have a final say on our relationship with Europe.The voting system means that the votes for parties that get less than about  per cent are lost. Currently polls say the Greens, LibDems and Change UK are on about six per cent each so their combined vote would defeat Mr Farage but inidually will not. The Liberal Democrats are rising in national polls so may have the best chance of taking the ldquoBrexit Party seat and they are solidly in favour of the democratic necessity of a proper vote on any Brexit deal. They are worth considering.The only way to defeat extremists like Mr Farage is to show the vitality of our democratic system. Please vote on the rd.Keith Macdonald,Glasgow G.PROFESSOR Sir John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, has stated that the SNP is on course to win three and possibly four seats out of six at next weeks European elections. This will come as no surprise to those who have been talking to voters on the doorsteps, and would have sent a chill running up the spines of the Unionist partiestheyd possessed any. The Conservative Party in particular is looking down the barrel of one opinion poll which suggests that its support is at a risible  per cent.They have all brought it on their own heads and far be it from me to offer succour to the Unionist parties, but I would suggest that one way of improving their prospects would be to demand that the overwhelming Remain vote in Scotland at the EU referendum be honoured and as the SNP looks set to win more than  per cent of the vote on May , clearly independence within the EU is a more attractive prospect to the electorate than going down with the Westminster ship. However,the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties really cannot bring themselves to support putting Scotlands future into Scotlands hands, they should stop sticking \"Scottish\" in front of their parties names they are embarrassing themselves, and they are certainly an embarrassment to Scotland.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THERE is a particularly sharp focus on the upcoming EU elections for voters in Scotland. It has been generated by the relentlessly exclusive manner in which the UK government at Westminster has conducted Brexit negotiations.Scotland is comparable to Austria in area, to Denmark in population and few now argue it could not be an independent European country. Objective comparisons show independence can open a path to enhanced prosperity while moving towards a more equitable society ndash potentially beneficial to neighbouring countries too.There is an opportunity in the EU elections on May  for voters in Scotland to give a decisive signal about their aspirations: subservience or independence ndash the choice is in sharp focus.Bruce Crichton,Hamilton.HAVING received election leaflets from all political parties, todayrsquos from the Conservative Party takes the biscuit. The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon feature so many times I have lost count. When I looked for their policies, again: one, Nicola Sturgeon, then two, respect the EU election result, although Scotland voted to remain in every constituency, in total more than  per cent, and three, help secure a sensible Brexit that works for Scotland I also wonder what John Dunlopis trying to convey, is he under the impression the SNP is the only party spending money on election leaflets By the way, I am not a member of any political party.Rosemarie Lang,Douglas.IN James Robbrsquos letter today , he has two Tory parties in Scotland, Unionist and Conservative.

In this ldquoDavidson Tory Party you can advocate any policy: anti-Brexit, pro-Brexit, pro-indyref then anti-indyref and like the Toon clock, you will eventually have a face to suit everyone.

Among the first of the major economies to pledge to complete a journey that every country must eventually make.This is the moment for maximum international influence ndash every country is now contemplating its responsibilities under the global climate accord signed in Paris a few years ago.Scotland already has a special record, thanks to its willingness to embrace renewable energy.

That asks a lot of governments in Edinburgh and London, who havenrsquot always been well-coordinated. Iniduals have a role too.

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations. It will feature many of the ordinary people who have had an impact on the Parliament during its -year history. Ken said: “We are always trying to find new ways of engaging with the public and, in many ways, that’s what the exhibition and the th anniversary is all about.”The community and engagement unit is also trying to track down the babies who were born on July , .The youngsters share their birthday with the Parliament and were a big part of the th anniversary. The hope is that they can all be reunited on Saturday, June , for the th birthday party.For more information on events, visit www.parliament.scot.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their teacher, Inga Falconer, feels that the children have benefited immensely from the project.#What we have looked at has been communication during World War Two,# she explained.#Britt came in with lots of creative skills — writing and lots of dferent types of drawing. We have also worked with other folk in the community.#They have thoroughly enjoyed the project. It has been a really rich learning experience for them — they have enjoyed meeting dferent folk in the community and I think that#s a really valuable way to learn.#Pupils Charlie Scottand Connor MacKenziespoke about their favourite parts of the project.#I quite liked doing all the research, and having Sandy Firth come in to tell us stories,# said Connor.Charlie added: #I really enjoyed going to Radio Orkney and when Sandy Firth came in too.#Both said they were also looking forward to taking their book and its stories on tour to some of Orkney#s residential care homes. This is the second year that Britt Harcus has helped guide this KTHI project. She took the opportunity to thank those who had helped make it possible.#The KTHI need a big thank you for their funding,# she said.#Without them, this project would simply not have happened. #Sandy Firth, who came to visit the bairns and has been a great source of knowledge and inspiration for the class. I think it#s important that wartime stories and memories are passed on and not forgotten.#Kim and Robert Foden also deserve a special mention for their help in this project as well as Dave Gray at Radio Orkney.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A number of staffers have made complaints about bullying in your office. Do you a react with dignity, respect for due process, and confidence in your exoneration or b have an ongoing, very public reaction on social media rallying support over several days Now imagine you were a worker, considering reporting a superior. You have witnessed high-profile Twitter users publicly backing those facing complaints, engaging with suggestions of smears. Extremely visible, well-connected judgement of private workplace matters is unlikely to encourage that person to come forward. In any normal office, it would be deeply inappropriate to take a stance on a dispute. Politics is an unusual environment, but when it comes to staff treatment and procedural resources, there should be no lowering of standards.Last week, news emerged that four former staff members of Joanna Cherry’s office have raised claims of bullying, subsequently spreading online like a rash.In a statement to the Sunday National, Cherry said: “It is not for SNP employees, paid for by the party or parliamentary staff paid for by the public purse to take to Twitter to air their grievances or to go to the newspapers. They should use proper procedures and behave in a professional fashion.” She added: “I am confident I will survive the attempts to smear my reputation.”It should go without saying like any other workplace dispute, nobody not directly involved really knows what the situation is. Not other politicians and not the public. Not you, and not I. It’s not for public judgement, but for House of Commons inquiry. In the spirit of fairness, healthy workplace culture and general common sense, some politicians weighing in might have voiced views more responsibly. No matter how close to the accused, or what the outcome will be, prematurely declaring sides is not only foolish but deeply disrespecting of iniduals’ right to seek recourse against those in positions of superiority.“It’s like the Crucible,” a source declared, referencing the witch trial play beloved by amateur dramatic societies. Really  When it comes to letting workplace human resources grievance inquiries run their course, not at all.: Nicola Sturgeon under fire for ‘the wrong call’ in SNP bullying rowA “we stand with Joanna Cherry” graphic floats around as though this were campaign season, and not for looming European elections, an important moment for the party to brandish pro-EU credentials.Some have disappointing lack of judgement in a rush to engage. Speculation runs rampant that complaints are linked to any number of enemy factors, among them state interference, internal jealousy, retaliation for Cherry speaking on the Gender Reform Act , or more vaguely, “speaking up for women”. Cherry recently received police protection after facing online abuse. But it seems unhelpful to conflate the incident with a workplace complaint. Mixed messages, to say the least.The GRA discussion is notably isive with history of attracting extremists. What it needs now is de-escalation. Cherry was one of several signatories of a related open letter, published in days leading up to the SNP spring conference. If the ethics weren’t enough of a reason to build consensus, ision isn’t very good for political parties either: it’s often taken advantage of by opportunists seeking emotive sway, and who would benefit from that Inverclyde councillor Chris McEleny has often been quick off the mark to back Cherry’s statements, intriguingly declaring himself in a tweet to be “for women”. He did not respond to my questions on how being “for women” is compatible with the explicitly anti-abortion letter from the Bishop’s Conference of Scotland he published on his blog in , describing laws permitting abortion as “profoundly unjust”, a human rights violation that should be opposed and changed. Groups including Catholics for Choice have criticised anti-abortion attitudes in the church.But while many seem convinced the workplace inquiry is linked to recent public comment on the GRA, workplace complaints appear to have been made months prior. Conflating an inidual’s workplace dispute with women’s rights does little to advance clarity on a subject already mired in toxicity.: SNP MP Joanna Cherry says ‘bully’ claim may be part of smearing by own partyOther figures tweeting support for Cherry this week include Tommy Sheridan, Craig Murray, and Wings Over Scotland. Politics via social media can be surprisingly unsubtle. “Let’s get behind her, let’s get together, and let’s move forward towards our independence,” banged Chris McEleny on the big thick drum of support, which also sounded in his blog critiquing press coverage of sexual assault claims against the former SNP leader, entitled “The Monstering of Alex Salmond”. McEleny also tweeted “#Trending in Scotland: @joannaccherry. Lesson: Positive rhetoric always beats negative smears.” Successful poker players often keep cards close to their chest.Among tweets of support Cherry has herself ‘liked’ are those suggesting she would be a great leader, and critiquing current leadership.Holding court in the petty kingdom of social media is one thing, but what qualities come to mind when considering leadership, particularly a national role with international resonance  Wisdom  Perspective  Rising to the top of a political party requires growing deep roots of support what comes after that is winning over the country. Nicola Sturgeon’s recent conference speech included the lines: “We must always make our case with the decency, respect and dignity that we want to be the hallmark of our independent country. I am acutely aware of the responsibility of all politicians, especially leaders, to bring people together not drive them apart.” It’s an approach that has won her admirers much further afield than Scotland, and helped turn the role of First Minister of Scotland into one with global recognition.Sturgeon responded to a reporter question about the Cherry situation, by saying “where complaints are brought forward against any parliamentarian it’s important that they’re properly considered - but that should happen under due process and not in the pages of the media”, adding her focus was on the forthcoming European elections. After days of noise online, it felt like an adult had walked into the room. In an era of populist table-banging and media manipulation, tact and maturity in public conduct are more appealing than ever, particularly as a supporter of Scottish independence while Brexit looms.If a groundswell for a party leader has ever emerged in tandem with an HR dispute it hasn’t stuck in the memory. Leaders in any field inevitably weather a few storms before rising to the top putting in time brings with it perspective on interpersonal tussles. Savvy politicians in it for the long run might wait for things to blow over when facing a human resources crisis. It’s rather unedying to see some comb social media for any favourable mention after staff complaints, no matter how muddled or how far they have drted from reality.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit top labour candidate says staying in the eu is non negotiable","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labours top candidate in Scotland for next week#s#European elections and more than half of the partys Scottish MPs have said staying in the EU is \"non-negotiable\" in a direct challenge to their leadership at Westminster.In an open letter to voters, David Martin MEP, who leads the Labour list in Scotland, said a confirmatory referendum on any Brexit deal agreed by Westminster was the only way to deliver on Jeremy Corbyns aims of a fairer, greener UK and Europe.And it calls on Labour to embrace the manesto put out by the European socialist group, suggesting that MEPs elected on  May could sit in the European Parliament \"potentially for the next five years.\": Farage’s Brexit Party charges £. to attend Edinburgh rallyThe MPs Ian Murray, Martin Whitfield, Ged Killen and shadow Scotland minister Paul Sweeney have also signed the letter, as well as fellow European election candidate Callum ODwyer.It comes amid uncertainty over Labours stance on cross-party Brexit talks with Theresa Mays government, which are set to continue, and whether the opposition will follow through on demands from members and scores of MPs to seek a second EU referendum.While Labours deputy leader Tom Watson has said Labour is a \"remain and reform\" party, senior figures on Mr Corbyns front bench have continued to insist Labour will deliver Brexit.\"As elected politicians we firmly believe that it is in the UK and Scotland’s best interest to continue to play an integral role at the heart of the European union.That is why the European Elections are so important,\" the letter states.\"There is no doubt that the overriding issue at the moment is Brexit, but we must also be mindful as voters that we are electing our representatives in the European Parliament potentially for the next five years.\"We are very proud of the manesto produced by the European wide Party of European Socialistgrouping of which the Scottish and UK Labour Party MEPs are the only members from the UK affiliated.\"The letter goes on to highlight Europe-wide proposals to force multinationals like Google, Amazon and Facebook to pay their fair share in tax, close the gender pay gap, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and protect consumer rights.: Theresa May’s Brexit deal is ‘dead’MPs say no again\"Of course, this socialist group manesto can only be delivered and benefit Scottish citizens by both electing socialist group MEPs through the Labour Party AND remaining in the EU,\" the letter states.\"We believe that remaining in the EU is non-negotiable and we will help deliver that through a public confirmatory vote on any deal agreed by parliament, to give you a final say.That is putting the national interest first and foremost.\"We believe in a public vote to allow revocation, renewal and reform.

UKIP with theirTommy thug is a nonsence, as for May, lets leave that for gathering nuts!!!Forgive meI am wrong here but did not the SNP campaign most vigorously during the Independence Campaign to take Scotland out of the United Kingdom and that would have resulted in Scotland no longer being in the European Union. Is this woman being disingenuous or is she just plain stupid  Does she really believe our memories are so short  Just why would anyone follow the SNP  Nicola Sturgeon being investigated under her own Ministerial code for her handling of the Salmond allegations and nothing at all can further legally be said. I think no messages need be said to May from the SNP, perhaps Farage would put the message across with a lot more credibility.#Scotland#s future lies in Europe.# LOL. They never stop, do they, no matter how often it#s pointed out that IndyScotland will be automatically out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on the same day that we leave the UK.This has been officially confirmed to the both the House of Lords and the Scottish Parliament by EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barrosoand his deputy Viviane Reding , respectively.It seems the SNP will also #drag Scots out of the EU#,they get their way with independence.I#ve just had a letter from Willie Rennie. He thinks the Scottish elections are on  May!Ian smears Nicola Sturgeon then claims“nothing further legally can be said” in his latest charm offensive. Apparently the ancient legal maxim innocent-until-proven-guilty doesn’t apply to women he judges “disengenuous or just plain stupid”.Ian must love his prejudices dearly to flaunt them in such unapologetically intolerant and illiberal clothes. Was he always so delightful Brexit, in short, is nothing more than the Tories wanting to disconnect the UK from the EU, and connect itself directly to the USA, purely for themto benefit from the privatising of most government responsibilities and duties of care to US companies.

Brexit, was nothing to do with the greater good for everybody, but for the few who would benefit####typical tory policy, # look after number , and screw everybody  in the process #, political ideology.*If* the Tories intent is to disconnect the UK from the EU and connect it directly to the USA, why is everything the government has put on the table so far and fought hard to sell to the nation as #Brexit#, proposals that will KEEP the nation well and truly in the EU in all but name, but on considerably worse terms than our current membership .."},{"url":null,"title":"various vacancies at shetland islands council ","story":"If you don’t have access to the internet or have a disability which prevents you from applying online, please call  .We are an Equal Opportunities Employer, and encourage Remote and Flexible Working."},{"url":null,"title":"crofters urged to submit single application forms by midnight on wednesday ","story":"Crofters and farmers in Shetland wanting to apply for subsidies are reminded that the deadline for submitting Single Application Formsis on Wednesday at midnight.The Scottish government is encouraging people to use the ruralpayments.org website to apply.Rural economy minister Fergus Ewing said: #The  Single Application Form deadline is a few days away and I would strongly urge farmers, crofters and land mangers across Shetland to submit their applications by th May.#For those who have yet to do so, it#s worth remembering it#s quicker and easier online.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

As we face into the new mandate it is high time to effectively deliver on the long-promised aspiration of Belfast as a ‘Diverse City of Equals’.The Gaeltacht Quarter Board has long engaged with Council but Council has failed, thus far, to break down the reluctance of some to embrace and promote the Gaeltacht Quarter as one of the vibrant, open and welcoming quarters of the city and as an asset for residents and tourists alike. Given the make-up of the new Council we would hope to see progress in this regard. Here are some points we would like you to consider.# Unionists are now the smallest combined voting block in Council# Unionists can only muster  votes# That is  votes short of a majority# Unionists can no longer block the aspiration for Belfast as a Diverse City of Equals# No-one now needs to do deals with unionists in Belfast to deliver for citizens in a non-partisan way# Parties can now develop and promote fair and equitable policies, which are Section  compliant, without needing to seek unionist approval or unionist votes# Parties can garner working majorities without allowing Alliance to play the role of arbiter# The combined Alliance and unionist vote is , two votes short of a majority# If parties continuedoing deals with unionism they must explainit is to deliver on voters’ aspirations or for other more expedient reasons.Combined Non-Unionist Strength with Alliance –  votes.Sinn Féin Alliance SDLP Greens People Before Profit Combined Non-Unionist Strength without Alliance  votes.Sinn Féin SDLP Greens People Before Profit "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christopher looks to the future at newington cu","story":"HAVING studied drama at Queen’s University, a younger Christopher McBride could hardly have imagined he would one day become a Director at Newington Credit Union.However, the -year-old accountant’s thespian ambitions exited the stage when he realised he “couldn’t do accents”. He good-humouredly reflects on his lack of accomplishment in that department as a skill he “kind of needed” to carve out a career in drama. Luckily, he has found both fulfilment and success not only in his day job in the finance industry, but also through his work at the local credit union.Christopher has been a lelong member of Newington Credit Union, which was founded in  by his grandfather, Sean Caughey. Since coming on board as a Director in December , Christopher has striven to make a dference in the local community like his grandfather before him.“My granddad founded the credit union so that the local community would have somewhere they could save money, where everyone could pool together their resources so thatpeople needed a loan then there would be that central community hub that they could use and that’s something we’re doing to this very day,” he said.“I feel the credit union is really important. When I was in England I spoke to people about the credit union model and they were amazed because they don’t have the same focus on credit unions.In the last few years we’ve seen the controversy theresurrounding payday loan companies with massive interest rates, but that might not have happenedthere were credit unions. People who would otherwise have gone to a payday lender can come to the credit union and get a rate where they won’t be exploited, which is very important. I wanted to be able to help the credit union by using my expertise in accountancy to help its development.“I’ve been involved with the monthly meetings where we look at how the credit union is progressing. It’s really to make sure that we are continuing to serve our purpose. I have started to get involved in the investment committee to look at what we are doing with our money. I’m also involved in trying to get more people to join the credit union. For me, it’s very important to get more people – especially young people – involved in the credit union.”During his short time as a Newington Credit Union Director, Christopher has overseen an upsurge in members following a highly successful recruitment drive in March – something he says he is “very proud of”. He is also spearheading the credit union’s efforts to bring in a erse range of volunteers to help develop the organisation.“I want to get more Directors on board,” he said. “I’m one of the younger directors on the board, so I want to get more people my age involved. It’s good to have people from a range of backgrounds and it’s a good way to get involved with the local community. I really wanted to improve the North Belfast area, it’s something that I’m quite passionate about, so getting on board has really helped me do that. A lot of people think thatthey don’t have a financial or business background that they can’t get involved, but that’s not the case.“I came from a drama background and became a director, so the only real qualication is that you want to help develop the Credit Union and the local community.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"church leaders meet stormont politicians","story":"LEADERS of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches in Ireland have held talks with Stormont parties in the latest attempt to break the political deadlock.British and Irish Ministers including Secretary of State Karen Bradley also attended the meeting on Tuesday.The delegation of church leaders told the Stormont parties it was time to demonstrate courageous political leadership.Archbishop Richard Clarke said: #One of the messages we tried to send today is that in a vacuum, other forces will move into that vacuum and take control of it.#And for that reason, there is this absolutely huge need to ensure that somehow, normal political le starts again.#Archbishop Eamon Martin added, “If we don’t sit around the table and talk, then what  ”Following the meeting, Sinn Féin leader in the north Michelle O’Neill said: “All of society has a stake in this process so we very much welcome the start of a broad engagement with wider society beginning with the church leaders that were at Stormont today and we thank them for their contribution.“We want to meet with a wide range of civic society, all the churches, the trade unions, business organisations, womens groups, language groups, the community and voluntary sector and everyone out there because this process and these institutions belong to us all.“These talks have the potential to restore the power-sharing institutions and that is the best way to ensure that the next generation benefits from the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.“We all know what the outstanding issues are. We believe they can and must be resolved so Sinn Féin will continue to engage in these talks with positivity and a determination to do the business.“None of the issues are insurmountable or unresolvable. Agreement can be reached and the institutions restored with the positive political will and support of all parties and both governments.“The way forward is through implementation of agreements already made, safeguarding rights enjoyed by citizens in the rest of Ireland and in Britain, and delivering good governance.”DUP leader Arlene Foster added, “Getting the Assembly back up and running immediately would be a courageous thing to do, a compassionate thing to do and the right thing to do.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"clonard rector prepares to bid farewell to parish like no other","story":"“I’M not going to Timbuktu, I’m going  miles down the road,” laughs Clonard Rector Fr Noel Kehoe, who is preparing to leave the West Belfast church for the latest chapter of his vocation in the parish of Dundalk.A familiar and popular face to the Clonard faithful – as well as to the tens of thousands who attend the annual Clonard Novena – Fr Kehoe has been Rector these past four years.“In our le as Redemptorists we help with the needs of the province,” he said. “I’ve never been based in Dundalk but it’s a church that I got to know growing up. Just as people come to the Clonard Novena, my family would have gone to the St Majella Novena every year over the generations, it’s a church that I know very well and love.”Fr Kehoe spoke of how there is great goodness in people “wherever you go” and how much he will miss the people he has got to know since first arriving at  Clonard Gardens in .“Clonard is very much inserted in this community, their pride and love for it is something I haven’t experienced anywhere .“People have the same struggles and dficulties. I will really miss Clonard, miss the people I got to know here. When the changes were published they were a bit of a shock.“Clonard is a church and faith community like no other. The people of Clonard are amazing, they are the most generous people I’ve ever met, they would literally go out of their way to help you in anyway they could.“I spent seven years in Cork learning to say things without actually saying them, when I came to Clonard there were no back doors. It was lovely to work with that, you knew where you stood with people.”While the sterling work of Fr Kehoe at Clonard is well appreciated by the local people, he is keen to point out that it takes a considerable team effort for Clonard to work.“I’m not sure people really understand just how big it is. There are over  people involved in Clonard, from our ministries, readers, Eucharist Ministers. Clonard has become a very signicant place for music and our director Cathal Murphy has really pushed that with our choirs and opening up Clonard as a venue for concerts.“Clonard’s name is out there, when you have such a beautul and sacred place at your disposal there are people coming to Clonard for music that may have never been before.”With preparations gathering pace for next month’s eagerly-awaited Novena, Fr Kehoe says he will take with him forever the “phenomenon” that the annual June festival of prayer has become.“You have -, people a day coming into the area. People are coming with huge burdens, you can see by the end that they are leaving feeling healed, supported and feeling that God is very close to them in their lives. I think at some stage all of us need that.Paying tribute to the faith of the people of Clonard, Fr Kehoe says he was amazed to find when he arrived at Clonard that there were three Christmas Vigil Masses.“I remember saying, ‘You can’t do that’ but it was a case of wait and see. Seeing the church packed with young families, seeing that sense of pure joy in the church, well, I will take that with me everywhere.“I have a real deep feeling of gratitude for the way people have welcomed me, the faith of West Belfast Catholics is second to none and I want to thank them for all their love and support.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eastwood optimistic at taking third euro seat","story":"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood says his party are in the “best position” to take a seat in the European Parliament.There are  candidates battling for seats in the north with sitting MEPs Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson and DUP’s Diane Dodds expected to win a seat following next Thursday’s election.A LuicdTalk poll, published by The Times, has predicted that Mr Eastwood would received more first preference votes than the UUP and Alliance in the fight for the final seat. On a visit to Lisburn’s city centre-based Atlas Women’s Centre, which is EU funded, Colum Eastwood told Daily Belfast that his party are “clearly in the best position to take that seat.”“We have had a fantastic response. We’ve set out to run a very positive pro-European anti-Brexit campaign because I think we have the most credibility in terms of being opposed to Brexit, opposed to the referendum happening. “We are unequivocal in our opposition to it. We think there is an opportunity to now send a very positive pro- European anti-Brexit message by electing two Remain MEPs and we think that’s key becausewe elected two Leavers that would be sending the wrong message as to what people in Northern Ireland think about Brexit.“It’s within our grasp. The was a poll a few weeks ago which had us in fourth position, there was a poll two days ago which put us in third position so out of all the good Remain candidates were are clearly in the best position to take that seat,” he said.He continued: “We want people to lend us their support, even just for this one election, to send a clear anti-Brexit message. People voted in  to Remain,  per cent. I think that numberit was tested again would be through the roof. People have watched the Brexit process unfold with horror they are deeply concerned about the impact it is going to have here, on our economy, our society, our peace process.

Another key moment saw her lay a wreath in the Garden of Remembrance for those who died in the fight for  independence from Britain.And in  the Queen shook hands with former IRA commander Mr McGuinness in a moment of historic signicance that would have been unimaginable during the Troubles. data-dfpadtargetingThe Prince of Wales shakes hands with Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly at Carlisle Memorial Church in Belfast where he is meeting the organisations involved in the regeneration of the building as a permanent home for the Ulster Orchestra.

The fate of the third seat, held by the retiring Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, is less certain.Speaking at the launch of the Alliance manesto at the CIYMS sports grounds in east Belfast yesterday, Mrs Long said her party is best placed to take that seat.The party manesto includes pledges to secure a peoples vote, keep borders open, protect the economy and support the work of the EU.Mrs Long said: \"The recent council election results, in addition with a number of polls and surveys, show Alliance is in prime position to not only substantially increase our number of first preference votes but also gain the required transfers from others to take the third seat and show the EU, and indeed the world, Northern Ireland wants to Remain.\"Brexit is not an orange or green issue and I am not an orange or green politician.\"In , people right across our community came together to vote Remain. I believe we can achieve better together and show that same spirit again on May .\"Mrs Long said she believes Northern Irelands third seat is going to come down to transfers, and urged voters totwo Remain candidates.\"In the recent polls that have been produced, we are literally within the margin of error, neck-and-neck with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,\" she said.\"The Ulster Unionists are the current incumbent, and its very clearwe are neck-and-neck with the current incumbent, we are in contention for that seat.\"Unlike the Ulster Unionists who are moving backwards, and the SDLP who have been drting backwards, we have forward momentum, so the opportunity is there for us to attract crucial transfers because that is what will decide the last seat, not just the first preference votes but how many transfers we can draw from across the board,\" she said.\"Thats why I am encouraging people who vote Alliance to vote for other pro-remain candidates after they have voted Alliance number one, and I would hope that other pro-Remain candidates will want to do the same.\"Its important we have two voices in Europe who are pro-Remain, who are making a strong statement to government about how Northern Ireland feels about the EU,\" the Alliance leader said.\"But I believe it is also important that we have a voice there that is not simply a unionist or nationalist voice, that doesnt further polarise this issue but that can represent the broad swathe of public opinion and civic society. And I believe I am best placed to do that.\"Alliance’s key manesto prioritiesReinforcing progressive values. Alliance said it believes in “strength through ersity, respecting people, enabling opportunities, protecting rights and inclusion”.Supporting work of the EU. The manesto states Northern Ireland’s participation in the EU brings huge advantages.Protecting our economy. It says the Customs Union and Single Market “provide massive economic opportunities to our manufacturing, agri-food and service sectors”.Keeping open borders. Alliance believes any form of Brexit risks new isions and barriers, adding: “We must keep the open borders throughout these islands, and preserve everyone’s freedom to trade and live their lives freely.” Securing a people’s vote. Alliance wants a fresh referendum, with Remain on the ballot.

We are Euro critical, we know that farmers, business, ordinary people will be injured and harmed by Brexit. \"Those are the facts.\"The bare minimum protections that Ireland requires are contained in the backstop - there can be no backsliding from that.\"Ms McDonald added that she believes that voters have the opportunity to send out a clear message to the Conservative Government.\"This really is the election campaign that the Tories didnt want to happen,\" the Sinn Fein leader insisted.\"Martina Anderson really is the person that the Tories wish was not on posters anywhere. This is a moment for all of us to take a stand. \"I dont believe this is a moment for us all to retreat into fear or old tribal rivalries. This is a time to look to the future.\"There is no credible case to be made for Brexit. \"It is extremely dangerous for our peace process and agreements.\"A vote for Martina says Ireland will not be collateral damage to the reckless Tory Brexit.\"No MEP has defended the Irish case in the way that Martina has. \"There are many people across the parliament and institutions in Europe who would tell you likewise. \"People have to scrutinise the position adopted by candidates very carefully. \"I dont think people should be speaking out of both sides of their mouths on the issue of Brexit.\"Ms Anderson told the audience that no other party has fought harder for Ireland over the past five years, particularly over Brexit issues.\"There would not be a backstopit hadnt been for Sinn Fein,\" she said.\"We brought the focus and attention to Ireland, demonstrating the damage it was going to do to our country, particularly to those of us who live in the north.\"Brexit belongs to the Tories, the Good Friday Agreement belongs to us.\"We secured that the Good Friday Agreement needed to be protected in all of its parts, that there would be no hardening of the Irish border.\"Mrs ONeill added that Ireland was \"at best and as ever an afterthought in the minds of the British Establishment\" when negotiating the Brexit deal.\"Since  Sinn Fein has campaigned vigorously on the idea of special status for the North, a policy the SDLP, Alliance Party and Green Party have now adopted.\"We cannot withstand exclusion from the customs union or the single market.\"Team Sinn Fein brought Irish issues to the heart of Europe. \"We have stood up to the DUP and the British Government. \"Irish unity is now firmly on the agenda in Europe.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irelands sarah mcternan to make eurovision debut in second semifinal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Balmoral ShowNorth West NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Therersquos a team of around  of us at the practice and they are all brilliant.While Jane collected the Young Clinician of The Year award, one of the most sought-after accolades in Scottish dentistry, her practice was also shortlisted for the dental team of the year award, narrowly missing out on the night.A major part of Janersquos success is her ability to reassure young children and other nervous patients.She says that half are affected by previous poor experiences where, while the other % simply have an irrational fear.She said: ldquoWith kids I want to do anything I can to put them at ease so that in the future they will always see visiting the dentist as a positive experience.ldquoI will do whatever it takes, eventhat means having a tea party on the floor to persuade a child to hop into the seat. And Irsquove lost count of the number of treatments Irsquove performed on teddies.Elsewhere, Jane has also become the go-to dentist in the Highlands for working with autistic children after her name was shared repeatedly across Facebook groups set up by parents of children on the autism spectrum.Having grown up in Ballynahinch, she says that her love of the Irish lsquocraicrsquo has also helped her build a powerful rapport with patients by chatting about their families, hobbies, interests and personal lives.She explained: ldquoOne of my best successes was a young bride-to-be whorsquod damaged her teeth in a car accident. She was already nervous about getting in the chair and the fact her big day was coming up made it even worse.ldquoIt was round the time I was planning my own wedding, so I knew exactly how important wedding photos would be.ldquoIt was challenging because she was so nervous. But we overcame that and also got a brilliant result on her teeth with a combination of really nice white fillings, a couple of crowns and a wee bit of Invisalign braces to do a bit of straightening.ldquoNot only did she look absolutely beautul for her wedding, but six months later she was back for her next check-up, hopped into the chair and was totally relaxed. That was so rewarding to see.Jane met her husband, Martin Hier, while undergoing punishing training at a gym in Inverness. The couple both regularly compete in triathlons and Iron Man events.As well as working full-time, Jane is also studying towards a diploma ndash and a later a masterrsquos degree ndash in restorative dentistry. She also finds time to volunteer on the RNLIrsquos Kessock leboat, an Atlantic  class boat.

Now these bad experiences are to surface again. And all in a strange and frightening environment. Our role is to give them the best support we can and deliver a caring and professional service.ldquoSome young witnesses appear to be calm. Others arrive visibly distressed. Some may appear totally indferent. In common though, they all have inner fears. I have heard young witnesses say they just want to get the day, or days, over, put it all behind them, move on.Judith said days at court can be long, intensive and wearing, explaining thatand when the time comes to give evidence, the young witnesses are now faced with their greatest fear mdash that of giving evidence.She explained how when the time came for the young witness to give evidence, it would be just the two of them alone in a room with a video-link.ldquoI must be a strong, quiet presence and remain so even when hearing harrowing evidence, said Judith. ldquoThis highly-charged time in the video-link room can be sharp, splintering and painful.ldquoWhen that ordeal is finally over the young witness can sometimes stay with us waiting to hear a judgement. This may bring relief, or, bring unwelcome news. Emotions can be mixed and unpredictable.Judith said she regretted the ordeals and traumas that the young witness had to face but marvels at their bravery and strength, adding: ldquoIt is truly a privilege to support these young people.Anyone interested in volunteering for the Young Witness Service is asked to contact Billy Eagleson on    or email billy.eagleson@nspcc.org.uk.

However, all three are capable of handling the big occasion and they could well form the basis of the Down defence.In attack, Down should have Glasdrummanrsquos Connaire Harrison fully fit again and his partnership with Burrenrsquos Donal OrsquoHare is central to Tallyrsquos aspirations.This duo have the ability to unlock any defence and the task of supplying them with good ball could fall to McKernan, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin and brothers Jerome and Ryan Johnston, and Clonduffrsquos Barry OrsquoHagan.Kieran McGeeney, now in his fth year in charge at Armagh, was able to get Armagh to hold their own in Division , but the Orchard County, although doing well in the Qualiers, have yet to win a game in Ulster under their former captain.Theof Stefan Campbell and Jamie Clarke this season and Rian OrsquoNeillrsquos arrival gives the Armagh a serious cutting edge and they could just be too sharp for Down to handle.The last time Down played Armagh in the Ulster Championship was only two years ago and the job of nullying Clarkersquos influence on the game was handed to Darren OrsquoHagan mdash a marking job that enabled Down to record a notable win.ldquoGoing into that game Oisin McConville was saying that Armagh had one of the best full-forward lines in the country and yet they were still in Division , the Down captain said.Sundayrsquos game canrsquot come quick enough for the Clonduff man and he expects a tough, hard-hitting encounter and fireworks from start to finish.ldquoItrsquos a local derby. Therersquos definitely no love lost. Itrsquos real. People probably think itrsquos not, but here has to be that hatred there, he remarked.ldquoItrsquos like Clonduff playing Kilcoo. I know all the Kilcoo players, but once theyrsquore wearing a dferent jersey on the field you hate them. You need that mdash you need that bit of hunger. Thatrsquos why you play county football.ldquoI want to win. I love playing county football and I think Paddy Tally will get an Ulster title out of Down. I donrsquot knowit will happen this year, next year or in three years, but I do think he can build a team that could do it, he added.ldquoYou set out every year to win andwe beat Armagh it will be massive for us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down Council director Bob Arnott  ","story":"A FORMER Down Council director who was chairman of the Northern Ireland Kidney Research Fund has passed away.Mr Bob Arnott mdash who was in s mdash was heralded as playing a crucial role in supporting medical research that has helped to change lives around the world.He was also regarded as a beacon of hope for people who spend time on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.Billy Thompson, vice-chairman of the Kidney Research Fund, said Mr Arnott played a very large and invaluable role in the organisation from its very early stages.ldquoHe was so passionate about the importance of organ transplants and he helped to raise awareness of the importance of research and of organ donations, said Mr Thompson.ldquoNorthern Ireland now leads the way in kidney transplants and ranks highly in Europe for having the highest number of living kidney donations.Mr Thompson said Mr Arnott also played a leading part in growing the charity to what it is today.He added: ldquoOver the years we have helped to fund research which has resulted in papers on renal failure being presented at medical conferences around the world.

Well, my motive is that I want to see this land blessed by God and delivered from its enemies I’d like to see Northern Ireland remain part of the United Kingdom I’d like to see Protestantism dominate this country I’d like to see the cause of Islam, homosexuality, secularism, atheism and Irish republicanism confounded.”He referred to “the rise of the sodomite or homosexual agenda” in Northern Ireland and “the collapse in morals just over the border in the Irish Republic”, and went on to say that “the problem with democracy ... [is] the pressure to be popular ... you’ve got to please the mob”.Mr Barker said in the sermon: “I just automatically vote for the Democratic Unionist Party, the DUP – I say it from here: I vote for them every time”, but that he had become increasingly disillusioned with moves by the party.He read from a News Letter report about Belfast Lord Mayor Brian Kingston’s attendance at a Gay Pride event and cited the party’s meeting with gay marriage campaigners as evidence of it abandoning its religious roots.He said that he phoned the party and was put through to the press office where he said he was told that the mayor was “doing his civic duties”.Mr Barker said that during a one-and-a-half hour phone call he quoted the Bible to the press officer and told him: “By mixing with these people and having your picture taken, then surely you’re consenting to what’s going on ”, Ron Graham, and Margaret McGuckin from the SAVIA lobby group\"  , Ron Graham, and Margaret McGuckin from the SAVIA lobby group\"  Abuse victims: Karen Bradley unfit to govern and should resign Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said he was “naming names” because some Free Presbyterians may come to church each week and always vote DUP and “still think it’s a good Christian party that stands for truth, but it’s not it’s gone”.He denounced Arlene Foster’s attendance at a GAA match on a Sunday, a LGBT event in Stormont and Eid celebrations. And he also cited Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s willingness to welcome the pope to Northern Ireland. Mr Barker put it to the congregation: “Anyone here interested in what the pope has to say  Raise your hand now. No. He’s a devil he’s an antichrist.”Mr Barker concluded by saying: “I’ve given up on politics in Northern Ireland. I had great hopes when I came here. I’ve lost all confidence.”The Rev James Porter was minister of the Markethill church at the time. When asked by the News Letter whether the sermon had been removed because it was critical of the DUP, the Rev Porter said: “I am no longer the minister in Markethill so I really would not want to comment.” He said that he thought that it was unlikely that anyone  would want to comment.When asked by the News Letterhe had requested that the sermon to be removed, Mr Barker said: “I don’t know why it was removed from SermonAudio. I found it was removed on Monday and I was saddened by that. I have not had an explanation.” He added: “I don’t regret anything I said in the sermon. All the points were based on the Bible and all the illustrations I researched and confirmed that they were accurate because I wanted to avoid using hearsay or rumour.”* Audio of the full sermon can be listened to hereJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Traffic and Travel   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Traffic and Travel      Horror smash: jeep ploughs into back of carPictures of a horric aftermath of a crash involving a suspect drink driver in Magherafelt last night have been released by the local PSNI.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

years in the business  ","story":"Edward Wilson CBE, Chairman of Ulster Carpets, has retired after over half a century at the leading luxury carpet manufacturer. Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/border_1.jpg","title":"trusted trader status could help ni firms with brexit","story":"Posted on Monday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland exporters could avoid some of the damaging impact and friction of a hard Brexit by adopting the Government’s ‘trusted trader’ status, Ulster Business can reveal.According to Safeguard AEO, a firm which assists businesses in getting the green light for the so-called Authorised Economic Operatortrading quality mark, the global arrangement could help firms avoid heavy friction with trade, following Brexit.The status is a quality marker, which the Government says allows businesses to fast-track shipments through customs, and is something which could be crucialthe UK leaves the EU without a deal.And while such an arrangement has not yet been firmed up by the Government, Richard Thompson of Safeguard AEO believes it’s something which is seriously being considered.According to figures reported by the BBC,  applications for AEO were received between June  and January this year, with fewer than half the applications being approved.“It is dependent on the arrangement that is put in place between Dublin and say Belfast,” Mr Thompson says.“If you are moving stuff from the north to the south, then that accreditation will be recognised in the south, and those goods could just move .”The AEO is a global scheme, which was first introduced by the World Customs Organisation .The firm provides software and support to both small and large firms, taking them through a green, amber and red light system for the ious stages of the complex AEO system, ensuring each area meets the correct standards before the application is submitted.“Businesses should be thinking very seriously about getting this accreditation. Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.
