It was only approved on appeal to the Welsh Government on condition that \u0027robust flood defences\u0027 were put in.Housebuilders Redrow are now footing the bill for the family\u0027s stay in a Cardiff hotel after the entire garden vanished into the storm waters.         The couple\u0027s home bordered  a wide stretch of land on the banks of the River Ebbw         This image shows how the area of land next to the couple\u0027s home has been washed away by raging torrents following the floodingHe said: \u0027My neighbours knocked on my door and said the river has burst its banks. It was like watching a film as it was happening. Over a period of around an hour I watched the river bank collapse and take my garden.\u0027The fence was swept away along with the garden furniture, the patio and all of the recycling bins. Then it proceeded to take scaffolding we had up to fit solar panels.\u0027I rushed my family out. I had to get them out and away from the property. We are all traumatised.\u0027Leigh and wife Simone had to guide daughter Ellie to safety while she was still in her pyjamas.Leigh said: \u0027My wife and daughter just sat in the car because we didn\u0027t know where to go.

We bought the house in good faith. The pair of us are at breaking point. There is so much uncertainty.\u0027Leigh added: \u0027We were assured by the developers that all the flood defences were in place. My house never was fit for purpose.\u0027         Pictured: How the garden looked before the river burst its banks and destroyed it outside the home in South Wales The couple are now waiting to find out if they will be rehoused by Redrow, one of Britain\u0027s biggest housebuilders employing more than 2,000 people.A spokesman for Newport Council said it was working to \u0027protect people and property\u0027 at the riverside site.He said: \u0027In 2005, Newport City Council refused planning permission for a residential development on the former Tredegar Park Golf Course on the grounds of the flood risk and the loss of the natural floodplain.\u0027But that decision was overturned by the Welsh Assembly Government.The spokesman said: \u0027It concluded that the risk of flooding would not be unacceptable and placed considerable weight on the applicant\u0027s claim that new flood defences would provide enhanced further protection further downstream.\u0027Kate Lacey, head of customer services at Redrow South Wales said: \u0027We understand this is a difficult and distressing time for Mr Adams, his family and all those in the local community who\u0027ve been seriously affected by Storms Dennis and Ciara.\u0027We are doing all we can to support him as a valued customer, including acting quickly to arrange temporary hotel accommodation.\u0027Although we appreciate it may be little consolation for Mr Adams, the flood defence works approved by the relevant authorities and put in place near the site, and further up the River Ebbw, helped to significantly mitigate the damage from this extreme weather event.\u0027There are 108 occupied homes on the site and the Adams\u0027 home remains the only uninhabitable property as a result of storm damage.\u0027We will continue to do what we can to help the Adams family during this distressing time.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Helicopter lands university car park student bag forgot it","story":"Share this article          A university spokesman confirmed that a helicopter did land on the NWU\u0027s Vaal campus (pictured) in front of the student centre          As the student walks away, the filmer exclaims: \u0027F****** chopper came to deliver his f****** bag.

When the UAE was formed he became its first Minister of Defence. His interest in aviation saw the launch of Emirates airways in 1985 – now one of the biggest airlines in the world.In 1995 he was made Crown Prince and de facto ruler, succeeding his brother Maktoum to the throne in 2006.By then the economic miracle that is the modern Dubai was well under way. It had taken shape under his own auspices – and tight control. If Dubai was to outlive its reliance on oil and become the business and leisure hub of the Gulf, if not the whole of the Middle East, it would have to be noticed. Sheikh Mohammed achieved this with a number of spectacular projects.There was the sail-shaped hotel Burj Al Arab, off the same Jumeirah beach where he once raced horses, described as the world’s most luxurious.         The portfolio includes horse racing operations in Ireland, the US and Australia, a £385million 500ft superyacht (pictured), a fleet of private jets, including at lest one Boeing 747, and more than 100 supercars In 2010 he opened the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. The sheikh relaxed visa rules for educated Western expats and allowed the consumption of alcohol in the many resorts and hotels. This was no Saudi Arabia.As the majority shareholder of Dubai Holding – the emirate’s investment vehicle – much of the income from these ventures flowed into his own coffers. He and his three brothers are said to each make $1million (£770,000) a day from its oil wealth alone.And a considerable chunk has been invested in his lavish life in the UK. He bought the Longcross estate near Chertsey in Surrey several decades ago. It is now thought to be worth around £75million.He also owns the 63,000-acre, 30-bedroom Inverinate estate in the Scottish Highlands and an £85million townhouse in Kensington, west London. The portfolio includes horse racing operations in Ireland, the US and Australia, a £385million 500ft superyacht, a fleet of private jets, including at lest one Boeing 747, and more than 100 supercars.       Princess Haya is pictured with her husband Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashed al-Maktoum at Ascot Racecourse in 2008 Not all was conspicuous consumption. In 2007 Sheikh Mohammed announced what was then perhaps the biggest philanthropic donation in history. He would give $10billion (£7.7billion) to set up an educational foundation named after himself. On a smaller scale, in 2017 he gave the Cornish village of Godolphin Cross £100,000 to buy a community hall. Yet a shadow had begun to grow over this splendour, generosity and – along the tourist beaches of Dubai – superficial hedonism.A series of human rights scandals have rocked Dubai and the UAE. Homosexuality is still illegal and punished with severity.Free speech is limited and some 250,000 migrant unskilled workers are said to live in conditions which are less than humane. The UAE has also been a major participant in the brutal war in Yemen which has killed thousands of civilians. Campaign group Human Rights Watch says any attempt to paint the UAE government as tolerant is ‘laughable’. Society is patriarchal to the point of oppression.Yesterday’s decision by a London court lifted the veil.For the ‘world’s richest man’, such scrutiny is bad business."},{"url":null,"title":"Fridge makers misleading customers food hold","story":"Share this article Brands such as Miele, Logic and Fridgemaster overstated volumes by the least, but that was still 29 per cent more than claimed.It advises fridge freezer buyers to look for evenly spaced shelves that can be adjusted to suit their shopping habits. ‘No wonder it’s a chore to pack away all your food after a shop.

It helps men to rise above themselves,” wrote Albert Camus in La Peste (The Plague), his 1947 novel about of how a deadly plague devastates a quarantined town.More than 70 years later, the global threat of the coronavirus is sending today’s readers towards novels about epidemics in droves. Publishers around the world are reporting booming sales of books including La Peste, as well as Stephen King’s The Stand and Dean Koontz’s “frighteningly relevant” The Eyes of Darkness, which has become the subject of conspiracy theories online owing to its prescience.One online reviewer wrote: “It coincides with events happening today to a spooky degree and made my blood turn to ice in my veins.” Another said: “How could a writer possibly know about manmade viruses in 1981 that are now killing people in the same way that is described in this book? A great read but totally baffled.”“Although it’s usually considered as an allegory for the French experience of Nazi occupation during the second world war, it couldn’t be more relevant to the current moment,” said Penguin classics’ editorial director, Jess Harrison.The interest in fictionalised takes on epidemics has been mirrored in other forms of entertainment. A 2012 strategy video game, Plague Inc, has reported a huge leap in players, and Warner Bros has reported that its 2011 film Contagion, a Steven Soderbergh movie about a pandemic, had risen from 270th in December 2019 to second on its most watched list.

Committee chair Mel Stride might as well have shrugged and said: “He’ll do, I suppose.”The case for Bailey’s defence is that no boss of the FCA, or its predecessor body, had ever emerged with a pristine record. Even so, a lot happened on his watch – and campaigner Gina Miller reckoned she had a full “damning dossier”.The gating of Neil Woodford’s funds generated the most headlines, but the more obvious regulatory failure was the collapse of mini-bond issuer London Capital \u0026amp Finance, where it will be a miracle, or a stitch-up, if the official inquiry does not find the FCA to have been asleep. Then there was the failure of Lendy, the peer-to-peer loans platform, a new industry and thus one where regulators should police every corner.It would be wrong to say Bailey is returning to the Bank with less than full authority – perceptions change once a governor is in office. But he could do with getting off to a flyer.The easy part for the government was refusing Flybe’s request for a £100m loan.The Connect consortium that owned Flybe – a combo of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Air and US hedge fund Cyrus Capital – had only wooly investment intentions. It was puzzling how the terms of any loan could qualify as “commercial” if no commercial lender was willing to step in. The spread of the coronavirus might quickly have made £100m an inadequate sticking-plaster, as argued here on Thursday. Ministers had little choice.But there is still a big job to be done – minimising the fallout from Flybe’s failure. On that score, the new aviation minister, Kelly Tolhurst, came to the Commons bearing only good intentions. The government “stands ready” to help regional airport and regional connectivity, she said.Come on, the government has had seven weeks to prepare for Flybe’s demise. Many routes will be picked up by other airlines, but not all. By now one would expect ministers to have decided which of the marginal routes will be protected via public service obligation subsidies, as already applied to Flybe’s London-Newquay operation.Details, it seems, will follow in the “regional air connectivity review” that was commissioned in January. The government needs to step up the pace. There is an obvious danger of a domino effect in which regional airports are thrown into financial crisis after the disappearance of their largest customer.The way to address that threat is not by “standing ready” – it’s by making some decisions, sharpish.Sharon White got three things right in her debut as chairman of the John Lewis Partnership.Second, White offered a long-term perspective on John Lewis’ woes. The partnership has two well-regarded brands, it made an overall profit of £123m last year and its debt ratio improved. Things could be worse.The problem, though, is that it’s easy to imagine how the position could deteriorate. Last year was the third year in a row in which profits declined. The business plainly has too much physical space. Some of the department stores look tired and Waitrose loses its Ocado tie-up in September.Thus the third item White called correctly was to hint at radicalism in her strategic review. “Right sizing” is management guff, but, if it’s meant to convey the inevitability of closures and job losses, fair enough: shutting two or three small Waitroses a year is no longer going to cut it.White is also prepared to contemplate the heresy of dropping the “never knowingly undersold” price promise. A few partners and customers may be shocked, but there must be a point at which it makes no commercial sense to match every competitors’ promotion while simultaneously offering superior service.White’s reforms will be judged by results, but a dose of cold realism, which is what she offered on Thursday, was a promising start."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b90185405b464236a43d6a147d746abbb4fe5abc/598_4_2757_1654/master/2757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40bcff00b40f513fb72c1425714b4fe9","title":"how small businesses can defeat the issue of late payments once and for all","story":"With some small tweaks, SMEs can better prepare themselves against the damage inflicted by late paymentsAfter one large online retailer paid Pietrasik late two seasons in a row, she decided to walk away and now prioritises small independent boutiques and her own website. “We’re focusing on staying strong and small,” she adds, “not needing to grow big and unstable.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/703ba7fe4a0492ca5bfa203a35a2a4ff60f180f3/304_0_4372_2624/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1d657b76586f35e974bf1b66a6dc52e","title":"the guardian view on levelling up easy to say hard to do","story":"The collapse of Flybe is a timely pre-budget reminder. Regional equality is costly, complex and long termThe collapse of the regional airline Flybe carries a serious and timely warning for Boris Johnson’s government. Having campaigned in December’s general election on a promise to “level up” the disparate and unequal regional economies of the UK – and having won a spectacular election victory in some of the more deprived English regions – ministers had been keen to show that they meant it. When the Exeter-based airline threatened to collapse in January, the government duly stepped in to attempt a rescue package to keep it in the air. Now, less than two months later, Flybe has gone into administration anyway. The coronavirus outbreak’s impact on airline bookings was the last straw. The effect on regional connectivity in these islands is likely to be grim. Around 2,000 people have lost their jobs, with others likely to follow in the supply chain.The wider lesson of Flybe is that ministers can do the right thing, as they did here, but without achieving the sustained effect that they had hoped for. This lesson matters a lot, because the problem of regional inequality is very extensive and extremely complex. It also matters because the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to set out a more strategic approach to the problem and to make it a centrepiece of next week’s budget. It is important for the regions and the country, never mind the government, that he gets it right. Flybe is a reminder in two ways that this is not easy: first because big sums of money are often involved over a long period in effective government interventions, and second because the economic impact of coronavirus may also be fierce in unforeseen ways.None of this should cast doubt on the importance of the levelling-up project. But it underlines that such a project is costly, complex and long-term. It won’t do for the project to be merely a slogan. But it won’t do either to dismiss it as hopelessly inadequate even before it has begun. The test of it will lie in a variety of things, among them the scale of the financial commitment, the breadth and adaptability of the approaches, the role of local democracy, and the recognition that the benefits (and any disbenefits) may only become clear over a much longer period than one electoral cycle. For that reason, the chair of the Industrial Strategy Council, Andy Haldane, was right to suggest last month that a system of targets will be necessary.In a well-timed pre-budget intervention this week, a report from the centre right thinktank Onward proposes a series of areas and goals on which Mr Sunak could concentrate. The core of the report is its argument that investment to improve prosperity and productivity goes disproportionately to regions that are already more prosperous and productive. This argument has often been made in relation to capital investment in transport, and is also a frequent source of complaint in the cultural sphere. But the report broadens the charge. London, it argues, gets nearly twice the UK average R\u0026ampD spend per head and five times as much support for affordable housing as the rest of England. Only London and Scotland consistently benefit from above-average spending levels in all the areas surveyed in the report.Mr Sunak has an opportunity to start to turn the tide next week. The Onward report lists several options: they include changing the Treasury’s “green book” methodology favouring London and the south-east, ringfencing funding for less wealthy regions like the east Midlands, and more devolution. This last is particularly important. Regions need an effective democratic voice in this reallocation. Mr Sunak could also consider the suggestion that instead of confining the UK’s cutting-edge technology research inside the south-east’s existing “golden triangle”, it could be centred in Glasgow or Newcastle.This is, in every sense, a national debate for Britain. The country is out of joint. The nations and regions need a new growth-enhancement settlement. All the political parties know it. Innovative thinking on the centre-right exists alongside Labour’s big debate about the revival of towns. Britain has a long and at times effective tradition of levelling through economic transfers. It is in need of revival. This could be a big moment for that. Much will depend on how far Mr Sunak rises to the challenge next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187f3bcf162bc48954f838773af28026f7ba3089/0_322_4856_2915/master/4856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58f3fa2dc9c52ee933626b147bbdd1a","title":"travelling through asia during the coronavirus its like i have the whole place to myself","story":"Nowhere is really safe and so you may as well be in Bangkok, on this boat, enjoying life and the delicious, tiny canapésShould I go? Should I go? I really shouldn’t go. What if I get sick – or even worse, get detained on Christmas Island?One editor thinks being quarantined in a detention centre will make a good Diary. But Bonnie, the international news editor – who has been non-stop exposed to stories about coronavirus since January – sits me down for a serious chat.“Brig, I don’t think you should go.” She knows I will go.“If you go, you should … ” and then she proceeds to demonstrate what I should do when I board the plane. It’s insane and looks very similar to Naomi Campbell’s much mocked but eerily prescient pre-flight routine.Bonnie stands up in the tearoom with a pretend bottle of disinfectant in one hand and a pretend cloth in the other.“Wear a mask and gloves on the plane. Wipe down all the surfaces, and I mean all of them. Scrub around the seat including the armrest and the tray table.”She contorts herself and shows me how she would spray and scrub under the tray table and around the seat pocket.“When you land, dispose of the gloves in the bin and then put on a fresh pair.”I board the packed flight to Bangkok and do not disinfect my area or wear a mask. I have not bought gloves. I don’t even have hand sanitiser (sold out at my local pharmacies, no doubt to people who are not leaving the country).As I take my assigned seat, angry words my mother has said to me come back to haunt me: “You cannot clean properly if your life depends on it!” Now, it is literally, actually true.If I get coronavirus it will be because I was too lazy to clean my area.At the world’s largest private open-air museum for a day of cycling. We have our temperature checked on the way in, pick up our bikes and spend a leisurely afternoon enjoying the 28 Days Later vibe at this usually popular attraction that caters for large tour groups from China.The following day we take a boat cruise up an empty waterway and a food tour around empty temples and quiet marketplaces.That night, members of the international media and celebrity guests are meeting at a five-star hotel to celebrate an annual river boat race and the unveiling of the hotel’s new luxury boat. In our rooms is a gift pack which includes a beautifully designed and packaged bottle of hand sanitiser. It is massive, the size of a small bottle of champagne.There is a party on the boat that evening. No one is wearing masks. Sex and the City creator Candace Bushnell is there with some friends from New York. I ask her if she’s worried about travelling, you know with the virus and all but she just shrugs and says, “I mean, it’s in Oregon.”I take this to mean that as the virus is in Oregon, nowhere is really safe and so you may as well be in Bangkok, on this boat, enjoying life and the delicious, tiny canapés.The airport is very, very quiet. Everyone working here wears masks and around half the passengers are masked. But what I notice most is the absence of something. Just like Bangkok didn’t feel like Bangkok, the airport doesn’t feel like an airport. Big, busy international airports have a distinctive stressful energy about them, but here on a Sunday morning, there is a new, unsettling atmosphere. It has a deserted 3am vibe.I haven’t worn my mask for the whole trip. It’s not the right sort anyway, a leftover from January when there was bad pollution and bushfire haze in Melbourne (and this makes me sad to think about – that we now have these disparate problems that require us to wear different masks).But I’m thinking about wearing my mask because when I’m at the gate, a British woman opposite me starts coughing violently and doesn’t cover her mouth.The cough appears to be coming from deep in her lower lungs. It is vaguely “wet” in sound, has a top note of rasp and is dredging what I imagine to be yellow phlegm.The protocol is to cough into your elbow. I narrow my eyes at her and give her an evil look. I take out my mask slowly and put it on. She takes a pause then coughs again into the air between us.I move seats and wonder if I’ve caught the coronavirus from her.The airport here is almost deserted. The hotel is quiet. On Monday there are four of us in a large, empty hall purchasing tickets to see the country’s greatest attraction: Angkor Wat.“Usually there are hundreds of people lining up about now,” says our guide. We go to the temple precinct. We have it to ourselves. There’s a dribble of tourists around 8.30am. The car park has a few smaller vans and some cars but there are no tour buses. None. None! At one of the world’s most famous attractions!!! We walk the wrong way down empty passages and pose for photos in an empty courtyard.All morning I take photographs of Angkor Wat with no-one in the background. I imagine this is what it was like travelling in the 1950s – pre Maureen and Tony Wheeler. This is surely good, in an era of mass tourism to have this amazing place to ourselves – yet, yet … it doesn’t feel right.It’s getting towards 11am and the heat is brutal. We stop at a stall for a coconut. Our guide tells us that the coconut seller is really struggling without tourists. “It’s going to be a very quiet, very hard year for them,” he says.On the way back into Siem Reap we go past hotel after hotel that is shuttered up, curtains drawn, with the carparks empty. Post coronavirus, one has already gone into administration.The gem shops are shut, as are the tourist gift stores catering for tour buses.This is the other cost of the virus. It’s not just the empty hotel beds and restaurants and shops, but the thousands of Cambodian and Thai hotel room cleaners, laundry workers, hospitality staff, rickshaw drivers and coconut sellers. All the people and their families downstream in the tourist industry are really going to suffer. They’re suffering already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9d02e0657fc5371436b8f63c203cb7334778ca/0_3_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=656d7c998fa04fa2dc9cb4857bec5a3e","title":"european critics on uk culture this is europe","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge talked sex. Ken Loach exposed class. Amy Winehouse hit listeners in the heart. After Brexit, does British culture still inspire the same affection abroad? Europe’s leading critics give their thoughtsBack in the late 90s, when I lived in London, the UK was in the EU, Tony Blair had led Labour to a landslide win, rave music was roaring out of clubs, in-yer-face theatre was all the rage, the National Theatre had a bias for the classics and standing ovations were a rarity.Much has changed two decades on. When I saw five shows in London last week, I realised there had been some major unheralded shifts in the key themes of contemporary English playwriting, which now mainly focus on British identity post-Brexit.Death of England, by Clint Dyer and Roy Williams, is a relentlessly pungent new play about mourning and identity, seen from an inidual and a national perspective. “Let’s face some facts: we are shit, we are shit at everything! Because England now is nothing but an island of shit,” declares Michael, the play’s sole character.It’s in-yer-face theatre meets Pinter in an exploration of angry nationalism and inner turbulence thanks to Rafe Spall’s demonic, blusterous delivery. It was bold of Rufus Norris to produce such an explosively provocative play at the National, but this seems to be exactly the kind of theatre audiences crave now: political plays that speak out the truth for people who feel they have been abandoned by their leaders plays that put up a mirror for the audiences to look into and engage in some courageous self-reflection.Death of England reminds me of an astonishing new Greek play called Sleep, Stella, Sleep, directed and written by cinematographer Yannis Economides. It poignantly delineates the deformities and malfunctions of Greek society that led to the crisis ravaging the country for more than a decade. Focusing on the dismantled bonds among family members and the dominance of a beastly patriarchal figure, Economides’s play, like Death of England, sheds light on the ailing cell of the family, which contaminates its iniduals and, in turn, society.From the Garden of Eden to Chekhov’s Cherry Orchard, gardens allude to life, nations or the state of being. In Mike Bartlett’s play Albion, the garden is a clear metaphor for England itself. Audrey (a dazzling Victoria Hamilton) is keen on regenerating a neglected green space in rural England. “This is a major project of national importance,” Audrey admits, only to realise a few months later that “there are some things that can’t be restored”. It’s the gardener of the estate, the withering Matthew – impeccably portrayed by Geoffrey Freshwater – who insists on delivering the final line of the play: “A rose. We have to keep it.” Is it a metaphor for England, cut off from the garden of the European Union and destined to dry up and perish? The Greek equivalent to Albion is a new robust work called Agrios Sporos (Wild Seed) by Giannis Tsiros. The wild seed of the title is a palpable metaphor for the pre- and post-crisis Greek who can develop roots in every single “soil” and survive against all odds. As in Athens, the name of the game in London theatres in 2020 is ersity. In London you can opt for a West End musical such as the feelgood show Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, or Temi Wilkey’s jolly family drama The High Table, in which two British Nigerian women decide to get married and invoke their ancestral spirits to bless their union. If somebody wishes to encounter an all-British theatre experience, Witness for the Prosecution by Agatha Christie is the show to choose. Where once it was politicians who faced each other across the imposing chamber of London’s County Hall, now it is QCs Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Myers who battle against each other to prove the innocence or guilt of Leonard Vole.In Athens, you can choose among several courtroom dramas, including the immaculately structured 12 Angry Men at the Alkmini and the interactive Terror at Athinon – where the audience functions as the jury. If you look for the equivalent of Jamie Lloyd’s auspiciously deconstructed Cyrano de Bergerac in Athens, head for the Swedish classic The Father at the Apothiki, awesomely reimagined by director Vassilis Bisbikis.In Athens there are 1,500 shows to choose from, with tickets priced from €10 to €25, whereas in London tickets range from £20 to £200. More and more shows in Athenian venues are played with English subtitles but unlike the British habit of eating and drinking during the show, food and drinks are not allowed in Greek theatre venues while the show is on. What’s the difference between a British comedy critic and a French one? The latter was out of professional luck long before the decline of newspapers. Writing about comedy isn’t really a job description in France, where the popularity of standup is very much a 21st-century thing. Before the mid-2000s, French comedians mostly favoured character-driven vignettes, led by prominent impersonators as well as such troupes as 1980s favourites Les Inconnus and Les Nuls.Even the recent boom of English-style standup in France hasn’t led to renewed critical examination of the genre, which tends to be seen in highbrow circles as just a bit of fun. So when the , in an effort to promote the free movement of banter, looked for a French critic to weigh in on British standup specials, they settled on me – a theatre writer whose main claim to comedy expertise is many a Christmas spent watching the beloved 1979 play-turned-film Santa Claus Is a Stinker, a French classic that involves a character being chopped to pieces in the bathroom of a depression helpline’s offices.While I’m told the British comedy scene is in rude health, not much of it has reached France since Monty Python and Mr Bean. I’ll admit the only active British comedian that came to mind was John Oliver, and he has been based in the US since the mid-00s. In my defence, there are practical hurdles for French viewers hoping to hone some British-style quips. Netflix France only offers a small number of the specials available to watch in the UK many specials turned out to have been produced by the BBC, whose programmes are notoriously hard to access from abroad.As a result, while American comedians such as Amy Schumer and Ali Wong are now fixtures on Netflix’s list of suggestions for French subscribers, few viewers are likely to come across Bridget Christie or Gina Yashere. It’s a shame, because a week’s exposure to them and some of their peers left me wanting more. There is a craft to British comedy that speaks to its longer history, and to the competition standups presumably face to make their mark on a crowded scene. Most routines were impressively paced, building on the natural rhythm of British speech French intonation, which is much more even, doesn’t quite allow for the same musical variations.If you’d asked me beforehand to come up with a police sketch of a British comedian, it would have looked a lot like James Acaster, whose Netflix-produced Repertoire is available in France. He is lanky and self-deprecating, and the storylines holding these four shows together would be too surreal for most French comedians.Starting a performance on his knees? Pretending to be an undercover cop posing as a comic? Spinning an entire hour out of jury duty on a murder case? It’s masterful storytelling in addition to absurd fun, and clever enough to satisfy the most intellectual audience. Even his quip that he loves French cuisine and “that’s why this story takes place in a Pret a Manger” works in France now, since Pret has taken over the Paris high street.The level of deprecation I saw is fascinating from a French perspective because, as a country, we’re just not very good at taking the piss out of ourselves. Many local comedians are masters of the humblebrag, as a way to come out of a vulnerable moment and still look cool. They wouldn’t be caught dead as Sarah Millican’s adventurous sex-averse persona in Thoroughly Modern Millican, yet her warm, mischievous relationship with her audiences is a joy to follow. Her Geordie accent has a sing-song unpretentiousness that is also easier to latch on to as a foreigner than, say, John Bishop’s Scouse, which left me puzzling over some jokes.While French humour tends to be more risque (if you don’t know what that means, just watch Blanche Gardin on Netflix), there is much to love in the unabashed progressiveness of a number of British standups. Christie pulls no punches in Stand Up for Her, and her feminist observations hit home, from her take on Adam and Eve to a skit about an audition for a yoghurt advert that involved a man waiting for a woman inside her fridge. Yashere’s bluntness – whether she is describing her snoring or asserting that “we all see colour, otherwise we’d all be walking around dressed like clowns” – is a core part of her appeal. They understand that taking a clear stand doesn’t have to spoil the fun – a notion that France is still grappling with.The cities we Berlin teens wanted to live in were always British: London, Manchester, Bristol – those were the places our favourite bands came from. At the end of the 90s – before the no-frills airlines started – I finally made it to London thanks to a school exchange program. We rode around in the signature red buses looking for record stores and indie clubs, although we had barely any money and everything was incredibly expensive. As teenagers, we took every flyer and free magazine we could get our hands on and brought it home to decorate our bedroom walls, because we loved British music.Almost all Germans did. It all started with the Beatles – the Hamburgers fell in love with them and the whole Bundesrepublik followed. Even in East Germany, where I grew up, two Beatles albums were released, and it felt as if every GDR citizen had them in their tiny record collection. Today, every music magazine and all the so-called experts still rate them as the best band ever.From the Beatles onward, Britain heavily influenced musical development in Germany. Punk in the late 70s, postpunk and new wave in the 80s, trip-hop in the 90s: it all washed in from the UK. Finally, there was Britpop. Round here there was no such thing as fan fights over Blur v Oasis – if you were in to Oasis you also liked Blur, because it was the same genre. In hindsight, it seems like almost every British band in the 90s was cool, just because they were British: Pulp, the Verve, Manic Street Preachers, Supergrass, Suede.These days are hard times for old Britpop fans. Some journalists (including from the ) blame Britpop for Brexit, arguing that it flew the national flag for nostalgia. Without question, some of our British musical heroes have fallen, the most famous being Morrissey. We all loved him. Farin Urlaub, singer with punk band Die Ärzte, even dedicated a famous song – Sumisu – to him that translated as: “Whenever we were sad – and we were sad pretty often – we went home and listened to the Smiths.”The song describes the relationship between teenagers in the 80s and Morrissey. We were sure he was left-wing, just like us – so he alarmed fans with what he said in an interview with Der Spiegel two years ago: “If you try to make everything multicultural, you will not have any culture in the end,” and “I feel sad that Germany has become the rape capital of Europe … it coincides with the open borders and the free flow.” We were like: WTF? Aren’t open borders and multicultural movements a gain for every music scene, and for culture above all?Disappointed and in disagreement, we needed other bands to listen to. Although we aren’t sad any more, we’re often angry, and who can we turn to? The UK. British rap is much more political than most German hip-hop, which is also angry, but often in a sexist or racist way. By contrast, Nothing Great About Britain by Slowthai is an album that deals with Brexit and nationalism with intelligence, humour and aggression. And there is Dave, who just called Boris Johnson a racist at the Brit awards. Or Kate Tempest who sings: “Europe is lost, America lost, London lost  Still we are clamouring victory”. There are exciting punk bands such as Idles, or bands that defy genre, such as the great Sleaford Mods. They are all admired.Even though there are still British superstars such as Adele, Ed Sheeran or Amy Winehouse (always in our hearts!), there is no such thing as “British music” any more. These days it doesn’t matter where musicians come from. You love them because of their image, their quirks, their personality and of course their music, but none of this is bound to a national style or character. That is no Brexit-related phenomenon – it is a global development. Thanks to the internet you have access to billions of songs and artists. Music is on your phone, your laptop, everywhere you want. And it could be from any country.So London isn’t the place of our dreams any more. It’s too expensive, too boring, too fancy, too sleek. Today, in cities around the world – even in gentrified Berlin – we find clubs that are more exciting and gigs that are more mind-blowing. Maybe because by now, many international and multicultural artists have moved there – among them the British.I’m a child of communist-era Poland. Born in 1982, I recall the acute scarcity of 1980s –– and the periodic shocks of visits to the affluent west. I was born to a teacher mum and a doctor dad: the first in their families to have had a university education. My great-grandparents were dirt-poor farmers in the countryside with no electricity. I teach film studies at the University of Warsaw and that’s largely due to the huge social advancement made possible by the communist welfare state –– one that I hate for having destroyed civic virtue in Poland, and yet one that I need to credit for making me who I am. Nobody said being Polish was simple.After communism fell in 1989, class became a dirty word. Poverty in Polish film, if portrayed at all, had an almost metaphysical heft to it: no film-maker dared to explore its causes in government policies. One was either “successful”, or thrown on to the trash heap of doomed deprivation.Had it been not for the British cinema of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, Polish audiences in the 1990s would have forgotten what class meant. We were drawn to films such as Riff-Raff, Raining Stones and Secrets and Lies. With their focus on working-class characters full of vitality, these films offered a freshness missing from our cinema. Years later, I understood where that affinity and respect for the everyday life of the disenfranchised stemmed from. A moment in Lindsay Anderson’s brilliant Every Day Except Christmas never fails to move me: the film-makers thank their subjects (porters at Covent Garden market) for being who they are and doing what they do.In Poland, the class alienation of the late 1990s was near-total: the urban intelligentsia aspired instead to Woody Allen’s New York City, where each night seemed to bring a new gallery opening , intellectual flights of fancy and erotic possibilities. The catastrophic process of shutting down vocational schools was triggered at the same time –– why produce workers when we can have intellectuals and business-people instead? At the same time, a similar betrayal of the working-class in the UK was being fiercely analysed in the work of Loach, Leigh, and others. We loved their films but we failed to recognise that we were following the same perilous path those works decried.Around 2004, many of my friends started emigrating to the UK. Just as many of us were finishing universities, Poles of my generation came to the realisation that even a menial job in the UK paid better and brought firmer prospects than a university degree could warrant in Poland. Our class consciousness grew sharply and rapidly.Now the EU door is being slammed shut. Just as the UK shows its less-welcoming face, Poland is undergoing a deep crisis of national unity, as populist politicians are tearing the social fabric apart by pitting citizens against each other (most recently by scapegoating the LGBTQ+ community). One ritual that didn’t change is that last year I went to see another movie by Ken Loach: Sorry We Missed You, about a package carrier with a precarious existence inside the nightmare of late capitalism. The voice of the 83-year-old British director felt as fresh as ever –– only this time, there was no mistaking that he was speaking of Polish experience, too. Ruefully, we had caught up to Loach’s vision.For me, British cinema remains exemplary in bringing class awareness to the fore while maintaining the highest artistic standards. The social sensitivity of films such as Joanna Hogg’s privilege-examining The Souvenir, Francis Lee’s God’s Own Country and Andrew Haigh’s Weekend is something I hope to see in Polish films one day. Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, as beautiful as it is, historicises class struggle by placing its cross-class romance firmly in a black and white, 1:1.33-ratio.And yet our social reality is so deeply complex right now, it seems ripe for artistic exploration. Class tensions between Polish millennials and boomers are exploding. The urban and the rural areas are at sharp ideological odds. And then, there are the immigrant communities: most notably the Ukrainians, but also others. A gay British couple I know recently moved to a postindustrial city in Poland and are eagerly exploring the Polish artistic scene, even as one of them commutes daily to Warsaw to work for an international corporation. How I would long to see a film on people like them: carving out a space for themselves in a post-Brexit world and enriching Polish society by their presence.When it comes to my relationship with British culture, this whole article could simply be a list of the iconic bands and singers the UK gave us. Or it could be a list of film directors, artists, writers or historical sites. My mum’s favourite band was the Beatles, my dad’s the Rolling Stones. These days, we play grime at parties.With more than 200,000 Lithuanians settled in the UK, British culture is intertwined with almost every family in Lithuania. So for those of us reading the news on our smartphones on the morning of 24 June 2016, during the Midsummer weekend – the most celebrated festival after Christmas in the Baltics – it was one of the most bizarre, surreal, hard-to-believe experience we’ve ever had. Dark uncertainty crept in about the Britain we thought we knew, and stayed there, growing.I briefly lived in London, and often visit the UK to install shows by Pakui Hardware, the artistic duo that I run with Ugnius Gelguda. To me, experiencing British culture was like being inside Zadie Smith’s White Teeth: dense, transgressive, ironic, full of friction and with intriguing chance encounters.Despite struggling to cover their ever-increasing rents and public transport tickets, contemporary artists, curators and writers have clung to London for its dynamism, its compulsive attraction and also its indifference to who you are.The city’s anonymity – animosity almost – brought people together in order to survive. There, acquaintances grew into friendships, friendships grew into communities, communities into art spaces, organisations, and advocacy groups. These smaller community-driven organisations actively pointed to, criticised and took action on faulty points of the status quo of the art world, forcing even large-scale institutions to change their funding and mediation policies in London and other British cities.Here we stumble on the most obvious and prevalent problem today not only in the UK, but the world in general: the urban-rural ide. The British culture I’ve been discussing proliferates in cities – which serve as havens for outsiders, “deviants” from the norm. Rural areas cultivate a more homogenous, white version of British culture. No wonder nationalism and protectionism have been exponentially growing over the past couple of decades, and with the help of populist politicians, are thriving today.It is precisely this conservative, enclosed and frankly dangerous “culture” that has proliferated and been elevated in Britain after Brexit. Immediately after the Brexit deal was signed, the first signs of open and normalised hostility towards anyone and anything that does not comply with this new identity politics spilled out immediately, for instance on the BBC’s Question Time. Not to mention the recently passed policy on performers’ visas, making it increasingly difficult to maintain a dynamic and vital cultural exchange between the UK and the rest of the world. It is immensely sad, not only for us foreigners, but to also see British artists devastated by those surreal and dark shifts in their country.This summer, in July, Ugnius Gelguda and I will have our first institutional solo show in the UK at Baltic centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. “Finally something Baltic in Baltic,” commented some after we announced this news. It’s not going to be the first Baltic-Baltic exchange, however – a few of our artists have already been presented there. It only shows how vibrant the cultural exchange between Britain and other countries has been. This vital flow of cultures, of people, of ideas is what constitutes British culture. At least in my view. Please don’t build a dam to stop it. Build dikes to protect the island from rising sea levels.Naturally it was Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was the last piece of the puzzle, confirming that it’s fine to talk dirty and be something of a monster, as long as you do it with a British accent. Like so many others around the world, I am obsessed with Fleabag – season two was last year’s best TV after Chernobyl. That Waller-Bridge’s series isn’t more successful in Sweden is partly the fault of Amazon for not investing enough time and money here, and partly the fault of the majority of Swedish TV viewers: they’re just not ready for a new wave of challenging, genre-bending British television.Of course, that last sentence is prejudicial, but still, the facts remain: here in the north, new episodes of Midsomer Murders attract far more viewers than a new season of Line of Duty. It’s weird, I know.There have been some successes over the years, obviously. Downton Abbey was a big hit in Sweden – I’ve never had so many angry emails as when I wrote about Matthew Crawley’s necessary death. The success of The Crown also showed that the Swedish crowd are still hungry for British costume dramas.For a long time it was through SVT, the Swedish equivalent of the BBC, that the best British shows got a window here. Nowadays it’s easier, with Netflix, HBO Nordic, Amazon and others., which have allowed us to discover and enjoy Bodyguard, Sex Education, the wonderful Derry Girls and the fantastic first season of The End of the F*** ing World.But still, I envy you. When The Bridge was broadcast, the show’s creator Hans Rosenfeldt and I often talked about how difficult it is to write dialogue for interrogation scenes. You have the master of that in Jed Mercurio. You also have two of the very best in Waller-Bridge and Sally Wainwright, and you take better care of and value scriptwriters more than in Sweden.Still, and I write this with respect: I loathe Britannia and get tired just thinking about The Stranger on Netflix. Also, what painful disappointments Catherine the Great, Dracula and A Christmas Carol were.Around the world, more and more shows are produced and the ones that dare to push boundaries and test new, surprising ways to win viewers’ hearts are fewer and fewer – even if there is more TV than ever before.In this regard, and with a few exceptions, it is surprising that British television isn’t at the forefront globally. Sure, not everything can be as smart as Killing Eve, as brave as Top Boy or as humanly funny and tragic as Catastrophe. But when British TV is great it is really great: as a TV critic, I would love to see a new show that I can’t stop thinking about and, like Fleabag, want to analyse to pieces.I want something that melts my heart and brings tears to my eyes of either laughter or sorrow. And well, it’s bound to happen, since Brits can say almost anything and still make it sound polite and charming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fc561c67fc05e9e55cbac3db2feb2bd87f3412d/0_252_2343_1405/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe34474107cefb60287cb1c31ccc8b24","title":"florence nightingales lamp features in 200th anniversary show","story":"Two hundred years after her birth, exhibition sheds light on nursing pioneerA family album featuring unseen drawings of Florence Nightingale is to go on public display for the first time at a show hoping to shine new light on a figure whose name is world famous.Nightingale, the lady with the lamp, the founding figure of modern nursing, was someone who “is known but not known”, said David Green, director of London’s Florence Nightingale Museum.“Most people in the world have heard of Florence Nightingale, but they don’t really know her full story,” he said.The 200th anniversary of her birth has prompted the museum to shine light on different aspects of her life in an exhibition of 200 objects.They include a family album which was started by Nightingale’s aunt, Ann Elizabeth Nicholson, and passed down through family generations before becoming buried in papers.It was unearthed last year and loaned to the museum. It includes drawings and watercolour sketches, including a small number of Nightingale.Also on display for the first time is a gold watch, given to Nightingale by her father, which she wore throughout her service in the Crimean war. She gave it away because she was largely bed-ridden in later years. “I do not use a watch now, for I am not movable,” she said.That shines light on the less well-known side of Nightingale’s life: her physical and mental health struggles. She contracted what is now understood to be brucellosis, which causes fatigue and muscle pain. It turned her into a recluse in her Mayfair home. “That is bound to have had an effect on her mental health,” said Green.“There is also a very real chance she had post-traumatic stress disorder. She was working in filthy, rat-infested conditions, sanitation was appalling and there were soldiers on the ground, often needing amputations.“Possibly more challenging was dealing with the fame which went with her success,” said Green. Because of Crimea she became a hero, the second most famous person in the British empire, and she hated it. “She did not want the adulation and she struggled with it.”The exhibition will reveal misunderstandings and inaccuracies, such as the lamp carried by Nightingale in the depiction of her on the old £10 note, which was in circulation until 1994. It shows her with a genie-style lamp which had a candle in it rather than the folded Turkish lantern, or “fanoos”, she carried.The actual lamp will be on display, as will a new Florence Barbie doll that carries the correct lamp.Other exhibits include the door knocker from her house in Mayfair, visited by luminaries of the Victorian era, including Prime Minister William Gladstone and Charles Dickens.Green said: “If they were lucky she would see them because there were plenty of times she sent people away, either because she wasn’t in the mood or she wanted to get on with her work.“She was important enough she could do that. People would still come back. When she spoke, people listened.”One of the most curious objects is Nightingale’s pet owl Athena, which she acquired on a visit to the Acropolis in Greece. Seeing that the owl was being tormented by a group of boys, she scooped it up and took it with her on her travels.It became her constant companion and would sit on her shoulder, but it soon died. Nightingale had it stuffed and it was later displayed in the home of her sister Parthenope who wrote a book The Life and Death of Athena an Owlet from the Parthenon.• Nightingale in 200 Objects, People \u0026amp Places: Leader, Icon and Pioneer, is at the Florence Nightingale Museum in the grounds of St Thomas’ hospital, London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557bc0f4263e6da3588aa267b14f914cfe9214de/0_0_3199_2400/master/3199.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4099335707867e4eb64c792b10b2e46 700w","title":"calm with horses review barry keoghan cosmo jarvis ireland","story":"Barry Keoghan and Cosmo Jarvis shine in an unflinching underworld tale with flashes of real poignancy The musician and actor Cosmo Jarvis looks eerily like a young Marlon Brando in this brutal gothic-realist drama set in the west of Ireland, directed by feature first-timer Nick Rowland. Adapted by screenwriter Joe Murtagh from a short story by Colin Barrett in his prize-winning collection Young Skins, it’s a lowlife crime drama with a streak of tragedy, despair and irrelevant black humour. It’s powerfully and pugnaciously acted, and horses are brought in – as animals often are in social-realist movies – as symbols of redemptive nobility. But I felt that in narrative terms it turned into a cul-de-sac of macho violence.Jarvis plays Douglas, a big and ferocious ex-boxer now employed as an enforcer by a firm of drug dealers. This is the Devers family: Paudi (Ned Dennehy) and his notionally more respectable brother Hector (David Wilmot). A young cousin of the Devers is Dympna (Barry Keoghan) who has brought Douglas into this line of work and it is his semi-official job to mind Douglas, to handle him and to make sure he shows up for whatever grisly task the brothers have set. Right now, Douglas has to beat up an old man who has raped Hector’s teenage niece Charlotte (Hazel Doupe), and he dispenses this punishment with considerable professionalism in an all-but-unwatchable scene. But his bosses aren’t satisfied with the level of pain meted out.Meanwhile, Douglas is experiencing a kind of self-awakening. He has a five-year-old son, Jack (Kiljan Moroney), by former partner Ursula (Niamh Algar) the boy has autism, and Ursula has to pester Douglas for the money to send their son to a special school. As his boy gets older, it dimly dawns on Douglas that he, too, has a condition himself: an inability to control his surges of rage and anxiety. Ursula knows that Jack is helped by sessions of horse-riding and suspects the same might be true for Douglas – which results in a tender and engaging scene. Douglas in his muddled way is trying to be a good dad, though is unsure how this could be achieved.But really, the language of this movie is fear and violence, peppered with some black-comic dialogue riffs between Dympna and Douglas. Perhaps the ending of the film is a little predicable, but a talented and well-directed cast keep this movie motoring along, and Jarvis is a fierce screen presence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9d6aac7ec39b18bdddce01cdbd2331bfa71703/0_108_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbc5692a51d5ca5bbb2a0c4f4e2c8048","title":"how romcoms inspired finnish bdsm film dogs dont wear pants","story":"Finnish director Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää ensured that his new film was torture for his actors – literally. But he insists his immersive methods are just like gardeningBDSM is – perhaps surprisingly – big news in Palm Springs, southern California. The director Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää, showing his new, fetish-themed, third feature, Dogs Don’t Wear Pants, at a festival in the city, was confronted with a crowd of incredulous pensioners. “There was a question: is this BDSM thing real? Is it invented?” he says, chuckling. One shocked septuagenarian collared him after the screening to inquire after the mental health of the film’s hero: a widower who, after losing his wife in a drowning accident, tumbles headlong into the S\u0026ampM scene. “She was saying: ‘No, he’s gone crazy. He’s totally lost it,’” says Valkeapää, hooting with laughter. He simmers down. “It’s not a very noble thing to achieve, disturbing old ladies.”Dogs Don’t Wear Pants is indeed disconcerting, but in the best possible way. Rather than being a 50 Shades-style glossy brochure-tour of BDSM, it uses the scene to get intimate with the film’s lead couple – and explore the meaning, and the price, of true emotional honesty. The grieving Juha (Pekka Strang) is on autopilot until he takes his teenage daughter to a tattoo parlour and stumbles into the dungeon next door. There he meets Mona (Krista Kosonen), whose asphyxiation sessions give him a gateway to the final moments with his wife. Morbid on paper, Valkeapää’s kooky, tender film holds you under, then leaves you gasping with renewed lust for life.Valkeapää had no experience of the BDSM scene, nor had the writer whose script he inherited. So he asked his script consultant, a dominatrix called Wild Ira, if he and his actors could attend her sessions. Wild Ira was more than happy to oblige. So the team found themselves opposite a shackled punter being given the works. “She made the session from our point of view,” says Valkeapää, his euphonious Finnish vowels tickling the phone line. “She brought the client closer and closer to us during the whole session. I was just trying to concentrate on keeping myself on the chair.”Being in the room affected him deeply, he says – beyond the intellectual realisation that BDSM, with its “dramaturgy”, had strong affinities with storytelling. “These power dynamics had a very primitive quality, like those between a newborn and an adult who is the caretaker,” he says. “The newborn is the weak one, but still: the newborn is controlling the strong one. And also dependent on them. Nobody can avoid these emotions, or at least I couldn’t.”The team participated in three sessions in the second, the customer had some kind of a seizure that abruptly halted things. “To see the client and the dominatrix, from being into this roleplay of teasing and being teased, suddenly become normal, like everyday people in an accident … that clash was really interesting,” says Strang. “It’s a pretend world, but it’s pretended in the same way as what I do for a living.”Strang had some fetish previous, after his lead role in 2017’s Tom of Finland biopic, but he also had doubts about the film. “There’s always a risk with these rough sexuality scenes that it might come off a bit pretended, or pretentious, like a 90s hardcore movie,” he says. Kosonen, one of Finland’s most famous female actors, needed convincing this was not just a sexy Miss Whiplash-style part also, at that time, she was in the running for a role in Terminator: Dark Fate. But Valkeapää’s sensitivity to the emotions in the air, rather than the kinky paraphernalia, won them over.It was in at the deep end for Strang and Kosonen’s first day at work: him stripped naked her shrinkwrapped toe-to-neck in rubber, whipping and choking him. “I said: ‘Please be rough enough that I don’t have to act,’” says Strang they also employed each other’s real names as makeshift safewords. As much as simulating the physical BDSM experience, Strang insists he wanted to stay mentally “undressed”, too: “In sex scenes, actors tend to laugh it off and jump around naked. But I went the other way. Used the awkwardness and the anxiety that I was feeling and made it bigger.”Valkeapää says that thinking about the film in relation to the traditional romcom helped open it up: “This kind of obsession and attitude of: ‘You don’t love me, but you will.’ If you look at Sleepless in Seattle, Love Actually, most romcoms, they are filled with stalkers.”Valkeapää was also inspired in his subversion tactics by Manchester By the Sea, specifically by its use of Tomaso Albinoni’s well-worn Adagio for a tragic flashback. “I couldn’t believe they used this music. It’s as if you opened the sadness folder, and that’s the first thing you found. For a film that was so skilfully made, it showed such mediocre taste.” So he used the piece to overlay a sex scene, in which Juha’s one-night stand insists on putting it on to get her in the mood, but then can’t stop laughing.The BDSM community – used to being patronised on film – has responded with “overwhelming positivity” on forums, Valkeapää says. The Palm Springs community, at least the seniors, with bewilderment. And what of him? Isn’t there a dom in every director? Aren’t they the kind of control freaks who mete out harsh sanction for every errant detail, such as misusing sad music in arthouse movies? Valkeapää thinks for a second. “I don’t think that analogy is the right one. When you’re making a film, it’s very hard to control everything it’s not something I have illusions about. I think film-making is closer to being a gardener than a dominatrix. You’re subject to the forces of nature all the time, and you try to keep the flowers alive.”Dogs Don’t Wear Pants is out on 20 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c58025f9c16c41eda4d859934fa663c6638edbf4/0_154_4694_2817/master/4694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e92475fd60166cd8c755bf4121ec08","title":"taika waititi to make two charlie and the chocolate factory series for netflix","story":"New Zealand Oscar winner to develop animated show based on the beloved Roald Dahl bookThe Academy Award-winning director Taika Waititi has signed a deal with Netflix to write, direct and produce two animated series based on the works of the children’s author, Roald Dahl.The entertainment giant said Waititi’s collaboration with Netflix would be “based on the world and characters of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”, while the second series would be a “wholly original take” on the Oompa-Loompas, the diminutive and mysterious workers who dispense chocolate, and sometimes cautionary advice, at Willy Wonka’s factory.Waititi won an Academy Award in February for his adapted screenplay, Jojo Rabbit, which he directed, wrote, produced, and starred in. The film centres on a Hitler-obsessed 10-year-old German boy in the 1930s, who discovers a Jewish girl is hiding in his house. Described as “Nazi-satire” it was based on Caged Skies, a 2008 novel by Christine Leunens.Netflix said the animation series of Dahl’s works would “retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time”.A Netflix statement said the collaboration would mark the beginning of an “extensive partnership” with the Roald Dahl Story Company, which will reimagine many of the beloved stories of Roald Dahl, including Matilda, The BFG, and The Twits.“There is something undeniably Wonka-esque about Taika’s creative flair and inimitable sense of humour and we cannot think of anyone more perfectly suited to leading the creative charge on these first of their kind, feature quality Netflix shows,” said Gideon Simeloff, commercial and entertainment Director, Roald Dahl Story Company.Waiti’s other notable works include 2016’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople, a comedy about a foster child who goes on the run from social services with his carer, and Thor Ragnarok from the Marvel series, starring Chris Hemsworth, Cate Blanchett and Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.His Netflix series will follow in the footsteps of Gene Wilder’s 1971 portrayal of Willy Wonka and Johnny Depp’s 2005 interpretation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b9585da9749ebc844e17a8ad0f9199096f977c/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bed69702b779f879434d5f160137a67","title":"bottomless brunch unlimited prosecco sounds like a good idea until youre on your fifth glass","story":"I was eavesdropping, on a bus. What struck me was less the content than that the couple didn’t look like the kind of young people this kind of thing would happen to. They looked like they played touch rugby and drank alcohol-free gin. But anyway …At a bottomless brunch, the girl’s friend had been ejected after 45 minutes. She wasn’t even that drunk – the bouncer had just decided she was. “What was she doing that made them think that?” is the question the guy should have asked, but clearly he wasn’t a trained journalist. While the bouncer was outside arguing with the friend, a third bruncher, a man, stood up – he, again, wasn’t that drunk, apparently – and just happened to fall clean over, like a tree that had been chainsawed. Then they all got kicked out, and wasn’t that quite unfair, given that they had each paid £30 to drink as much prosecco as they humanly could?I nodded in silent, eavesdroppers’ agreement: it was unfair. But then, I think the whole fandango of the bottomless brunch is pretty rum.Prosecco is not the only bottomless option – cocktails are another favourite – but it’s the clear frontrunner. My Mr is a fierce prosecco-phobe, so I have only done it once or twice. It’s so-so value, I suppose. You have to be drinking pretty fast to make it worthwhile, considering a regular bottle in a bar would be only £24 and it’s so early in the day. There’s also usually a time limit of 90 minutes, even for people who don’t fall over, which goes against both the principle of brunch (an American import, possibly their only contribution to laziness) and that of binge-drinking (homegrown, signifying that, once you have started, you don’t stop).Recently, themes have started to spring up: a Mexican-themed taco bottomless brunch, a drag theme. I was snooty about these from a distance, believing them to be a calculated distraction from the main downside: that the other tables are fiendishly noisy. Something in that combination of drinking so fast, and the drink always being fizzy and usually stronger than beer – some mysterious alchemy – makes everyone shout their heads off. I hate being that person who glares at people who are laughing. Yet when I hear the joke, because it was delivered at 10,000 decibels, and it wasn’t that funny, but the blast of laughter afterwards could lift a toupee, I’m afraid I am that person.Anyway, as I dove deeper into the themes, I came across the West End musical bottomless brunch, and even though this was more expensive and I hate pastries and muffins, and I couldn’t drink 65 quid’s worth of anything in an hour and a half, you could rinse me for any amount of money for showtunes. The marketing for this kind of thing is usually heavily feminised “girls’ day out” kind of stuff, the language of the spa day without the wellness. This is in marked contrast to the original all-you-can-drink concept, which was (look away if you can’t abide international bickering) from either Tokyo or Moscow or New York or Ayia Napa. Someone I know who can remain anonymous (my brother) used to go to Tokyo specifically for the nomihoudai, which neatly translates as all-you-can-drink, a companion activity to the tabehoudai, all-you-can-eat, and had precisely no complaints except that there were never any women there. It’s possible he was just frequenting the wrong establishments. It’s possible, in fact, that he never made this complaint, I just guessed it after asking him for the 17th time whether or not he had a girlfriend. It’s possible that he is actually married, but doesn’t want to reward my curiosity by mentioning it.Nomidoudai tend to be really good value – about a tenner – but this is where the 90- or 120-minute slots originated, and there is a ton of accrued etiquette. You’re not supposed to take a sip until everyone is present, so people hate you if you’re late. It’s very vulgar to order five drinks as your final round – I don’t know why I called this etiquette, this is just “try to be normal” – and you should never try to tack a second nomihoudai on to your first. That said, you can always go somewhere else and do it again. There are bizarro places where you have to order everything you will want to drink in the first 10 minutes, ripoff joints where the drinks are ersatz beer and watery cocktails, and places where you can negotiate your terms with a tout outside the bar, but frankly, you could put that kind of chutzpah and language skill to better use, maybe start a gambling ring or fight crime.On balance, I feel that there are so many downsides, pitfalls, rip-offs and hazards to the bottomless brunch that you could save more money just drinking half a bottle of vodka before you go out. But the young people on the bus disagreed they were pretty adamant that if they could just shed the rogue elements of their group, they would be back next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65346bbd14d026faad15a84bdc287f2ea3c70bba/44_0_2984_1791/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f2682d51f9ce7bfb1bcd7926ac4996","title":"kitchen continental chefs on the 12 european dishes everyone should try","story":"From waterzooi to zur, there are countless delights on offer across the continent. Chefs from Spain to Estonia tell us their best-kept food secretsAfter all these years of Swedes working in French kitchens and Italian chefs moving to Denmark, you could be forgiven for thinking of European cuisine as one big homogenous offering, a pot not so much melting as melted into one big lump of Eurofood. But all it takes is a walk through a market in some new place for the untapped riches of the continental table to hit you. We asked 12 stellar chefs – some Michelin-starred, several of the World’s 50 Best, all passionate – to tell us about the local dishes they think we need to try.In Flanders we make waterzooi, a fragrant chicken stew. You boil a chicken with carrots, leeks and celery to make a stock. You take the chicken out and add a roux, to thicken up the stock into a white sauce, with a bit of cream and some fresh herbs, then you put the chicken back in and serve with potato or bread. Belgian cuisine is full of robust flavours and slow cooking.Peter Goossens, Hof van Cleve, KruisemEveryone is eating semla right now – big fat cardamom buns with marzipan and sugar, topped with whipped cream. Traditionally, you would eat them on the last Tuesday of February or the first of March, for Mardi Gras. Nowadays, people eat them throughout Lent. Bakeries all over the country compete for the newspaper verdicts of whose is the best each year. I make the version my mother taught me.Niklas Ekstedt, Ekstedt, StockholmI love roasted lemon-oregano rooster – garlic slices hidden in the thighs – with slowly baked potatoes, served with a side of freshly made slaw of fine-julienne lettuce hearts, lots of red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, dill and barrel-matured feta cheese. Families usually have this as a Sunday roast, but you can find it on the menu in any decent tavern or restaurant.Nikos Roussos, Funky Gourmet, Athens and Opso, LondonI am a Berlin native, and eisbein is something I grew up with. My grandmother always made it for me. It’s a pretty ugly dish and very fatty, as it is traditionally made with ham hock it comes with half a kilo of sauerkraut and half a kilo of yellow peas. At the restaurant we have brought it up to date. We have substituted the pork for suckling pig, so it’s less greasy. We flavour and cook it like my grandmother did, and then the Asian part of my cooking philosophy steps in and we deep-fry the meat, so that it becomes really crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. We serve it with a hint of the cream from the yellow peas, and we substitute the sauerkraut for pickled ginger.Tim Raue, Restaurant Tim Raue, BerlinI have always loved the texture of sweetbreads, the dish’s gourmet side. Rather than braising it, my grandfather André would cook it in a vol-au-vent and combine with crayfish. Sweetbreads are still very commonly found in this form or in a bouchée à la reine, with a mushroom sauce, as a Sunday starter for many families in France. The textures and flavours of my grandfather’s dish, which has become a classic of gastronomy, were part of my childhood. These days, I poach the sweetbread in milk flavoured with beeswax and honey, then enclose it in a beeswax shell and leave it to mature. Once ready, I cook it in a pan with butter. Anne-Sophie Pic, Maison Pic, ParisCalabria is famous for stockfish – dried cod, which is generally prepared with pasta. You soak the fish in water for three days, then slice it and add capers, olive oil and lemon zest. It’s quite a typical dish for Christmas Eve dinner. The whole preparation of the fish is a sort of ritual. I was always fascinated by how it was my grandfather who looked after it and not my grandmother, who was usually in charge of the kitchen. From time to time, I have featured the fish on the menu, in particular with ziti (short pasta) and ’nduja. Anthony Genovese, Il Pagliaccio, RomeLike most Basques, I’m crazy about fish and seafood. Txangurro a la donostiarra is a stuffed crab dish created in the early 20th century by a local Basque chef. Crabmeat is mixed with onion, tomato and breadcrumbs and stuffed into the empty crab shell to be baked. Our yellow-crab dish is a nod to this classic, still redolent of the sea, but true to our philosophy. We use collagen, cauliflower, spider crab and an in-your-face fashion-yellow shell. We are always playing with the relationship between tradition and modernity.Elena Arzak, Arzak, San SebastianZur is a soup with a lightly sour flavour that is very popular in rural Poland. It is made from so-called white borsch: whole-rye bread and crusts placed in a jar and left in a warm place for two days to ferment. It can be stored for up to two weeks in tightly corked bottles in a cool place. The soup is prepared with a vegetable stock of parsley root, carrots, leeks, onion and crushed garlic cloves, with dried forest mushrooms. You add traditional rural sausage, which you remove once cooked and slice thinly before returning to the soup to serve. You can also add lean bacon, finely cubed and fried. You serve the zur with potatoes seasoned with onion fried in oil.Zbyszek Siemieniec, Restauracja Wentzl, KrakowBlack bread with Baltic herring and boiled eggs is a fairly rustic dish that people usually eat at home on Sundays. The herrings are pickled with strong pepper and a bit of garlic, and the bread is savoury, salted and intensely malted. It makes for a beautiful dish, and will bring back memories for every Estonian person. It’s the first thing people miss when they are abroad.Orm Oja, Noa, TallinnFrika is a traditional dish of potatoes and cheese cooked in pork fat and served with mountain herbs. Shepherds prepare it in the Slovenian Alps, but you find something very similar in the Italy and Austrian mountains, too. Which is the beauty of the dish: it doesn’t respect borders it showcases the culture that we share. You heat pork fat in a pan, and throw in chopped potato to coat, then cover with offcuts from cheesemaking and cook slowly on one side before turning it all over and cooking on the other. The way the cheese caramelises with the potato is delicious. You serve it hot, finished with freshly picked herbs.Ana Ros, Hiša Franko, KobaridThe extremely ugly lumpfish comes close to the shore to breed around this time of year, so the roe is harvested and eaten fresh. It is classically served on a piece of toast with dill and some creme fraiche, as a light lunch or a starter. The produce is something you can only source right here, so it really is particular to Denmark. We have used it in many different ways at Relae, once with hazelnut milk and fermented celeriac. Christian Puglisi, Relae, CopenhagenBoxty is a semi-fermented potato cake you find all over Ireland, but I think it comes from Cavan, in the border region. You cook the potato out and mix it with flour and seasoning, then leave to age and dry for a couple of days or weeks, until it’s like a very firm gnocchi, which you can then slice. To eat it, you fry it in a bit of oil, finish with butter, if you want to go the full hog, then serve with runny fried eggs and smoked fish – kippers or haddock. It’s one of my favourite things to have for breakfast.Keelan Higgs, Variety Jones, Dublin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a91eb97526f75e3ba29857a3593b2994fbfc7b5a/81_159_3270_1962/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a35f45b7f998e8ab3cf82ec053ed852","title":"derby manchester united fa cup fifth round match report","story":"There was razzmatazz, a “Welcome to the Jungle” soundtrack and no fairytale for Wayne Rooney. Instead of a script with Manchester United’s record goalscorer haunting them for Derby, the visitors ruined the Rooney party and Odion Ighalo signalled he may have a future at Old Trafford beyond his temporary deal.As with the latter days of his 13-year United career Rooney was glimpsed only around the edges of a match that ended with his former side securing passage to a quarter-final at Norwich, and Ighalo the scorer of two goals to take his tally for the club to three.Pride Park had a kind of heavy-metal start that matched the noise fans created. Victor Lindelöf made a simple error, handing the ball to Max Lowe and the left-back speared in a cross. At the other end Rooney’s opening contribution was to slide – blood-and-thunder style – into Scott McTominay, which drew raucous cheers.The contest’s vibrancy was personified by Louie Sibley’s thrust forward and shot and, after Solskjær remonstrated with McTominay for loose play, United awoke. The effervescent Bruno Fernandes fed the excellent Luke Shaw along the left to earn a corner. Yet from this Derby broke via the lively Sibley and Shaw ended the footrace by upending him and earning a booking. The free-kick was in prime Rooney territory: his curled attempt circumvented the wall and required a ing Sergio Romero to steer wide.Fernandes has become United’s driving force since joining in January so there was relief in the ranks when, after lying on the pitch following a clash with Craig Forsyth, the midfielder was able to continue.United gained more control but still reached for the requisite slickness. Fernandes was a blur of runs, making demands on teammates to switch to his wavelength. Even when Juan Mata found Ighalo to force Kelle Roos to save, the pass was a rebound.All of this was forgotten when United took the lead. A Fernandes shot came back off Roos and Shaw drilled home, via the ground and possibly Jesse Lingard’s back, for his second United – and career – goal.This had the jubilant travelling support singing “Que sera sera, we’re going to Wembley” and Derby’s mood was about to be punctured further. Shaw dazzled with dancing feet that took him into space before feeding Ighalo, and now came an expert finish: the centre-forward wriggling between two defenders then shooting past Roos for his second goal since his loan move.It enhanced the impression that the Nigerian’s signing was shrewd business from United. What they needed in the second half was to show smart game-management. One mode is to operate up near the opponent’s goal: the sight of Fernandes finding Scott McTominay’s head from a corner was a good start. And the way Mata, Diogo Dalot and McTominay pinged the ball around between them a little later augured well, too.Even when Jayden Bogle swept a pass from the right out to Jason Knight on the left United eased Derby gradually back via the pressing of Eric Bailly. Shaw – doing a fair impersonation of Roberto Carlos – slalomed through Derby again and came close to adding a third.It was heartening to hear the United faithful regaling their former hero – a memorable experience for Rooney, even if this was because their side were coasting.With an eye on Sunday’s derby with Manchester City – for which the unused Harry Maguire’s “rolled ankle, hopefully” will be OK – Solskjær took off Fernandes for Andreas Pereira and Phillip Cocu swapped Martyn Waghorn for Jack Marriott.It became a night to remember for Ighalo via the left-foot rocket he hit into the roof of the net with 20 minutes remaining. This was followed by a nonchalant jig of celebration that found a mirror image from those in the away section.At the final whistle United were content and Rooney wandered off disappointed, though he had warmed Romero’s fingers with a late free-kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad3e06a47eaabb008cddab2842fa3f2eeabf687f/0_30_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13902e487ad153d97cefa741efffe57f","title":"england usa shebelieves cup match report","story":"Any ambition Phil Neville’s Lionesses had of asserting their claim to the biggest rivals to four-time world champions the US took a heavy bruising as they slumped to a 2-0 defeat in their SheBelieves Cup opener.It will not be the defeat that sees the pressure ramp up on Neville, whose side laboured to two wins in their seven games sandwiched by this tie and their defeat to the US in the World Cup semi-finals, more the manner of it.If attempting to determine which side has the majority of their players domestically in their off-season and which is made up of those in the middle of a fiercely competitive league season you would have been forgiven for guessing incorrectly. “I think that shows the mentality of this team and what we’re trying to do,” said Lindsey Horan. “We’re not in season so we’re not in full fitness and this tournament is going to help us out with that.” England’s passing was sloppy at best and the Lionesses were second to every loose ball. It contrasted brutally with the slick confidence and intuition of an American side that has not lost in 14 months.Neville, though, insisted he sees progress in a team many deem to be going backwards, one which has dropped from third to sixth in the world rankings since the start of the World Cup. “I don’t see a team that lacked confidence in terms of the way that we want to play,” he said. “I see a team that are trying to play the right way and it feels as if we are so close but yet so far at this moment in time, and that is how the players feel as well, we’ve got to overcome that.”If there was a feeling that any bad blood between these two sides would be watered down by the friendly occasion then the booming pyrotechnics and rambunctious chanting led by the American Outlaws fan group helped ratchet up the tension.The absence of Ballon d’Or winning forward Megan Rapinoe from the starting lineup for the USWNT seemed strange. Last summer she sat out with injury, this time the decision to sit her out was more about preservation of their 34-year-old talisman. The only change to the starting XI from the World Cup semi-final game was forced, the pregnancy of Alex Morgan meaning Carli Lloyd stepped in for her 292nd cap. Their biggest change was off field, with Jill Ellis replaced by Vlatko Andonovski as head coach.Phil Neville had been caught out by the benching of Rapinoe in Lyon, having broken apart the powerful Lucy Bronze, Nikita Parris and Jill Scott axis on the right to try and find a way to stifle the attack. Instead it had stunted England’s previous fluidity.Seven players remained from that game for England and, bar players missing through injury, the line up and formation was much more familiar. The addition of 19-year-old Lauren Hemp, for her first start, proved fruitful. Within the first 15 minutes the fearless teenager had tested right-back Kelley O’Hara. She was England’s brightest outfield outlet. “There was a girl there that played without fear. She’s literally a bull,” said Neville.Her performance was matched only by Chelsea goalkeeper Carly Telford. The number one saved smartly from a Julie Ertz header – the defensive midfielder making her 100th appearance who was described by Neville as “phenomenal” and “probably the one player I would take out of that team” – before pulling off a fantastic double save to deny Horan.The Lionesses were extremely fortunate to be level at the break with the US pressing them hard and high and Neville’s somewhat makeshift back line, with Williamson standing in for injured Bronze at right back and a not very defensively minded Alex Greenwood at left back struggling with the pace and slick passing of Horan and Press.It was only a matter of time for the US to make the breakthrough and to rub salt in the wound they hit two in two minutes. First, Press curled into the top right corner from 25 yards to cruelly end Telford’s resolute stand. Then, Horan cheekily clipped the ball into the run of Lloyd who had crept between Millie Bright and Steph Houghton before firing low past Telford with ease.The rapturous cheering for Rapinoe as she warmed up was rewarded just past the hour mark when the stadium erupted on her introduction. While Andonovski’s changes were, on the whole, like for like as they looked to see out the game, Neville’s were baffling. In a game crying out for more fluidity from England up top, the manager waited until the 81st minute before bringing on joint WSL top scorer and menace Beth England. By then the damage was well done and in the end the scoreline flattered the visiting team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/760ef693ad5247eda75a56f739a00a069c405995/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c622bb3e7f10a1f590d9fe719148191","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"A chance for Bournemouth at Anfield, Burnley and Spurs battle for European slots and Fernandes can seize big derby stageGiven their 22-point lead at the top of the table, no one at Liverpool is likely to be concerned by three recent defeats in four games across three different competitions. Of course, while a win against Bournemouth would help steady the ship and halt the onset of anything approaching mild jitters, Eddie Howe’s men will head to Anfield to face hosts recently derobed of what had previously resembled a cloak of invincibility. With Fabinho in poor form and Jordan Henderson still sidelined with injury, Liverpool look uncharacteristically vulnerable in midfield and are crying out for on-field leadership. While it ought to come in the form of James Milner, who returned from injury during their midweek FA Cup defeat at the hands of Chelsea, Bournemouth will still fancy their chances. There is never a good time for a relegation-threatened team to venture into the belly of the beast that is the champions-elect, but if you had to pick your moment, now seems a better one than any other. Barry Glendenning• Liverpool v Bournemouth (Saturday, 12.30pm – all times GMT)Well used to playing in a soulless, concrete, enormo-bowl largely ill-suited for footballing purpose, West Ham ought to feel right at home at the Emirates when they ramp up their efforts to drag themselves away from the relegation zone. In victory against Southampton last week, David Moyes opted to partner two up front in Michail Antonio and Sébastien Haller, an uncharacteristically bold move that paid idends with both strikers scoring and Antonio, in particular, causing Southampton’s defence no end of problems. Away from home, Moyes could be forgiven for reverting to a more cautious approach, but the prospect of facing Arsenal is not as daunting as it used to be, the Emirates is anything but a cauldron and with Mikel Arteta’s team often error-prone in defence, opting for a front-foot approach once again could yield handsome rewards for West Ham’s manager. BGUnited’s recent home results in the Manchester derby neatly demonstrate the shifting local balance of power. In their last 10 meetings with City at Old Trafford, United have lost seven times, winning twice and just once in the league, back in 2015. They have had much more joy at the Etihad Stadium, including a league win built on sharp counter attacks and stoic defence last December. The challenge on Sunday is to be more proactive, something that has not come easily in the eight years since City overcame their own psychological block with the 6-1 rout that began their purple patch. Bruno Fernandes, who has injected confidence and creativity since his arrival, could make the difference. The Portuguese playmaker is not afraid to lead the attacking charge, and was a constant menace against Everton. Fernandes’s bravado may help United come out of their shell and take on a City side who have won six out of their last seven away games – a run that began at Old Trafford, in the League Cup semi-final. Niall McVeighBurnley are about the last opponents an attack as depleted and blunted as Tottenham’s would wish to play at the moment. Sean Dyche’s side have conceded only twice in their past six games, four of which have been won and none lost. How positive José Mourinho will be in response to Spurs’ latest calamitous setback, the FA Cup exit to Norwich, will be one point of intrigue in a match that might be seen as a tussle for the Europa League places. Mourinho has more attacking riches than he makes out but Burnley’s parsimony at the back is complemented by their having the more in-form options going forward, with Chris Wood, Dwight McNeil, Matej Vydra Jay Rodriguez all posing a threat of late. In this context, a draw would be a decent result for Spurs but it would be unlikely to lift the angst in N17. Tom DaviesAll eyes will be on Danny Ings this week, with the striker set to return to the Saints starting XI after an injury saw him fit only for the bench in last week’s defeat at West Ham. With both Nathan Redmond and Stuart Armstrong sidelined for Saturday’s game with Newcastle, this is great news for Ralph Hasenhüttl – Ings has contributed 12 of Southampton’s last 25 league goals – but the return of another forward, Moussa Djenepo will be just as welcome. The 21-year-old returned to Mali last month for his mother’s funeral, and has understandably now come back to England with a heavy heart. “We are all helping him to get back to the Moussa we know because he was always the most positive guy in the squad,” Hasenhüttl said this week. Sport can often be a positive outlet for grief, as Billy Sharp so eloquently explained this week regarding the death of his son in 2011, and here’s hoping that Djenepo can find some peace when he crosses the white line on Saturday. Michael ButlerIt is now two and a half years since the Norwich coach was delayed by traffic on its way to Bramall Lane, the Canaries won 1-0 and Chris Wilder raged in impotent fury: “There might be a bit of traffic at a football stadium when about 28,000 are turning up. Do a little bit of homework and possibly set off 10 minutes earlier.” That incident, followed by the sides’ battle for promotion last season and the general closeness of their recent matches – this year brings the 10th anniversary of the last game between them to have a winning margin of more than a single goal – has created a rivalry that continues to bubble however much Wilder now plays it down, insisting that he was just being “a grumpy old git” when riled in 2017. Expect better punctuality from the Canaries this weekend. In other news, Sheffield United have scored precisely two goals in each of their last four games against Norwich the Canaries have scored precisely one goal in four of their last five games against the Blades there have been only three goalless draws in 72 previous meetings, the most recent more than 20 years and 22 meetings ago. SBBrighton have taken only five points from the past 24 available, in a run of eight games where they faced four of the five teams currently beneath them in the table and only Chelsea and Sheffield United from inside the top half. While Leicester’s success in making it to the FA Cup quarter-finals mean their game against Brighton on 22 March is likely to be postponed, Graham Potter’s side must face three of the top six (Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Wolves), Arsenal and their relegation rivals Norwich in their next six games. It is a comparatively daunting run of fixtures that begins at Molineux on Saturday, before a trip to the Emirates seven days later is followed by a two-week break. Getting points on the board before that hiatus looks imperative for Brighton and they can take heart from the four points they took from the reverse fixtures in early December. At home against Wolves they should have been out of sight by half-time in a match that finished up a 2-2 draw and Potter is likely to hark back to that stirring performance as he seeks to motivate his team this weekend. BGWatford sprung the surprise of the season by thrashing Liverpool last week and will look to continue that momentum against a Crystal Palace side that are all but safe. The Liverpool match was only the 10th this season in which Watford have been able to start their first-choice front three of Gerard Deulofeu, Troy Deeney and Ismaïla Sarr – the 18 points they have won in those games, which include two meetings with Liverpool as well as fixtures against Manchester United, Leicester, Tottenham and Wolves, suggest that with the trio fit they could get 68 over a full season, enough for Europa League qualification in 18 of the last 20 seasons and a Champions League place in seven of them. As it is they find themselves 17th and Deulofeu’s knee ligament injury means they will not all feature again this season, so the pressure is on his replacement – either the frequently ineffective Roberto Pereyra or the often injured Danny Welbeck – to raise the team to a similar standard. Only two teams have faced the full Deulofeu-Deeney-Sarr front three and not conceded, and Palace, in the goalless draw at Vicarage Road in December, are one of them. SBThe swagger Leicester showed in swatting aside Aston Villa 4-1 in December has rarely been seen since – with Villa among the teams to prosper from its absence in the Carabao Cup semi-finals – so this rematch offers a perfect opportunity for the Foxes to reassert their top-four credentials. Brendan Rodgers saw the midweek FA Cup win over Birmingham as a springboard for a revival. “It was important to get back to our game,” the Leicester manager said. “These players have been absolutely incredible through the course of this season – and their honesty will get them back to their level.” Villa in theory are comfortably beatable opponents, and travel to the King Power Stadium on the back of four straight defeats. The last of those was the creditable 2-1 loss to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final, which gives Dean Smith something of a tactical dilemma: keep with the four at the back to which he switched for Wembley, or revert to three central defenders? How much respect will he want to show a team who after all have vied with City for second place for much of this campaign?

Here, they recall the climate of chaos and fear that prevailed during the ship’s two-week quarantineChristian Santos* remembers staying awake at night, anxiously listening to the sound of his colleague coughing. They were sleeping below deck, in one of the small rooms shared by workers on board the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship.He had spent the previous two weeks serving guests who were confined to their rooms, and watching the miserable failure of disease-control measures on the vessel. Now he knew the coronavirus, which had already transmitted to hundreds of people onboard, had almost certainly entered his own cabin.He tried to move rooms, but was told this wasn’t possible. “Every time he coughed I was afraid,” recalls Santos, who, like many workers interviewed, asked to speak under a pseudonym. The next morning his colleague was taken to hospital for treatment.Santos has since tested negative, but as he and other crew remain in quarantine, a separate cruise ship is now being held off the coast of San Francisco after it was linked to a coronavirus death in California. A further 21 people onboard are reporting possible symptoms. It is not known if guests will be allowed to disembark.It is clear, said Santos, that passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess should have been evacuated far earlier from the ship, which became a breeding ground for the virus after it was stopped from sailing by the Japanese government. Crew, he added, should not have continued serving, cooking and cleaning while a quarantine was supposed to be underway.“We were abused,” said Santos. “Can you imagine? The situation was alarming but they kept us working.” He fears he could still develop the virus, and worries about losing work because of the crisis.Concerns were first raised about the ship when a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus on 1 February. Three days later, Japanese authorities stopped the ship from sailing. On 5 February, tighter controls were introduced and the 2,600 guests on board were told not to leave their rooms.But these measures, which some have speculated were imposed days too late, only applied to passengers. Crew continued to eat in a large mess hall, share bathroom facilities and go to guests’ rooms. Some departments received protective equipment later than others. Santos says he did not receive a mask until a week after the ship had been stopped.At the time, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital, an infectious disease specialist who visited the ship during the quarantine, described the procedures onboard as “completely inadequate”. In a scathing video posted online, he said he had worked during Ebola and Sars outbreaks and had never worried about getting infected but, after visiting the Diamond Princess, he was afraid of catching coronavirus.Crew members described scenes of confusion and chaos, in which there was little separation between the healthy and the sick. “As a crew you don’t even know who is positive – you’re dealing with them and you’re going around the ship, eating in the mess together,” said another staff member, James Reyes, who worked in housekeeping.Six passengers have died as a result of the virus.Princess Cruises said in a statement that Japan’s ministry of health was the lead authority “defining and executing the testing and quarantine protocols for all guests and crew”, and that the ship was legally obliged to follow the country’s public health and medical instructions.Japan’s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that Japan “presented a criteria of behaviour” to limit infection along with equipment, but that “the responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with the ship operator”.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Reyes isn’t sure who is to blame. He is now in quarantine with Santos, back in the Philippines, home to almost half of the Diamond Princess’s crew. The country is a major source of ship workers globally and depends heavily on remittances. Though most Filipinos are employed through land-based jobs, 330,859 people were at sea as of the end of 2018. Cruise ship work, thanks to its higher pay and the job’s glamorous reputation, is highly sought after.This can leave employees reluctant to speak out when they are being unfairly treated, said Professor Helen Sampson of the seafarers international research centre at Cardiff University. “Most workers are employed on temporary contracts and are fearful of losing their jobs, making them extremely vulnerable to abuse of many kinds.”The majority of crew members interviewed said they did not want to give their full name because they feared repercussions from Princess Cruises, or from their recruitment agency, the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (MMC). Some crew and their relatives said they had been discouraged from sharing information about the outbreak by posting online or talking to the media. Princess Cruises said it had not stopped staff from using social media. MMC did not respond to a request for comment.Joanna Concepcion, chairperson of Migrante International, a Manila-based group that supported affected crew members, said employees wanted to stop working but felt they had no choice. “It was almost as if they were forced to pick between their health and safety, and their economic livelihood,” she said.Messages given to crew onboard varied. In one department, crew were told in a group meeting that if they did not wish to work they must come forward and write down their names, so that their details could then be provided to human resources – an announcement perceived by some staff present to be a threat. Elsewhere, staff said they were not informed of any option not to work, and instead found their hours increasing as they were tasked with delivering food and other treats to passengers who had been confined to their rooms. Crew were also given treats and vitamins.Photographs shared online show a flood of thank-you letters written by the ship’s guests. Some passengers were frustrated by the quarantine, but most were extremely grateful to the crew, workers said.“We sacrificed our health for the benefit of others. Now that the crisis is over, we feel this feeling of pride in ourself, and in what we did,” RCDG said, adding that the captain and department heads were supportive.Others argue this isn’t a sacrifice crew members should have been asked to make. Relatives fear that Filipinos, who pride themselves on being hardworking, felt obliged to go above and beyond what should have been expected. “It’s no longer their job. It’s not part of their contract,” said the girlfriend of one man who worked onboard and later tested positive and remains in Japan.There is often a culture of soldiering on among crews, added Sampson. The ships provide a unique environment in which diseases can spread, and there has long been concern about the need to minimise the risk of outbreaks. “On all cruise vessels most crew, other than the very senior ranks, share cabins which are small and which are very unhelpful in regard to infection control,” said Sampson.Across the cruise sector, staff can be more vulnerable to illnesses – shift patterns can prevent employees from visiting the onboard doctors, and some feel obliged to carry on, especially if they are worried about being sent home. This, in turn, also puts guests at greater risk.The lack of agreement over who had ultimate responsibility for staff members on Diamond Princess – the various companies or the Japan or Philippines government – shows how “completely under-considered” such matters are, added Sampson.“Perhaps if anything positive eventually emerges from this global health crisis, it might be that cruise operators review crew working and living conditions, and upgrade these to provide for better physical and mental health, and welfare,” she said.More immediately, cruise operators have cancelled and rescheduled trips, and introduced tighter health screening and staff training in an attempt to reassure passengers. The virus has wreaked havoc across the global tourism sector, with the overall economic cost yet to be seen.Workers fear they will incur a loss of income. In 2018, seafarer remittances totalled $6.1bn (£4.7bn). Princess Cruises said staff members have been offered two months’ leave, and will be contracted to another ship.Elsie Lavado, whose husband is among those in quarantine in the Philippines, says she just wants her family back together. During the height of the outbreak, she locked herself in her son’s bedroom, praying for the return of her husband and all other people onboard. “The life of my husband is more important than money,” she said.* Names of workers have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97612a6181faa1db404b619924bd71e4699bdfc7/259_836_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8503931cdb0503ca485f70ce5fc2ffc9","title":"contacts of 1m virgin media customers left on unsecured database","story":"At least one person from outside Virgin Media accessed non-financial detailsAlmost a million Virgin Media customers had their personal details stored on a marketing database that had been left unsecured since last April, the company has admitted.Records show that the database has been accessed by at least one person from outside the company, Virgin Media said, although it does not yet have any evidence that the information has been used illegally.“Our investigation is ongoing and we have contacted affected customers and the Information Commissioner’s Office,” Virgin Media said in a statement. “We take our responsibility to protect personal information seriously. We know what happened, why it happened and as soon as we became aware we immediately shut down access to the database and launched a full independent forensic investigation.”The company warned customers that they may be victims of identity theft as a result of the stolen personal details, and advised concerned customers to contact Action Fraud if they think they have been targeted. The information would also be useful to would-be scammers planning to carry out phishing attacks or fraudulent phone calls, in the hope that they could convince their targets that they are the legitimate representatives of Virgin Media.Adam French, consumer right expert at Which?, said: “This data breach has exposed the data of almost a million Virgin Media customers and whilst no financial details or passwords were included, those customers are likely to be worried. It is vital that Virgin Media continues to provide clear information on what has happened.“For anyone concerned they could be affected – it’s good practice to update your password after a data breach. Also, be wary of emails regarding the breach, as scammers may try and take advantage of it.”Accidental exposure is a common form of data breach, particularly as companies move increasing amounts of valuable information to cloud computing providers such as Google and Amazon.

Anthony Browne, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, questioned the loyalty of Muslims to Britain when responding to Muslim leaders’ concerns about the Iraq war. Karl McCartney, the MP for Lincoln, retweeted Islamophobic and antisemitic posts by Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins. Browne and McCartney apologised for their actions.The MCB also highlighted the role of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s de facto chief of staff, in having responsibility for the Spectator website when a controversial cartoon of the prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban was posted, with a caption feeding into a far-right, Islamophobic trope about a Muslim “takeover”.Another example was that of Andrew Sabisky, briefly a No 10 adviser, who questioned in a book review whether a growing Muslim population would be countered with violent resistance.The dossier also includes allegations against Boris Johnson himself, who has previously apologised for describing Muslim women wearing face-covering veils as looking like “letterboxes”.The MCB first sent a file of 150 cases to the EHRC 10 months ago. However, the watchdog has resisted launching an inquiry until it can see the terms of reference of the Tories’ independent investigation into prejudice within the party.With no action so far, the MCB said it was sending another 150 cases and accused the EHRC, which launched an investigation in allegations of antisemitism in the Labour party last year, of failing to act on evidence of “institutional, systemic and widespread” Islamophobia in the Conservative party.The secretary general of the MCB, Harun Khan, which represents 500 Muslim groups, mosques and charities, said: “Having furnished the Equality and Human Rights Commission with evidence of over 100 incidents of Islamophobia in the Conservative party 10 months ago, we find it extraordinary that the commission has failed to give any response, let alone inform us and British Muslims as to whether action will be taken.“Two years ago, we estimated that there were cases of Islamophobia being identified in the party on a weekly basis. Now, with over 300 documented incidents, it appears our estimation was too low. There is no doubt that the Conservative party has an Islamophobia crisis. The party’s response has been one of denial, dismissal and deceit.“This results in clear discrimination against Muslims because of their religion. Islamophobia is never acceptable, yet this dossier cites hundreds of iniduals – including many in significant positions of power and influence – who have made horribly offensive comments about Muslims that would not be tolerated for any other section in our society.”He said the EHRC had a duty to uphold the Equality Act and called on the watchdog to take the wealth of evidence into account by launching a formal investigation.On becoming prime minister, Johnson had pledged to launch an inquiry into all forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia, before the end of last year. However, the terms of reference have still not been published.A spokesperson from the EHRC said: “We are actively considering what, if any, action we may take in relation to the handling of Islamophobia and other discrimination within the Conservative party. We are also awaiting the final terms of reference of the party’s independent review which we will consider as part of our decision-making process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ad7f597ae4a9f974f0866f8357edd1a98ed6563/0_0_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aba104afe9cd3b9a1aff7e463af92c6f","title":"build an irish sea tunnel not a bridge says scottish secretary","story":"Alister Jack says a tunnel linking Scotland and Northern Ireland would be cheaper and more weatherproofThe UK government could build a tunnel under the Irish Sea instead of a new bridge linking Scotland with Northern Ireland, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, has revealed.Jack told MSPs on Thursday he had raised the tunnel proposal with Boris Johnson as a cheaper and more weatherproof option than a bridge over the sea.He said he believed Johnson’s previous references to a bridge were a euphemism, and that the best crossing would be a tunnel – a theory he said the prime minister had asked UK government officials to investigate.“It would be less expensive to tunnel it,” he told MSPs on the Scottish parliament’s culture, tourism, Europe and external affairs committee. “It’s no different to the tunnels connecting the Faroe Islands, it’s no different to the tunnels going under the fjords.”Jack insisted there were longer tunnels in other parts of the world, and told reporters he envisaged the crossing starting as a bridge, then going under the sea for a 22-mile tunnel before rising up to be carried by a bridge again.He said that a bridge across the entire distance could be closed for up to 100 days a year by the severe weather which can hit the Irish Sea.His proposal was quickly ridiculed by his opponents. Ross Greer, a Scottish Green Party MSP who questioned him during the committee hearing, said: “These proposals might be headline grabbing but let’s face it, they are pure fantasy, just like the Tory approach to Brexit which Mr Jack so spectacularly failed to explain to the committee.”Proposals for a bridge over the Irish Sea have had support in principle from across the political spectrum, including from Mike Russell, the Scottish Brexit secretary and SNP MSP, and Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist party leader.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has not opposed the idea but her government was sceptical about the economic justification for sinking tens of billions of pounds into a crossing, arguing the money could be better spent on other projects.The leading option is to build the crossing from Portpatrick, near Stranraer in south-west Scotland, to Larne, north of Belfast, although a crossing from the Mull of Kintyre in Russell’s Argyll and Bute constituency has also been mooted.Critics say the bridge runs the clear risk of encountering a vast dump of more than 1m tonnes of old munitions dumped in Beaufort’s Dyke, a 300-metre deep ocean trench. Jack said a tunnel could avoid disturbing the spent shells dumped there.“We’re not going to just come riding roughshod and slam a tunnel in – and by the way, under the settlement of devolution, nor can we.”Sturgeon’s spokesman told reporters after Jack’s evidence that the idea of a tunnel was news to the Scottish government. He said Michael Matheson, the Scottish transport and infrastructure secretary, had written to the UK government questioning the rationale for the project last month.“If you’ve a spare £100bn, pick a number, it would be better off being spent in other ways, including a fair share for Scotland and Northern Ireland,” the spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/261cc02250e8136587e87ba15c53703d8c6a7e0c/0_39_5616_3368/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18599d6ae28e00b670f697754926ddec","title":"labour faces claims members yet to receive leadership ballots","story":"Several campaign teams for leader and deputy say that many people are still waitingLabour is under pressure to step up its efforts to ensure party members receive their leadership ballots amid widespread reports of glitches.Several leadership and deputy leadership campaigns have told the  their canvassers are picking up a large volume of party members still awaiting their ballot.The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters was due to open on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor - Starmer, Long-Bailey or Nandy - will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.The issue appears to be particularly acute for new members who joined the party after December’s election, believed to number more than 100,000, who are being subjected to a verification process that involves checking their address against the electoral roll.Polling suggests this group, as well as those who joined before Jeremy Corbyn became leader, are less likely to support his preferred candidate, Rebecca Long-Bailey.Some may have joined in the hope of voting for Jess Phillips, who was campaigning for new members to sign up, but withdrew from the contest as it became clear she was unlikely to receive the endorsement of any of the major unions.A second campaign described a “large scale failure”, with “many, many people” having to reapply for their ballots.Another Labour source, with knowledge of the process, claimed queries had been raised about the eligibility of thousands of new members, with staff unable to match their details with the electoral roll. Members are then contacted, and given the opportunity to resolve the discrepancy.Labour’s website warns members they may have to wait up to 10 days for a ballot to be reissued if they have missed out. Members can also use a self-service portal to make the request, but there are claims of a backlog.Chris Matheson, the MP for Chester and a Starmer supporter, said: “It is very worrying that two thirds of the way into this contest many Labour members appear not to have received their ballot papers. The general secretary needs to provide urgent assurance that all outstanding ballots will be dispatched as soon as possible.”Lisa Nandy supporter Louise Haigh, the MP for Sheffield Heeley, said: “Lots of new members who have joined our party since the devastation of the general election to have a say in our future have a right to their vote and it must be exercised. The party need to sort this out immediately and make sure all members are reassured they will get a chance to vote.”Voting opened last week, and will continue until noon on 2 April, with the result due to be announced at a special conference on 4 April. Labour officials declined to comment, but pointed out there is still plenty of time for queries to be resolved and ballots issued.Long-Bailey has sought to shake up the race in recent days by challenging Starmer over how his well-oiled campaign machine is being funded.Pressed on the issue by Andrew Neil on Wednesday, the shadow Brexit secretary revealed that the £100,000 donation from a fellow barrister he reported earlier this week was the largest he has received.Long-Bailey told Neil: “I think there’s always an assumption that you don’t get something for nothing in this world. And those who donate to your campaign will expect to be repaid in some way in the future.”Her campaign has received significant contributions from the Unite trade union, and from leftwing Labour group Momentum, whose founder, Jon Lansman, is chairing her campaign.Wigan MP Nandy, who has been more critical of Labour’s policies and approach than either of her two rivals, told HuffPost on Wednesday she remained confident she could still win, saying there were “a lot of members who are undecideds, who haven’t made up their mind who their first choice is”.She hopes to nose ahead of Long-Bailey, whose second preferences she would then hope to pick up.There have been few stark policy disagreements during the campaign, with Starmer adopting 10 markedly leftwing “pledges”, including widespread nationalisation, abolishing tuition fees and passing a new law to prevent illegal wars.Starmer received the backing of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown on Thursday, who said he, “has all the qualifications that are necessary for a prime minister of the future”.“A vote for Keir Starmer is a vote for hope. It’s a vote for the future. It’s a vote for the values that all of us believe in deeply,” Brown said.Long-Bailey has prioritised the environment, saying she would seek to make it a part of Labour’s constitution, in a new clause IV. And she has also focused on party democracy, calling for open selection of all parliamentary candidates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8b95b8c28422594309a2c514bf4623ace1bf418/0_107_2295_1377/master/2295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca0f18fdb79a2dc265f0c9379ea23498","title":"tory governments spend more on london than rest of england thinktank","story":"Centre-right thinktank Onward said budget is opportunity for Treasury to rethink prioritiesThe Treasury should stop directing so much money towards rich and productive London if it is serious about the “levelling up agenda” that Boris Johnson hopes will help him retain red wall seats, according to a report by centre-right thinktank Onward.Its analysis by Neil O’Brien, a Tory MP and former adviser to George Osborne, found that the successive governments have spent much more on transport, science, affordable housing and culture in London than elsewhere in England over many years.He found that transport spending was almost three times higher in London than the average in the rest of England since 2008 and the capital has received nearly twice the UK average science spending since 2001.London will also have experienced five times as much support for affordable housing between 2016 and 2021, and nearly five times as much spending on culture as the rest of England between 2011 and 2018.The thinktank said next week’s budget should be a moment for Rishi Sunak, the new chancellor, to rethink the Treasury’s priorities and stop the skewing of spending towards London and the south-east.O’Brien, who advised Osborne and Theresa May before entering parliament, said: “For decades we have piled fertiliser on the parts of our economy that are already flourishing while refusing to water the seeds of growth elsewhere. The PM’s mission to level up poorer parts of the country is vital.”The Treasury has been looking at rewriting its rules to permit greater investment in areas such as the north of England and the Midlands, after years of complaints that the current system overly favours London and the south-east.The change to the method of evaluating the economic benefits of spending could potentially introduce new metrics, such as improving the wellbeing of people in certain areas, or reducing regional productivity gaps.“I think as well as being good for the economy and the right thing to do, it is also good politically to be changing these rules that have existed for decades,” O’Brien said.Johnson has embraced an agenda of “levelling up” across the country after gains in the north and Midlands propelled him to a general election victory with a majority of more than 80 seats.Onward suggested the chancellor should “use every tool at his disposal” to improve regional growth and prevent government spending further unbalancing the economy. These also included proposals to devolve transport powers to more places in England and redirecting cultural funding away from the national institutions in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3213d7dd559233955a428a094c4fe7409691f24/0_92_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=955a93205838168685cc957f3b85cc75","title":"dog breeders urged to act over high levels of anxiety in pets","story":"Finnish study finds three-quarters of dogs exhibit highly problematic behaviourDog breeders need to take action to improve canine mental health, scientists have said, after research found almost three-quarters of pet dogs have highly problematic anxiety-related behaviour.While physical problems such as breathing difficulties and other health concerns relating to squashed-nosed breeds have become a hot topic, the study suggests breeders also need to focus on dogs’ behaviour.“Behavioural problems are the leading cause for the relinquishment or euthanasia of the dogs,” said Prof Hannes Lohi, a co-author of the study from the University of Helsinki.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on a survey of owners of more than 13,700 pet dogs in Finland, ning 264 breeds and ranging from young pups to elderly hounds.It examined the frequency of seven anxiety-related traits, including noise sensitivity, fear, aggression, separation problems and compulsive behaviour, as well as sub-traits within these categories, such as tail-chasing. For each, dogs were classified as having low, medium or high levels of problems.“We observed some differences such as male dogs being more often aggressive and impulsive, while female dogs were more fearful,” said Lohi.There were also differences by age: for example, high noise sensitivity was more common among older dogs, while destructive behaviour when alone – classed as a type of separation issue – was more common in young dogs. The team also looked at particular breeds, finding that while dogs of any breed could have any of the anxiety problems, particular traits were more common in certain types of dog.“As a result, selective breeding focusing on behaviour may reduce the prevalence of canine anxieties,” the authors said.Perhaps surprisingly, the team found that mixed breeds were more likely to show many of the various traits than purebred dogs – although the researchers say that may be because many of the former were probably rescue animals that potentially had had a difficult start in life and a lack of socialisation. The study has limitations: it is not clear if the trends would hold in other countries, and the team only looked at the frequency of behaviours and not their severity. It may also be that owners of dogs with behaviour problems may have been more likely to complete the questionnaire, although the researchers say their study was advertised to all owners and the findings chime with other research.Dr Rowena Packer, an expert in animal behaviour and welfare from the Royal Veterinary College, said a dog’s genetics and their environment each contributed to the way they act.“The way that both breeders and owners interact with dogs is hugely important in raising mentally healthy dogs,” she said. “This includes appropriate socialisation to people and other animals and habituation to day-to-day experiences as puppies, and positive, force-free training throughout life.”Packer noted that when it comes to heritable traits, too often the emphasis is on looks over behaviour. She said that because genetics and early environment set up dogs for the rest of their lives, breeders must do more to produce behaviourally healthy dogs. “Some of the behavioural problems highlighted in this study can lead to a lifetime of misery for affected dogs and an emotional and financial burden on their owners,” she said. “Tackling these problems through selection of behaviourally sound breeding stock, along with educating owners on appropriate interactions, environment and training for dogs, should be a high priority for all dog lovers.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff00fc259e2f0898650d6d84490da3ab95ddddbe/353_288_5351_3211/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3ae8faf516f0673b8f9858651f05e9","title":"oliver twist review artful new take on dickens is stunning","story":"Leeds Playhouse The Victorian orphan is given an even greater sense of exclusion in Amy Leach’s excellent production for Ramps on the MoonBrooklyn Melvin’s Oliver has a ferocious roar but no voice. Moon-faced and wide-eyed, she plays the Dickens hero as a lip-reading innocent. If Oliver lacks agency in the novel, he is even more adrift here where, without even BSL in his armoury, he has few means to express himself. But who needs speech when Melvin is so mesmerising?At large in a Victorian London made cruel by poverty, Oliver is at the heart of a politically astute adaptation. If you thought the crime, penury and violence of the novel were bad, imagine how much worse things would be if you were deaf at that time. In a production excellently directed by Amy Leach for Ramps on the Moon, a conglomerate of theatres committed to “normalising the presence of deaf and disabled people across the theatre industry”, the colourful cast of characters are excluded twice over: once by poverty, once by disability.Bryony Lavery’s adaptation incorporates this theme as skilfully as the production integrates signing and captioning. Forty years after the novel’s publication, an educational conference in Milan declared signing was an inferior language and should be discouraged. In this version, Jack Lord’s Brownlow is an early adopter of this exclusionary belief and duly dismissive of Oliver. All Melvin can do is blink back.The choreography of the ensemble’s signing is as beautiful as the filmic surtitles, creating a celebration of community that contrasts with the story’s dog-eat-dog inidualism. The underworld characters have few redeeming features, yet the production’s big-picture perspective never lets us think them entirely to blame in a society that criminalises people because of their poverty.

The world created on the page by novelist Jeff VanderMeer and then brought, frighteningly, to life was so endlessly compelling I craved more time within it, a two-hour film that could have easily stretched to a seven-hour miniseries. For his follow-up, Garland has smartly found a way to expand, heading to TV with Devs, an ambitious new series that allows him the chance to truly revel in a universe of his own creation, for better or worse.It’s always fascinating, if not always fulfilling, when a big-screen creative is given free reign by a network or streamer, the extended length and lack of box-office concern leading to a hitherto unknown freedom. But it’s a risky strategy for the viewer, and we’ve been burned before by some awfully indulgent shows from film-makers in need of a tighter edit. Devs, thankfully, is not an example of this and while it maybe runs an episode too long, it’s a mostly well-plotted and delicately paced drip-feed of information. Garland relishes the opportunity at hand without forgetting his audience.Devs focuses on a fictional tech giant called Amaya, run by enigmatic chief executive, Forrest (Nick Offerman). It’s based in the centre of a lush woodland in Silicon Valley, and inspires the confidence and compliance of its many workers, including couple Lily (Sonoya Mizuno) and Sergei (Karl Glusman). When Sergei gets a position within the company’s ultra-mysterious Devs department, he’s excited to finally find out exactly what it is that they do. But after his first day, he never makes it back to Lily, who is forced to explore where he is and what he found at Devs.It’s loosely familiar territory, recalling everything from Coma to The Firm to Antitrust to, most obviously, The Circle, but Garland deliberately upends expectations throughout – sometimes successfully, sometimes less so. There’s a murkiness between who we see as good and what we think of as evil, and while we might think we know where Garland is taking us, he slowly expands the canvas to reveal something far more audacious than a mere conspiracy thriller. He doesn’t take long to show us what the tech at its centre can do and although it’s an intriguing conceit, the motivations behind its creator aren’t quite as involving, falling foul of a sentimental and overly familiar trope teased by the title of the company.Because while Garland spends a great deal of time finessing the aesthetic of his show, he’s also keen to embed emotion into what could have easily been a rather chilly thriller. It’s Forrest’s backstory and Lily’s central loss that are supposed to affect our hearts as well as our heads – but Garland has lumbered the show with two sub-par performers who can’t even begin to sell either of their journeys. His visual choices as a director are unusual and immersive, but the negative component of this is that his casting often prioritises surface over substance. Mizuno, who made her feature debut in Ex Machina, has a stark, distinctive look, and her background as a model gives her a confident physical presence. But as an actor, she’s utterly, uncomfortably, vacant. Garland’s script constantly tells us how special, unique, strong, resourceful and determined Lily is, but Mizuno is such an absent performer, trying and struggling to muster up even the basest of human emotions, and so a great deal of energy is sucked out by her scenes, of which there are a great deal.Offerman is similarly miscast. As an actor known for more comic roles, he fails to add the commanding gravitas a figure like Forrest requires. It’s a one-note performance played to death I often wondered how two better equipped actors could have transformed the show.Luckily, they’re surrounded by some well-cast talent, including a self-possessed and faintly terrifying Alison Pill as Forrest’s second-in-command a spiky Cailee Spaeny as an enthused young coder and sterling work from veteran actor Stephen McKinley Henderson as her conflicted older counterpart. It also helps that even when the acting might suffer, Devs remains a gloriously handsome watch. A show about people working with computers might sound like a dry proposition, but Garland constantly expands and expands, intercutting the action with stunning, atmospheric shots of San Francisco, reminding us of the wider world outside of the insular universe the characters are inhabiting.Where it all ends up, in what’s set to be a isive finale, isn’t as satisfying, emotionally or narratively, as I’d hoped. But it’s a big bet I admired nonetheless. Devs is a show made on a large, seemingly expensive scale, encompassing high highs and low lows, the good and the bad and, by the end, the everything – and as such, it works and it doesn’t, aiming high and not quite landing, trying to reboot the game but giving it a slight update instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69b98a0a1e65134cb8a256e5fb6f78891b9ac938/0_149_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39db720e4919a88cc95d5b16e317cd97","title":"noughts crosses review a stormzy favourite is full of wake up calls","story":"Adapted from Malorie Blackman’s hit series of novels, this smart drama highlights structural racism by flipping a familiar tale of star-crossed lovers on its headIt is hard in this world for the oppressed white man – and I don’t mean Laurence Fox. This six-part adaptation of Malorie Blackman’s Noughts + Crosses books (BBC One) transports us to a race-flipped 21st-century Albion. There, the lighter-skinned Nought majority have been ruled over by darker-skinned Cross colonisers from “Aprica”, since their conquest of Europe, some 700 years ago.Our perspective on this alternative world is that of Callum (Peaky Blinders’ Jack Rowan) a Nought, and Sephy (newcomer Masali Baduza), who is not only a Cross, but, as the daughter of the home secretary Kamal Hadley (Paterson Joseph), a particularly privileged one.Callum and Sephy were childhood playmates in the grand Hadley house, where Callum’s mother (Helen Baxendale) is employed as servant. When Callum is roped in to help serve drinks at a birthday party for Mrs Hadley (Bonnie Mbuli), they meet again and rekindle their affection. This love across racial lines is dangerous, however, and further complicated by the involvement of Callum’s family in a Nought paramilitary group.If you were at school between 2001 and 2008, you will know much of that already. That is when the young adult book series by Blackman, a former children’s laureate, ruled libraries and book bags. It is hard to overstate the impact of the Noughts + Crosses series on a certain group of now twentysomething readers, but the fact that Stormzy (age 26) calls them his “favourite books of all time”, name-checked Blackman on his latest album and has a cameo in the series, gives some indication.So the generation who grew up reading Blackman will be watching, but the 9pm time slot suggests the BBC is banking on wider adult appeal. The characters have been aged up by about five years, making Callum and Sephy full participants in Albion society, with all its racism – both insidious and overt. There is a well-known example from the book, in which Callum gets a flesh-coloured plaster that doesn’t match his skin tone, and much more besides. Sephy has an exciting array of higher education opportunities, whereas Callum’s best option is to enrol in the elite Cross military academy, Mercy Point, even though it means being alienated from his community and enduring relentless racist bullying. As a Nought, he is also subject to brutal policing, the routine disrespect of mispronounced names and the highly charged slur “blanker”, which never seems far from any Cross tongue, even Sephy’s.Much of this rings discordant bells with viewers, which is down to the ingenious simplicity of Blackman’s premise. What distinguishes Noughts + Crosses from a counterfactual history series, such as The Man in the High Castle, or a historical-based fantasy, like Game of Thrones, is that it is barely fictionalised at all. This world is our world – same technology, same geography, same government – only flipped.In this context, African cultural dominance can feel like a celebration. Aside from all the other things it is doing, this show acts as a still rare showcase for black talent, be it in the form of more roles for black actors or a soundtrack mixing contemporary African music with erse Black British artists (currently available to listen to in full on BBC Sounds).Could such a show have been made before Black Panther exploded lazy industry assumptions in 2018? Certainly, some of that film’s Oscar-winning Afrofuturism is evident here, but it’s more than just brilliantly stylish design with political resonance. The Africanised architecture (shot mostly in South Africa), the way black faces feature on all the advertising hoardings and news channels, but especially the way Afrocentric beauty standards are so pervasive that even white characters wear their hair in locs and braids – all this comes together to create an effect that is consistently jolting. Every scene includes a least one detail that wakes up the viewer (and keeps us “woke”) to so much racism that is otherwise absorbed, unnoticed into the texture of daily life.These Noughts + Crosses characters don’t yet have complexity and nuance to match its world-building. At this stage, it is difficult to imagine audience interest in Callum and Sephy sustaining the show into a proposed subsequent series. Even so, this is vital viewing.At a time when the absurdity of media “debates” on race reveals this country’s general lack of understanding, a show that so starkly demonstrates structural racism is revolutionary. Because it’s not just about some pink plasters, is it?

It said the ban – only the third such comprehensive prohibition of a medical device in FDA history – was necessary to “protect public health”.The ban brings to an end a decades-long battle against the use of electric shocks at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC) in Canton, Massachusetts. Disability groups and international human rights organisations have campaigned ceaselessly to outlaw the use of so-called “aversive therapy”, where pain is inflicted on vulnerable children in order to discourage them from self-harming or aggressive behavior.More than 40 special needs residents of JRC, many with severe forms of autism, are understood to be on the electric shock regime. Managers of the center insisted the device was safe and pointed out that the use of shocks was approved in each case by the state family courts.But over the years there have been a number of scandals at the school. In 2007 a boy was strapped to a gurney and given 77 electric shocks over a three hour period for bad behavior – only for it to be discovered that the order to inflict the pain had come from an outside phone call made by a prankster.In 2010, the  gained access to the school and reported on its controversial practices. During the visit it was revealed that one student had been living at the center for 22 years and was still being shocked on average 33 times a week.A video recording also emerged in the course of a civil trial that showed a student, then aged 18, being zapped 31 times over seven hours. As he is shocked he is heard screaming: “That hurts, that hurts.”Supporters of the school, including several parents, say its practice of “aversive therapy” has improved lives, and in some cases saved their children from self-induced injury or even death.In 2013, the UN’s then monitor on torture released a report that found that the use of the device as a routine form of behavior control violated the UN convention against torture.Announcing the ban, the FDA said that it had reached this rare step because it had concluded that the devices presented an “unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury”. A review of the evidence showed that residents who were routinely shocked faced a number of significant psychological and physical risks including depression, anxiety, PTSD, pain, burns and tissue damage.The federal agency listed further possible risks including: “Suicidality, chronic stress, acute stress disorder, neuropathy, withdrawal, nightmares, flashbacks of panic and rage, hyper-vigilance, insensitivity to fatigue or pain, changes in sleep patterns, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, and injuries from falling”.Campaigners against the electric shock machines hailed the FDA’s ban as a huge advance.Laurie Ahern, who has led opposition to the devices for more than a decade as president of Disability Rights International, said she was grateful that the FDA had prohibited “the electric shock machines that torture children and adults with disabilities at JRC. Finally, the residents there might find some freedom from horrific pain and fear and live the rest of their lives in peace.”The FDA’s ban will come into effect 30 days after its final rule is registered. In special cases where iniduals need a transition away from the shocks on to other forms of therapy a period of 180 days will be allowed.JRC said in a statement that it will continue to advocate for use of electric shocks as “life-saving treatment”. It accused the FDA of reaching its decision “based on politics, not facts”, complaining that federal officials declined even to meet with parents of students on the regime.It insisted “there is no evidence of physical or psychological side effects”.An association of parents of residents of the center whose children routinely wear the devices and are zapped through pads attached to their arms or legs put out their own statement. “The FDA’s actions can only be interpreted one way – it is saying that our children’s lives do not matter.”The machines are known internally within JRC as “graduated electronic decelerators” – GED. They were invented by Matthew Israel, a psychologist with no medical training.During the 2010 tour of the school, the  was told by Israel how he had come up with the idea of using pain to discourage harmful behavior when he read an utopian novel called Walden Two. The book depicted a fictitious community in which negative behavior was systemically thwarted.Israel began experimenting with the practical application of “aversives” in 1971 starting with king with spoons and pinching. He then created his own electric shock machines.Over the years, understanding has grown of how to treat severe autism and other conditions in which iniduals can be extremely aggressive or harm themselves with head banging or eye gouging. The medical consensus is now that positive behavior support through rewards and teaching appropriate skills is both more effective and safer.William Maisel, the FDA’s top official on evaluating medical devices, said: “Through advancements in medical science, there are now more treatment options available to reduce or stop self-injurious or aggressive behavior, thus avoiding the substantial risk” the electric shock devices present."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa901045c947500a59b92c5de25758aab6b97ce/0_0_4333_2889/master/4333.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd4404a10619f58b00f2debc4487ac6d 720w","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 5 march","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Thursday include:More than 96,500 people have been infected by Covid-19 across the world, and more than 3,300 have died, according to Reuters.

This is Europe aims to rectify that.Why is it transnational reporting important? Because it is only when you start comparing and contrasting how different countries are experiencing the same challenges, and how they are addressing them, that you start to see who is doing well, who has developed best practice.It allows you, for example, to discover that perhaps surprisingly, Finland leads the way in tackling both fake news and homelessness. That France has a hugely successful consumers’ cooperative that is beginning to ensure farmers get paid a fair price for the food they produce.And that while it may represent a potentially existential challenge to winemakers in Bordeaux, global heating represents a startling opportunity for their colleagues – and, in the not too distant future, rivals – in Scandinavia.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. Migration, climate, populism and contagious diseases are continent-wide problems. When we report on them through a pan-European lens, we not only understand the challenges better but can tease out solutions wherever they crop up: health in Denmark, for example, or teenage wellbeing in the Netherlands.We’ve been talking about something similar to This is Europe for years at the , and now we’re doing it.It’s a shame Brexit had to happen first, of course. But if we can now report Europe as Europe – as a continent rising (we hope) inidually and collectively to the cross-border challenges it faces – more concretely and more informatively, that will be a small consolation.Be part of the conversation.

But at what cost to the environment?In the low-lying Gelderse Valley some 85km east of Amsterdam, a Dutch university is changing how humans eat.There, a bright-eyed press officer with Willy Wonka flair is showing me the miracles of modern food science. One laboratory door swings open to reveal giant, fragrant basil leaves growing under multicoloured lights. In a greenhouse nearby, thousands of tomatoes are suspended mid-air like plump, levitating Buddhas. A few steps away, I shake hands with a world-famous banana scientist, who dreams of introducing Europeans to the many varieties of banana eaten across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and ending the tyranny of the common yellow Cavendish.For miles in every direction, fields bulge with crops in some, drones monitor soil fertility, in others, giant luminescent panels light up greenhouses at night. The press officer is accustomed to impressing visitors. “What do you think?” he asks at every turn.The Netherlands is not a big place. You can drive across the whole country from the north to the south in under four hours. And yet it ranks consistently among the world’s top food exporting nations, in terms of gross value. The country’s surpluses are mind-boggling how does the second largest exporter of tomatoes and onions also produce such outsize quantities of dairy and potatoes, and export more eggs than any nation on Earth? The mystery of how this tiny patch of northern Europe does it draws government delegations, multinational companies and agriculture students from around the world to marvel at the nucleus of the Dutch innovation juggernaut: Wageningen University.Broadly speaking, humankind has two paths to choose from to confront what is about to happen. One option – we innovate our way out. Wageningen’s science addresses some of the biggest problems in our food supply system today: scientists there are developing plant-based meat, vertical farms and gene-editing technology. If the answer to the problem of humanity’s survival is going to come out of a laboratory, there’s a good chance that it will happen in Wageningen. Multinational companies and energetic startups are pouring money into the university the collective brainpower of 8,000 international food scientists is part of the machinery that will determine how humans of the future will eat.Louise Fresco, one of the world’s leading food scientists and president of Wageningen University, has been thinking about how to feed the world since she was 15 years old. In 1967, the budding scientist saw photographs of a famine in Biafra, Nigeria, and awakened to the urgency of global hunger. The images set Fresco off on journeys to Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she witnessed scarcity first-hand – in her book, Hamburgers in Paradise, she recalls eating roasted palm beetles and python in tomato sauce on these trips to poverty-stricken countries. “I contemplated how little was available to the world’s population,” she writes.Fresco was born in the aftermath of one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Dutch history, a manmade famine known as the Hunger Winter during the second world war in which about 20,000 Dutch people starved to death in a few months, as wartime rations in some regions fell to 500 calories per day. The echo of this event, encapsulated in the postwar slogan: “hunger – never again”, reverberates through my conversation with Fresco, and through many conversations I have at Wageningen. “I always felt that the coincidence of birth should be translated into some kind of a moral responsibility,” Fresco says in an interview at her office. “There was a great sense that something had to be done, that there is more than just going about your own life and being rich and happy.”The Dutch obsession with agricultural surplus is at the heart of the story of Europe. In the years after the war, the Netherlands’ agriculture minister Sicco Mansholt piloted large-scale mechanised farming. Mansholt wanted to secure the country’s food supply by increasing production. Heavy machinery, chemical fertilisers, and new research and technology were part of a modernising mission that Mansholt later evangelised across the continent as the first European commissioner for agriculture through the common agricultural policy. He sought to build a postwar Europe of plenty while lifting small farmers out of poverty and integrating Europe’s economies.Public opinion turned against Europe’s state-sponsored excesses, in favour of efficiency-driven American capitalism. Wageningen was suffering an existential crisis. “There was a questioning (sic) of – should we take responsibility, shouldn’t the market do things?” said Fresco, who at the time was a rising star at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and would have been aware of the waste mountains and the first international conversations about sustainability. Wageningen’s establishment turned to the giants of industry to keep the university afloat.Walking around Wageningen with Fresco, I am struck at how the town has compartmentalised the angst and suffering of the war in a small museum in its cobbled old quarter. The futuristic Wageningen next door is unsentimental and solution-focused. Its glossy, modernist buildings architecturally distance the lingering emotion of Europe’s history, and invite in only reason and logic. Big money propels Wageningen’s new swagger. Sleek corporate buildings of companies such as Unilever and Dutch dairy giant FrieslandCampina blend seamlessly into the campus architecture and the old university town has rebranded as “Food Valley” – a shiny agri-tech mecca with one big goal: shaping the future of food.This mission-driven Wageningen is providing dazzling solutions to humanity’s impending food supply problem. As an example, one of the university’s star scientists Leo Marcellis is pioneering new vertical farming techniques as a possible solution to producing more food without using more land. Marcellis grows plants in tiered shelves inside highly monitored labs. The potential of this innovation is immense, he says, conjuring skyscrapers of herbs and abandoned buildings stacked with vegetable farms. But there is a small-print environmental cost attached, Marcellis admits. His vertical farms require huge inputs of artificial light, and are partially funded by Phillips, the lightbulb manufacturer. Marcellis’ land-saving vertical farms, it emerges, will require quite a lot of lightbulbs.The close relationship between Wageningen scientists and industry makes many people uncomfortable. Dutch investigative journalist Vincent Harmsen from One World magazine recently went to court asking Wageningen to release information about scientists’ communications with Syngenta, Monsanto and Bayer, large agrochemical firms. The university denied his freedom of information request, and a court upheld the university’s right to do so, on the grounds that Wageningen University’s funding is partially private. But without understanding the relationships between scientists and companies, Harmsen argues, it is impossible to discern scientific fact from company-sponsored fiction.This proximity between science and industry goes all the way to the top of the Wageningen pyramid. Fresco is a paid non-executive director of the multinational Syngenta. She previously held positions at Unilever and Dutch financial firm Rabobank. She argues that collaboration between private companies and science is necessary, and can be positive. Her role at Syngenta, she says, involves advising the company about sustainability. “Syngenta is not influencing Wageningen. It is contracting me, who tries to bring some good ideas to Syngenta. We work with all kinds of industry because we fundamentally believe that these big companies have such an influence in the world that they need to be helped to formulate sustainable products and ideas.”Meanwhile, on an abandoned apple orchard in Wageningen, a handful of students are planting a forest.In it, they will grow pumpkins, walnuts and berries. The aim is to demonstrate that small-scale farming is viable and more environmentally friendly than industrial mega-farms. “Louise Fresco still thinks quite a lot in terms of ‘we have to feed the world’,” says Louise Vercruysse, one of the students planting the farm. “I’m not really into that. You have to first look at why the world can’t feed itself.”The young Wageningeners believe that profit-seeking industrial farming has driven the planet to the edge of crisis. The Netherlands’ fantastical food production messaging has hidden modern agriculture’s assault on the environment for years, says Vercryusse. Dutch bees and butterflies are vanishing at astonishing speed, while Dutch children are suffering from pollution-induced asthma at rates higher than any country on the continent. Nitrogen levels, caused in part by hyperproductive Dutch dairy farms, when mapped from space resemble a wound over the country. To combat emissions, in 2019 Dutch courts delayed 18,000 construction projects and cut the national speed limit.The activist students say Wageningen’s curriculum is still prioritising industry over the environment. To introduce new ideas to her peers, student Eva van Dijk, organises lunchtime lectures by Wouter van Eck and champions forest farming – where food is foraged or cultivated in ecologically erse forest ecosystems.Far from feeding the world – Van Eck tells the students, European colonisers destroyed the world’s indigenous food production systems. Eighteenth-century Europeans did not recognise the indigenous plants of the Americas, seeing instead only timber forests that needed felling. Now, he says, Europe is trying to export its broken agriculture system to solve a hunger crisis it created.Van Eck argues that the calculations used to bump the Netherlands up in the export rankings are misleading. They are based on the monetary value of exports rather than the quantity or nutritional value of the produce. The Dutch dairy industry, for example, buys huge amounts of fodder from Brazil, using up farmland that could be used to grow food for Brazil’s native population. To Van Eck, the idea that the Netherlands’ surpluses feed the world, is a hollow and dangerous lie. “The Netherlands is a black hole for food production,” he says. “Wageningen is not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.”Van Eck gets a rockstar reception from the auditorium full of students attending the lecture. A number of them surround him at the end to examine the baskets of forest-grown fruit and herbs he has brought along and ask him if they can organise internships at his forest farm.Activist students at Wageningen organise underground seed exchanges, encouraging farmers to bypass the highly regulated, industry-dominated seed market. Some organise events where they throw seed “bombs” into parks and fields to break the monotony of the Netherlands’ controlled green spaces.The students believe the rational response to ecological crisis is to produce and consume less, even if it causes an economic backslide. This idea is catching fire around the world. Economists like Giorgos Kallis who champion “degrowth”, say western economies have achieved an optimal state, and should stop chasing GDP-driven yearly growth and focus instead on limiting environmental damage. At last year’s UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg rebuked world leaders for continuing to pursue economic rather than ecological goals. “You are failing us,” she said.The young Wageningeners are aware that they will live through an era of environmental calamity that will shape their entire lives. Their university years lack outward signs of frivolous indulgence and instead are characterised by astounding personal choices. At Droevendaal, an ecological complex near the university, Van Dijk tells me the students bulk order organic produce like cereal and rice and share it between houses to keep costs low. Their primary mode of transport is cycling. They spend their spare time cultivating vegetable patches in their gardens and eat omelettes made from fresh eggs from chickens roaming the area. Solar panels provide their energy. Unwanted clothes, books and scrap are traded in a shed called the “Giveawayshop” to minimise waste.The students’ ideas, though, are untested. Van Eck admits in his lecture that his technique of farming is still a pilot project, and that he is not advocating for all farmers to turn their fields into forests. Scientists have raised questions about other alternative farming methods in the past. Many argue, for example, that some organic fertilisers and pesticides, though natural, can be harmful to the environment. Plus, lower yields on organic farms could mean having to use more land – which could lead to further deforestation.Disrupting food supply chains runs huge socio-economic risks, threatening millions of livelihoods around the world. In February, thousands of farmers in angry tractor convoys protested at The Hague, where parliament sits, fearing that debates about the environmental impact of Dutch agriculture could wipe out their businesses.On the apple orchard, the students agree that their experiments are only a starting point for the questions facing humanity. “I am still figuring out what I think the ideal path is,” said one, as I was leaving. “One thing is clear. The system we have now is not going to feed the planet without completely destroying the Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d62619b5a798caa1811d065f126e422ee1aa19f8/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c285c8d5dbd0662a268678ca113f2aa8","title":"mexico femicide emergency activists","story":"Many hoped Mexico’s leftwing president would take decisive action to slow a wave of killing. Instead, they say, things are getting worseby  Tom Phillips in Mexico CityEach day, María Salguero’s inbox floods with alerts telling the interminable tale of Mexico’s femicide crisis: “woman’s corpse”, “woman dismembered”, “woman stoned”, “woman stabbed”.For the past four years the Mexico City activist has made a daily mission of documenting the death toll, and pinpointing each of the crimes and victims on an online map.When Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected in 2018, Salguero hoped Mexico’s supposedly progressive new president would take decisive action to slow a wave of killing that last year claimed the lives of 3,825 women.Instead, Salguero’s research tells her things are getting worse: 10 or 11 women are now being killed each day, compared to six when she launched her map in 2016.And – like many Mexican feminists – she voices frustration at the politician popularly known as Amlo.“I feel betrayed, because I was one of those who voted for him,” said Salguero, 40. “We trusted that things could be different – but now we are seeing that this is just more of the same.”Salguero is not alone.After a politically explosive start to 2020, in which two horrific femicides sparked street protests and catapulted gender violence to the top of Mexico’s political agenda, many former Amlo supporters are expressing disenchantment.Masked feminists daubed their discontent on to the presidential palace last month with slogans such as “Amlo is killing us” and “Let’s abort Amlo”.“We all believed that with him things would be different. I thought this too,” said Frida Guerrera, a journalist and activist who recently confronted Mexico’s president at his morning press conference.Microphone in hand, Guerrera implored Amlo to do more to fight Mexico’s “femicide emergency”.Guerrera – who tells the stories of femicide victims on her blog - insisted she had not intended to pick a fight with Amlo.“I’m not Andrés Manuel’s enemy,” she said. “I went because I don’t want to write any more stories - and because I truly believe we must treat this as a national emergency – and they do not want to accept this.”But Amlo’s reaction did nothing to reassure Guerrera, or other women’s rights activists who believe the president’s response to the crisis has been haughty and evasive.Amlo has enraged feminist activists by insinuating a nationwide women’s strike on 9 March was part of a conservative plot against his government and announcing he would inaugurate a populist raffle for his presidential plane on the very same day. (On Wednesady he announced he would postpone the launch, saying he “didn’t even realize” that the strike was planned for Monday.)In another particularly notorious declaration, he attributed femicide to the “neoliberal policies” of previous administrations.Political scientist Viridiana Ríos said she thought criticism of Amlo’s linking of neoliberal policies with femicide was mistaken.But Ríos believed Amlo’s handling of the crisis had been damaging and counterproductive and stemmed partly from a conviction that the feminist movement was a political threat.“He is now really empowering the opposition, and more critically he is perceived as insensitive,” Ríos said. “What could be worse for a leftwing politician than to be perceived as socially insensitive?”As the killing continues, activists such Salguero and Guerrera busy themselves fighting to give femicide victims a voice.Each weekday, Salguero spends up to four hours up tapping details of the latest murders into her laptop. So far this year she has logged 320 deaths. Since launching her map in January 2016 there have been more than 9,000At the weekend, Salguero tries to forget: going bike riding, posting photos of cats and dogs on Facebook or listening to Norwegian black metal to relax.“This is how I get rid of all the stress of all this violence. Otherwise I would go mad,” she said.At first Salguero recorded only basic details of each murder but increasingly she tries to add “context” – the key, she thinks, to finding policy solutions that can stop the slaughter.How was the woman killed? Why? Was she pregnant? Was she alone? Was she raped? Was she thrown from a vehicle or dumped on a wasteland? Was the victim found clothed or naked? What kind of gun was used? How many knife wounds did she suffer?“Sometimes you see victims who have been stabbed more than 100 times,” Salguero said. “Just imagine that level of viciousness. It just show you how much rage these men feel towards women.”This year, as the femicide crisis has turned into a major political row, she and Guerrera have been targeted on social media. Salguero said some of the most venomous attacks came after she published the tally of women killed since Amlo took office in December 2018: 3,835.“They went for my jugular,” Salguero said.But she shrugged off such attacks and vowed not to abandon her map.“If the president plays down the problem then what can you expect from the rest of society? I feel that if I don’t do something then it could be my nieces next. It could happen to any one of the women around me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200f6fb45caeeeb890ce0963eebde00dcac0854b/0_181_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af1061eeda7da8ca768a60972a655965","title":"more than a hundred people in uk infected with coronavirus","story":"In a change of policy, some confirmed cases are now treated at home rather than in hospital A woman in her 70s was confirmed as the first coronavirus death in the UK on Thursday as Downing Street warned that it was now highly likely that the virus would spread in “a significant way”.It was thought she contracted the virus in the UK and had not been in contact with any other known cases. The woman, who was admitted to the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading on Wednesday, had been “in and out of hospital” with underlying health conditions, the hospital said. The unnamed victim was tested on Wednesday but results only came back after she died early on Thursday morning. Boris Johnson said that “our sympathies are very much with the victim and their family”.With the number of cases in Britain more than doubling from 51 two days earlier to 116, the government escalated its response to the threat from Italy by saying that travellers returning from any part of the country – rather than just the north – should self-isolate if they begin to feel unwell.And it enacted a major change in policy – announcing that some of those confirmed to have contracted the virus are now being treated at home rather than in hospital.“We’ve moved to a situation where people have minimal symptoms and they can self-isolate. It’s safer for them to self-isolate in their own homes, with support,” said Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser for the UK. “Anybody who needs hospitalisation will be hospitalised.”The first fatality was among eight of the latest infections where health officials have not identified how they contracted the virus. These “unknowns” are causing particular concern because they became infected while in the UK and had no obvious links to other cases. Whitty signalled that the sharp uptick in these cases had forced a new approach, saying that it was now necessary to move from the “contain” to the “delay” stage of the response plan.That would allow for school closures, steps to encourage home-working, and the reduction of large-scale gatherings. Whitty suggested that school closures would have only a marginal effect but that in general the change would “push the disease further from the winter pressure period, further out from the period when people have upper respiratory tract infections, and it buys us time to better understand the virus and start the research into vaccines.”Boris Johnson’s spokesman echoed Whitty’s concerns over slowing the virus, warning that it was now likely to spread significantly. The prime minister was updated on the coronavirus by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as he opened an official Cobra meeting, he said.“We will continue to try to contain this virus. However it’s now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way,” the spokesman said. “Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the delay phase of the government’s plan focusing on steps we can take to seek to delay the spread of the virus.”In other key developments:• Deaths in Italy rose to 148 with the virus infecting 3,296 people – a rise of 590 in 24 hours – in all 20 regions as schools and universities closed nationwide.• Greece closed schools, universities, theatres, museums and cinemas in three western regions after 21 new cases were detected among travellers who had recently returned from Israel and Egypt.• Of the 116 confirmed cases across the UK since the outbreak began in late January, 18 have recovered, 52 are still being cared for in hospital and 45 are being treated at home.• HSBC evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office tower in London, sending more than 100 staff home, after one tested positive for Covid-19.• Starbucks said it was “pausing the use of personal cups” for those drinking their beverage in the UK, US and Canadian stores to reduce the risk of spreading the disease.• The UK’s competition watchdog threatened to prosecute retailers and traders who take advantage of public concern about the coronavirus outbreak by hiking prices or making fake claims.• A leading football club executive admitted that the spread of coronavirus means it is likely Premier League matches will be played behind closed doors this month.The government provided a regional breakdown of where all the cases are located, after reversing a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the disease. That step came after Wednesday’s decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would lead to the spread of fake news.Whitty announced the reinstatement of daily location updates and admitted a “communication fumble” on the issue.The newly-published details of the geographic spread of cases showed 25 were in London. Two more cases were confirmed in Liverpool. The first West Midlands case was also confirmed by health officials. New figures showed an increase of 30 cases from Wednesday, 25 of whom were in England. A total of 18,083 people in the UK have now been tested.As the move to home treatment took place, Prof Steve Powis, NHS England’s national medical director, said: “If the symptoms are mild then it’s appropriate for people to be in a home setting rather than a hospital setting.”Asked how the authorities are ensuring that infected patients are staying indoors, Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England’s national infection service said that all were displaying very responsible behaviour.“Many are isolating in their bedroom and only coming out of their room to get food and go back in,” she said. “They are being very responsible. These people are making very active decision to isolate themselves.”Three new cases were confirmed in Scotland. The country’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said the new Scottish patients are from the Forth valley, Greater Glasgow \u0026amp Clyde, and Grampian areas. All of them tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with others who already had the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3753b2ea2c3621e06aa40fc69c5a179b8ef5ca/779_64_4933_2960/master/4933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a0a6315d58b61a6ecbc492dca5d276","title":"really stressful italians struggle to cope with education closures","story":"Parents having to use paid leave to stay at home after decision, disputed by some expertsStudents, parents and teachers are struggling to cope with the Italian government’s decision to close all schools and universities nationwide until 15 March as it grapples to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus. The virus had claimed 148 lives in the country by Thursday evening, according to government figures.“It is not easy,” said Maurizio Bufalini, 45, who works at a court in Ferrara, in Emilia-Romagna. “My wife and I had to use our holidays and paid leave to stay at home with our little daughter. I hope the government will intervene soon, otherwise it will be a disaster.”Schools were already closed in the northern regions worst affected by the outbreak, including Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Friuli Venezia Giulia, as well as parts of Liguria and Marche, but on Thursday the closures were rolled out across the country in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.“I have two children and the little one attends a private kindergarden which is not going to refund the monthly fee,’’ said Rosamaria Battaglia, 33, who works at a nautical agency in Palermo.“This week we’ll get a babysitter, but hopefully next week we’ll find a more economic solution. Being a mother and a worker in Italy is hard, being a mother and a worker in Italy during the outbreak of Covid-19 is really stressful.”The government has announced it is making €7.5bn available to help families and companies and is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for childcare costs and unpaid leave from work.“We should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,” Elena Bonetti, the minister for equal opportunities and family, told Radio Capital.Some experts and scientists have disagreed with the decision to close all schools. An authoritative source at the Italian Scientific Committee told La Stampa that the government’s decision was “evaluated as void of scientific evidence and above all with limited effectiveness if not carried out over time”.The government says it has the support of the scientific community and has the evidence to prove it. Many teachers and lecturers are continuing to teach students online.The problems are not only affecting parents, but students as well, especially university students who were poised to graduate in March.Roberta Bivona, 27, a literature student at the University of Palermo, was scheduled to meet a panel of professors to discuss her honours thesis on 11 March.“At first they informed me that my thesis defence would take place without observers, who are normally present as audience members,” Bivona said. “Now everything has changed with the closure of universities. Yesterday we received an email from the university rector, who is considering the possibility of thesis defences via Skype.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 4 March, the\u0026nbspglobal death toll was 3,190, while\u0026nbspmore than 93,000 people have been infected\u0026nbspin more than 80 countries.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 5,328 cases. More than 44,000 people in\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbsphave recovered from Covid-19.There have been 87 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. There are 53 confirmed cases in Australia, with two deaths.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.University academics are also struggling to cope with the closures.James Schwarten, an American university lecturer based in Rome, acknowledges the hardships the situation has created. “The coronavirus outbreak has generated a stressful predicament for university institutions that accommodate US study-abroad students, not to mention for university professors,’’ he said. ‘’This adverse situation has created a general climate of uncertainty as many students have already returned to the US, as well as concern for student enrolments in summer and fall, which could be negatively affected. If that scenario is borne out, many adjunct faculty members could find themselves in severe financial straits.”In the township of Vo’, the first to be placed in the red zone, schools have been dealing with closures for the last 15 days.A school in Lozzo Atestino, in the province of Padua and in the red zone, has been using remote online learning tools in place of classroom teaching.“We had to do something,” said Alfonso D’Ambrosio, the headmaster. “The education minister sent us 25 tablets for needy students. We are moving forward with our classes with excellent results … Our curriculum is important, but even more so now is to communicate to the students that the school is their ally. Some of the children’s parents have tested positive for the virus, and at this time we felt the need to support them.”Many experts have offered to help with the remote lessons, including Luca Vullo, who volunteered to hold classes on emotional intelligence for pupils in Lozzo Atestino. “When I learned of this opportunity, I was compelled to participate voluntarily,” said Vullo, a theatre director, actor and coach. “These are important topics in this precise moment, in which it is necessary to interpret and understand our emotions and our body.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1990742910aca3ee5d56cb27c2fbd76d9c377aba/0_109_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=899228314e1d69b109a44cae513944a8","title":"turkey deploys special forces as tensions rise along greek border","story":"Ankara claims scores of people trying to enter Greece have been injured by guardsTensions along Greece’s land border with Turkey have erupted again, barely 48 hours after European Union chiefs visited the region, as thousands of people, reportedly goaded by Turkish authorities, regrouped in the area.Ankara announced it was deploying 1,000 police special forces along the frontier on Thursday, claiming scores of people had been injured by Greek guards trying to stop them from crossing into the country.“They wounded 164 people. They tried to push 4,900 back to Turkey,” the country’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, told reporters after taking a helicopter tour of the Evros region. “We are deploying 1,000 special force police … to prevent the pushbacks.”Ankara has accused Athens of resorting to increasingly aggressive measures to deter migrants and refugees from breaching the frontier, following its abrupt decision to no longer abide by a landmark 2016 accord to halt migratory flows to the EU.In what has become as much a war of words as nerves, the neighbours – both Nato members but longstanding regional rivals – have exchanged barbs over the extent to which force has been used since Turkey declared it was “opening the doors” to Europe.Earlier this week, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Greek forces were firing on defenceless migrants trying to enter the EU state and had shot one man dead, an accusation deplored as “fake news” by the centre-right government in Athens.The deployment of special police comes after the administration of the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, also rushed to reinforce Greece’s land and sea frontiers with elite troops.On Wednesday, Greek riot police fired warning shots, teargas and water cannon to keep thousands of people from traversing the frontier, amid accusations of Turkish forces also firing many rounds of teargas into Greece. Authorities in Athens announced that about 7,000 illegal entries had been rebuffed overnight.The man often cited as the intellectual architect of the 2106 deal said on Thursday that European leaders had made a “capital error” by neglecting to commit to future payments towards the informal arrangement with Erdoğan’s government.“We need a new deal with Turkey,” said Gerald Knaus, who heads a small migration-focused thinktank.The pact had worked for the last four years, Knaus said, because Erdoğan needed the €6bn (£5.2bn) the EU had committed to the arrangement. But member states had become complacent about the arrangement and failed to sufficiently raise the need for further funds during recent budget talks in the European council, he said. “We’ve put off the decision for four years.”Knaus said suspending asylum claims on the Greek border risked undermining the fundamental rights that the EU claims to be built upon. “If Greece can suspend the right to asylum, what stops Hungary from suspending the next basic right? Viktor Orbán saw in the refugee crisis a great opportunity to end the era of human rights, and we risk proving him right.”The tensions flared as Erdoğan prepared to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow in a last-ditch effort to hammer out a ceasefire in Syria and avoid further calamity in the northern province of Idlib, Syria’s last rebel-held enclave.Almost a million displaced citizens have moved into the area as the Assad regime, backed by Russia, has waged a merciless offensive against the province. Alarm over the prospect of yet more refugees piling into Turkey, already hosting 3.7 million Syrians, played a role in prompting Erdoğan to “open the doors” to Europe.With officials in Brussels fearing the crisis is far from over, Frontex, the EU’s border agency, is poised to dispatch hundreds of extra guards and monitoring equipment to strengthen the bloc’s external borders. More patrol boats are expected to be deployed to Greece’s eastern Aegean isles facing the Turkish coast, where about 150,000 men, women and children are thought to have amassed in the hope of entering the country.A flotilla of gunships and coastguard boats already in place around the isles has proven extraordinarily effective, with police in Lesbos reporting no new arrivals since Monday.At the height of the Syrian civil war in 2015, almost a million Syrian refugees crossed into Europe via Lesbos alone. An estimated 27,000 people are currently housed on the island following a big rise in arrivals. Most are housed in Moria, a camp now seven times over capacity and widely regarded as the worst refugee installation in the world.With local tensions running high, government officials confirmed on Thursday that a Greek naval carrier would transport about 508 people who had managed to reach Lesbos after Turkey’s about-face to the mainland. They will be held in a detention centre before being deported under new emergency measures introduced in response to what Mitsotakis has called an “asymmetric threat” to Greece’s national security."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e4838c008a0d6e1d77f8cf15187225090f0fdb5/0_58_3478_2087/master/3478.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d12ef3731c0f37525bf0dff7b232783","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms infection wuhan china covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Clicking on the link takes the user to the website of a district office that lists the places the patient had visited before testing positive.This avalanche of information has included some embarrassing revelations.One involved a man in his 50s who returned from Wuhan province in China – where the outbreak started – with his 30-year-old secretary. Both were infected in the early days of the epidemic.In another case, reported by the BBC, one alert said a man contracted the virus from an instructor during a sexual harassment class.As South Korean media pored over their movements, citizens looked on with a mixture of horror and fascination as their private lives were laid bare, leading to speculation that they were having an affair and that the secretary had undergone plastic surgery.In another text that captured people’s imagination, a woman in her 60s reportedly went to work as normal, attended a wedding and had lunch at a hotel buffet restaurant with friends, despite having been recently hospitalised with injuries she said she had sustained in a car accident.The woman, who then tested positive for Covid-19, was accused by South Korean internet users of committing insurance fraud – allegations she denied publicly after TV reporters managed to track her down.A man in his 30s who tested positive became the target of online taunts about his sexual behaviour after authorities said in a text alert that they had been unable to track his movements after he arrived at Seoul’s main railway station from the capital’s airport.Since the area near the station is known for prostitution, the man, known only by his case number, was repeatedly accused on online forums of paying for sex. In fact, he had simply eaten at a restaurant in the neighbourhood, health authorities said, blaming the earlier confusion over his whereabouts on a technical glitch.The text alerts are also affecting shops and restaurants that infected people visited before their diagnosis was confirmed. While the texts do not identify the patients – other than giving their gender, age range and assigning them a case number – they do reveal the names of shops and restaurants they visited before they were tested.While restaurants that had been named closed temporarily for fumigation, they say the their association with the virus could put them out of business.Fraudsters are now playing on those fears. A man claiming to be infected with Covid-19 called several restaurants in the Mapo district of Seoul warning that their business would suffer if he told health authorities he had eaten there, and demanded money in return for his silence. Police are investigating the case but have yet to locate the suspect.“I find myself eavesdropping on customers’ conversations these days, just in case they turn out to be a cult member or a fraudster,” said Kim Na-hee, the owner of a restaurant in the capital. Most of South Korea’s cases have been linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect.Kim added: “I thought I only had to protect my health, but now I think there are other things more scary than the coronavirus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d3dc70daac2378dc179cc8cf864c266637562ae/0_300_5954_3572/master/5954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fefb51f701d13ce93dfb1ae154c8fcd0","title":"coronavirus live updates italy germany pandemic europe uk us australia india update latest news","story":"We are going to close this blog now, thanks for reading. For all the latest coronavirus updates please check our new blog.We’ll be pausing the live blog for now. And here’s our glanceable summary of developments today:A coronavirus test developed by a US diagnostics company will be available for healthcare providers to order later today.The US government is ramping up efforts to increase its ability to identify the coronavirus and an ongoing struggle to expand local testing has led to criticism.Health officials said earlier today they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people.Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover up to 1.7m people by the end of next week, US health and human services secretary Alex Azar said.The news of Laboratory Corp of America Holdings (LabCorp) tests comes as Quest Diagnostics and OPKO Health also said they would be able to begin testing for the virus from next week.The FDA has said it will allow some laboratories to immediately use the tests they have developed and validated while they await emergency-use authorisation from the US health regulator.Co-Diagnostics Inc said it was seeing a surge in demand for its coronavirus test kits following the FDA policy change.Previously, only testing kits developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of which were found to be faulty, could be used in public health labs, Reuters reported. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect the lab tests developed by Quest and LabCorp to be priced around $45 to $50, similar to a flu test.Religious groups have issued guidance for worshippers on practices including hand-shaking, sharing hymn books and taking communion wine as the spread of coronavirus intensifies across the UK, PA Media report.Varying levels of precaution have been taken by different faiths in a bid to protect congregations from catching the illness. Quakers have been urged not to shake hands as they would normally at the end of their meetings, while Catholics in some dioceses are being advised not to offer their hands for the sign of peace.Paul Parker, recording clerk for Quakers in Britain, said: Like many organisations that hold regular meetings, we have given advice on taking sensible precautions without raising anxiety.Quakers usually shake hands at the end of their meetings for worship, as an expression of unity. But the act of shaking hands itself is not a core part of Quaker faith and there are many other ways Quakers can share this greeting.We have advised meetings that they shouldn’t shake hands in the current situation.A spokesman for the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales said dioceses across the country would soon be moving into “stage two” of precautionary measures.This would include suspending the physical sign of peace – a handshake – removal of holy water stoups and shared hymn books, as well as advising elderly parishioners to stay at home.Catering at large parish gatherings where multiple people touch mugs and utensils would also be suspended, as would the passing round of collection plates during mass.The spokesman added that the decision might be taken by bishops in “remote parts of England” to not advance precautions in their dioceses.“No one size fits all and we are between stages, but my sense is that we are probably fast moving towards stage two,” he said.It added that no pastoral visits should be undertaken to people who are self-isolating but that “phone support” should still be provided.A spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said that much of the NHS advice and an emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene was “in line with Islamic tradition”.In a statement, the MCB said “mosques, madrassas and Muslim community centres should already be following best hygiene practices”.The seven new cases of coronavirus detected in Ireland include the first confirmed case of community transmission, since the patient had not travelled to an infected area.The case of community transmission is a man in Cork with an underlying medical condition. He had not travelled to Italy or been in contact with other confirmed cases.He is being treated at Cork University Hospital, which announced it was cancelling outpatient appointments on Friday.Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the country remains in the containment phase, but warned it is a “rapidly evolving situation” and urged a “national effort” to stymie potential spread.Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission.Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. Most people who become infected with covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some.However, this will need a national effort. Every inidual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others.The Health Service Executive said in a statement on Thursday night it was working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients may have had to prevent further spread.One of the cases confirmed on Wednesday – a member of a family of four in the west of Ireland – is a health professional, it has emerged.Four of the latest cases are travel related from northern Italy, involving four males from the east of the country. Two are associated with close contact with a confirmed case and involve two females in the west of the country.The seventh case is a male, who the Department of Health have described as being “associated with Cork University Hospital” and that is the first case of community transmission. A risk assessment is under way at the hospital.There are now 13 confirmed covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland, as well as three in Northern Ireland - bringing the total number of cases on the island to 16.There are 142 Britons stranded on another Princes Cruises ship, off the coast of California, and the passengers are being tested for the coronavirus.The cruise operator said groups of guests and crew were being tested after a passenger on an earlier voyage died and at least one other became infected.It confirmed that 142 UK nationals - made up of 121 passengers and 21 crew - were on board the Grand Princess, which was carrying a total of 3,533 people.There had so far been no confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board, and that fewer than 100 people had been identified for testing, according to the operator.“Public health officials have advised that no guests will be permitted to disembark until all results have been received,” it said.“Out of an abundance of caution, all guests who have been identified for testing have been asked to remain in their staterooms.”Japanese authorities said last week that a British tourist who had been on board another of the company’s cruise ships, the Diamond Princess - which was quarantined in Japan - had died after contracting coronavirus.Meanwhile, it has emerged that three passengers on the Grand Princess’ previous voyage have been confirmed to have the new virus, and one of them reportedly became California’s first fatality from the illness yesterday, after it disembarked hundreds at four Mexican ports last month.US health officials are working to track down other passengers who have returned home, but when Mexican health officials have not yet been notified by their counterparts, the Associated Press reported.Liverpool council has tweeted that two more cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed in Liverpool, bringing the total to three. “One is a known contact of an existing patient and the other has recently returned from Italy,” it said. “The patients are receiving specialist treatment.”Seven new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland today, bringing the total number of cases to 13, according to Irish media. A further three cases have been confirmed in Northern Ireland.People who have returned to the UK from any part of Italy in the past fortnight are being advised to self-isolate if they begin to feel unwell.Previously, the advice applied only to travellers who had visited the northern regions where the first deaths from the coronavirus were recorded, but the government has now announced that the guidance is being extended to cover the whole country.Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said the move was needed because of the evolving situation in Italy. He told a press conference earlier this evening:The situation in Italy means that we have decided it is prudent at this point to move from a geographical area of north Italy... to a geographical situation for all of Italy.The pattern of what people do is exactly the same as before. It’s about people from those areas, except for the cities which the Italian government specifies in lockdown, all other areas, only people who have got symptoms need to self-isolate.The number of confirmed covid-19 cases in Australia has climbed past 50, and include a baby diagnosed in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory.In New South Wales, Epping Boys high school in Sydney’s north will be closed on Friday after a student tested positive, and 61 staff at Sydney’s Ryde Hospital have been placed in self-isolation after 56 patients were identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case.At Liverpool hospital, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Elsewhere, in Brisbane and Sydney, nursing home staff have been forced into isolation after coming into contact with the virus.The federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, and New South Wales authorities have said they were trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus.Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was “millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks”. However, he said the country’s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cba6646f093e2193b239694358fd55d15bb29f/0_425_6378_3827/master/6378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83aee862ba068fa2f301b85dcde05d28","title":"coronavirus update latest live news symptoms cases global infection rate uk usa australia italy china updates","story":"Pence acknowledges shortage of testing kits WHO warns of sustained community transmission first death in UK.

We are now going through the caveats attached to these findings.The estimates, which were drawn on those “exported” cases from Wuhan to their home countries, were also based on people well enough to travel, he says, so might have slightly underestimated the prevalence in Wuhan, “due to not including those who are already in a serious condition and, for example, hospitalised.”Precise fatality risks estimates might not generalise to those outside Wuhan, because it has an explosive outbreak at the beginning, in a stressed health system without much experience treating it.Dr Leung and Dr Wu are now taking questions: What are the implications of your estimate on containment and mitigation of the virus?Leung: “The fear has always been: ‘Is this another 1918?’ The straight definitive answer is no.”“But some have…dismissively said, ‘Oh it’s just like the flu’. It’s not.” Covid-19 is deadlier than the swine flu pandemic, let alone the seasonal flu, Leung says.“Hong Kong does not have a self sustainable epidemic at hand yet and we need to keep up our alertness and interventions… to protect ourselves and others,” he says.“The longer we can hold on to containment, the few people arguing to get sick.”“This is where lives are at stake, particularly older adults over the age of 60 and 70.South Korea has vowed ‘reciprocal’ countermeasures to Japan’s coronavirus travel limitsSouth Korea said on Friday it will consider countermeasures to Japan’s “unjust, unacceptable” travel restrictions barring visitors from areas which have been hard hit by the coronavirus epidemic, Reuters reports. The presidential National Security Council met after Japan said it would bar arrivals from highly affected areas in South Korea and Iran and order a two-week quarantine for those from other regions. “It is unacceptable that the Japanese government took such an unjust action without prior consultations with us, and we will explore necessary countermeasures based on principles of reciprocity,” the council said in a statement.The WHO’s Professor Gabriel Leung says the Covid-19 epidemic is somewhere between the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics.Leung compares the new coronavirus outbreak to Sars, Mers, 1918 influenza pandemic, and the 2009 influenza pandemic:With Mers, we were only able to observe among those hospitalised, he says.“This is not the 1918 pandemic… But on the other hand it is not the 2009 swine flu pandemic either. It is much more severe, much more fatal.” “There is still one remaining uncertainty - out of those infected, what is the proportion who show symptoms?”“We are close to 100,000 cases already. I’m sure that the actual number is several times that at least,” says Leung.“So while the rest of the world is still in the stuttering beginnings of the first wave, the eventual final epidemic size is going to be many times larger.”“This is a very serious concern, especially among the older adult population.”In Hong Kong, there are some significant numbers coming from this press conference with Professor Jospeh Wu, of Hong Kong University Medical school of public health, and the WHO’s Professor Leung. Professor Wu is explaining that they have previously concentrated on the Wuhan rates, because that’s where the most deaths were, also using “export” rates of infection: that is the confirmed cases found among people on the charter flights out of Wuhan back to their home countries.Countries have different left levels and different testing capabilities. For example, Singapore likely has one of the highest testing rates, says Wu.As the number of coronavirus cases in South Korea exceeded 6,000 this week, there was a rise, too, in complaints about information overload in the form of emergency virus text alerts that have included embarrassing revelations about infected people’s private lives.Health authorities and district offices across the country are sending “safety guidance texts” from early morning to late at night, reminding people to wash their hands thoroughly and not to touch their faces with unwashed hands.But for many people, the texts – while intended as a public health service – are fuelling social stigma and in some cases, leading to speculation over extra-marital affairs.Much of the criticism centres on messages that trace the movements of people who have recently been diagnosed with the virus.“A woman in her 60s has just tested positive,” reads a typical text, “Click on the link for the places she visited before she was hospitalised,” it adds. More from Hong Kong now, where WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control founding director Professor Gabriel Leung is speaking. HSBC Holdings PLC has sent home more than 100 staff in London after a worker tested positive for the coronavirus, the first known case at a major company in Europe’s main financial hub, Reuters reports. The bank also has an employee in China with the virus who is in a stable condition, interim Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in an internal memo seen by Reuters. Banks worldwide are readying out-of-town offices and isolating some teams to ensure trading operations continue if the virus spreads to more financial centres. Italy’s UniCredit also sent home some staff after two new infections among its employees, one each in Germany and Italy. JPMorgan is moving traders in New York and London to a number of locations, it said in a memo on Thursday.Still in Hong Kong, Professor Gabriel Leung is carefully walking journalists through the data and science around coronavirus fatality rates. “This is the wrong number and will continue to be wrong unless and until the entire epidemic has run its full course.”There hasn’t been sufficient time for the cases to resolve clinically, so it’s bad data essentially. You shouldn’t be counting a case that presented yesterday, because who knows how they will fare in the coming weeks.“You are only including every case that has resolved - they have died or they have recovered,” he says.“But you haven’t actually estimated the total number of infected cases… because you haven’t tested everybody.”Turning to Hong Kong now. Fatality rates are one of the most concerning and confusing aspects of the global outbreak, particularly with varying levels of testing and of reporting transparency from different nations.In Hong Kong reporters are hearing from Professor Jospeh Wu, of Hong Kong University Medical school of public health, and Professor Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine HKU Medical school and founding director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control.“We have noticed in the last few days there has been intense discussion about the potential fatality risk of Covid-19, and what we have been concentrating our work on, is precisely on estimating the fatality risk,” says Leung.A family from Queensland, Australia have ordered enough toilet paper to last them 12 years, they estimate. The ABC reports that the Janetzki family in Toowoomba mistakenly ordered 80 boxes instead of 48 rolls of “Australia’s most sought-after product,” the ABC reports. Panic buying has left shelves empty of toilet paper across the country, with one supermarket chain imposing rations on customers.“They received 2,304 rolls and were charged $3,264 instead of $68, something that went unnoticed until the two-pallet order showed up on their doorstep days later.”Vice President Mike Pence held a joint press conference with Washington State Governor Jay Inslee Thursday evening in which he detailed plans to distribute millions of coronavirus test kits across the country. Standing in front of an American flag and surrounded by masks and other emergency supplies at Camp Murray, Pence said there will be 1.2 million test kits delivered in the next few days and 4 million by next week. He said in the “not too distant future,” the public could also expect getting tests from their doctor and local pharmacy.In response to a question about President Trump’s remarks on Wednesday in which he disputed the coronavirus death rate presented by the World Health Organization, Pence said he supports the president’s judgement and that the number may prove to be lower than previously reported.Inslee, who has had a noticeably isive relationship with Trump, said they don’t have the luxury of debating this issue right now. “I have had more than a very robust disagreements with the current president but I want to focus today on the work we need to do in partnership,” he said. “And I can tell you that I think this is a good partnership moving forward.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4194394.1583436237!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wet wipes wash up on beach litter list in coastwatch report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWet wipes made their debut appearance as a category on the Coastwatch Autumn Survey, which examines 541 sites around the country. File photograph: GettyWet wipes have been identified for the first time as a separate category of waste in the list of household materials littering Ireland’s beaches.A Coastwatch report published on Friday shows that wipes, favoured by many for their ease of use in daily cleaning, have been located on 12.2 per cent of the country’s shoreline.While many other materials including plastic bottles are on the decline, wet wipes made their debut appearance as a category on the Coastwatch Autumn Survey, which examines 541 sites around the country. They were previously measured as part of sewage material.“Once wet, wipes form ropes, it is impossible to count them, while those released onto a beach as free floating wipes tend to lie down flat like a plaster on the sand and then get quickly covered by more sediment.“Those used in the bathroom, replacing or augmenting toilet paper, are the most problematic as an unknown number get flushed down the toilet.”VolunteersCoastwatch has been carrying out its annual analysis since 1987 last autumn saw more than 1,100 volunteers trawl hundreds of sections of beach and shoreline measuring at least 500m each.As this is the first survey to include wet wipes as a standalone item, there is no data on the growth or decline in their prevalence. However, Karin Dubsky, Coastwatch Europe co-ordinator, said there were concerns around their use, which appears to be fuelled by cheap prices.The report recommends the issue is addressed immediately by way of increased directions on packaging against flushing wipes down toilets as well as a public awareness campaign.Elsewhere, the data showed 877 tyres were found on one in five sites. Landfill materials were recorded on 16.3 per cent of shoreline while bags, boxes and loose heaps of household refuse were found in 5 per cent.Despite the range of materials, the survey does deliver some encouraging news. Six of seven categories – plastic bottles, glass bottles, metal cans, bottle lids, plastic shopping bags and cartons – all reduced in volume.The only category to increase was “other”, comprising inidually counted items such as single-use cups, cotton buds, cigarette butts and wrappers. Balloons, golf balls, farm plastic and full dog waste bags also featured across several sites.Despite some waste reductions, the report sounds a note of caution in that its findings reflect “a fraction of what is collected in weekly and daily shore cleans all over the island on over 7,300km” of coast."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4194400.1583437146!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus hundreds of irish cases expected within fortnight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn emergency department nurse during a demonstration of the coronavirus pod and Covid-19 virus testing procedures at Antrim Area Hospital.

Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Ireland remains in containment phase with just one case of community transmission. This is, however, a rapidly evolving situation. Public health doctors are working hard to ensure our containment measures are operating effectively. “Most people who become infected with Covid-19 experience a mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for some. “However, this will need a national effort. Every inidual needs to be aware of how to protect their own health and the health of others.” Despite the increase in cases, Dr Holohan said he was not alarmed. “This is what we would have anticipated. It matches the pattern of most other countries’ experience.”He said the number of cases was “still small” and officials were confident they can prevent significant further transmission.Other than the case in Cork, he said, public health officials could explain how the patients involved were infected.CUHIn relation to the Cork case, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said the Cork University Hospital had put in place “robust, immediate actions that put patient safety first”.These include the cancellation of elective surgeries, visitor restrictions and the clearance of further space for isolating patients.“We can’t explain this case by way of travel history or contact with a person” who is a confirmed case, Dr Holohan said.And despite the surge in cases related to travellers returning from Italy, he said there were no plans to introduce a travel ban for any region.A travel ban would be neither proportionate nor effective in preventing transmission, he said.The patient at CUH is receiving intensive care in an isolation unit there. It is understood the male coronavirus patient received treatment in the hospital last week and was discharged. He was readmitted in recent days and tested for the virus. The National Virus Reference Laboratory confirmed a positive test on Thursday.CUH said it was introducing strict visitor restrictions “with immediate effect” due to infection control concerns.“This is in the interest of patient care and in order to prevent the spread of infections within the hospital.”The hospital said it regretted any inconvenience caused to patients and relatives by “these necessary measures.“All infection control measures are in place and every effort is being made to manage and contain the spread of infection.”Hospital management have advised people to contact their GP or out-of-hours service (SouthDoc) in the first instance and to explore “all other options available to them” before going to the emergency departments in the city if their needs are not urgent.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsProf Martin Cormican, microbiologist and disease expert at NUI Galway and the HSE, answers questions from the public about coronavirus concerns.If someone in my household is a contact and is advised to stay at home, how is it safe for the rest of the family to go about as normal?The person who is a contact may have become infected with the virus. If they are infected with the virus, it has to grow in them for at least some days before it can pass on to you or anyone else in the house.Experience so far shows that the virus does not generally spread from a person who has the infection until the person starts to have some symptoms. So we expect most people who are contacts do not have infection. We also expect any contact who turns out to have infection is most unlikely to spread the virus to you before they get sick. If they do spread the virus to you, you can’t pass it on until it has grown in you for at least some days.Therefore, the risk that you could spread infection is so low that it is reasonable to live your life as normal.Why don’t you just test everybody? The test for the virus involves swabbing the throat and nose. The lab checks for virus genes on the swab. If there are enough virus genes, the test gives a signal (virus detected). If there are not enough virus genes, the test gives no signal (virus not detected).So no signal means there are no virus genes, or there aren’t enough to give a signal. “Virus not detected” is not proof there is no virus.The test works well for finding the virus in a person who has symptoms and who is shedding a lot of virus. If someone gets infected, the virus has to grow in them for some days before the test can detect it. We know the test works well by the time the person gets sick (because there is enough virus).We do not know enough about how well it works before the person gets sick. Testing contacts too early – before they get sick – can give false reassurance.Neither is it the best use of the testing capacity that we have at the National Virus Reference Laboratory.What if someone in the house with a contact is already sick with something else?The steps to reduce the risk of infection are the same for a person who is already sick. If a person with lung or heart disease or a problem with their immune system catches the virus, the infection may be more severe. There is no drug or vaccine that offers additional protection. If it is practical, they could decide to live elsewhere for the 14 days. Public health do not recommend this as necessary but some people do decide to do this if they can.Can contacts in isolation go outside ?Yes. They can go out for a run or a walk outside if they avoid contact with other people. Two people who are contacts in the same household could walk or kick a ball about together, outside in a place away from other people.The important point is to do everything possible to keep contacts 1 metre or more away from anyone who is not in the household and to keep them away from places where virus in their cough or sneeze might settle on something that anyone else will touch soon afterwards.Is there a risk for me if I live in a house with someone who is a contact?Yes, a person living with a contact will become a contact if that person becomes ill, so there is some risk in being in the same house as a contact.The risk can be greatly reduced by keeping distance as much as possible and by ensuring proper hand hygiene as much as possible.Keeping things clean is very important, particularly if the contact is a partner or child.This risk is something you may accept so you can support those you care about. You may not have much choice if you have no other place to live.How can we stop respiratory viruses spreading?Minimise unnecessary contact. Keep your hands to yourself and learn how to clean hands properly.Protect your mucous membranes. Keep your hands away from face, eyes, nose and mouth. Respiratory viruses like influenza and coronavirus have to get on to mucous membranes they can’t get through skin.Keep your distance from sneezes and coughs (more than 1 metre where possible).Use respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette. Use tissues and bin them afterwards, or use the crook of the elbow.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader set to continue his efforts to form a coalition with Fine GaelSeniors could resolve unaffordable mortgages if law \u0026lsquotweaked\u0026rsquo, say debtor advisersCharity for vulnerable adults and children seeks \u0026euro6.5m cash advance to pay salariesBoard meetings continually discussed financial crisis facing healthcare organisationMental Health Commission report finds treatment is effective, says chief executiveJust over one in five DUP supporters believe there will be a united Ireland \u0026lsquoeventually\u0026rsquoHealth service adds beds and looks to plug staffing gaps as Covid-19 spreadsCourt told discussions have been \u0026lsquouseful\u0026rsquoPaula Farrell (47) has pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter of Wayne McQuillan (30)Bodies of couple and their teenage sons found in a house in Reno, NevadaD\u0026aacuteil debates EU humanitarian crisis of migrants along Turkish-Greek borderMosque at Mecca closed for first time in 1,400 years to avoid spreading infectionHarper\u0026rsquos Bazaar editor, Olympian, aviator, Hollywood actress and artist celebratedOpponents to proposals for Limerick plant include JP McManus and Paul O\u0026rsquoConnellVan travelled 1km on segregated path before fatally injuring Raheny resident Nuala GrantContingency plans discussed around public message that panic buying is unnecessaryAdditional seven cases test positive today but numbers \u0026lsquostill small\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash chief medical officerStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4194298.1583431661!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls from within fianna f%C3%A1il for martin to enter talks with sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne Fianna Fáil deputy said Micheál Martin was ‘overestimating’ the tacit support given to him.

Photograph: Alan Betson A meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Thursday heard criticism of his approach to forming a government.It was the first time since the election that many Fianna Fáil TDs voiced criticism of Mr Martin’s approach, with the disquiet spreading beyond those who are usually opposed to the Cork South Central TD.As well as calls for Mr Martin to talk to Sinn Féin – if not actually form a government with it – there was criticism of his repeated attacks on Mary Lou McDonald’s party.Mr Martin was said to be particularly angry about Longford-Westmeath TD Robert Troy criticising his repeated claim that “shadowy” unelected figures run Sinn Féin. Mr Troy claimed Fianna Fáil also had unelected figures making key decisions.One TD present said Mr Martin “flipped” at this point. Others, however, praised Mr Martin.“He showed a bit of fire in the belly,” said one TD.Mr Troy and Dublin South West TD John Lahart, another front bench spokesman, were among those who said Fianna Fáil should not confine itself to talks with just one party. Mr Lahart said Fianna Fáil had only begun to cross bridges and have t more left in this process.They were supported in their calls by TDs John McGuinness and Eamon O’Cúiv, who have previously called for talks with Sinn Féin. In a sign of the robust nature of the meeting, Mr McGuinness was strongly criticised by the normally mild-mannered Sean Haughey.Longford Westmeath’s Joe Flaherty and Laois-Offaly’s Sean Fleming said repeated attacks on Sinn Féin were only giving Ms McDonald publicity. Mr Fleming is understood to have compared it to Tesco giving Dunnes Stores free advertising.Tipperary TD Jackie Cahill called for a full review into Fianna Fáil’s poor election performance, and said that the notion of a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael coalition is not going down well among some members of the public. Limerick TD Willie O’Dea however warned against another election, given Sinn Féin’s popularity.Two weeks ago, at their first meeting after the general election, Fianna Fáil TDs gave Mr Martin a mandate to open talks with other parties except Sinn Féin.Although Mr Martin was said to be “pretty angry”, one senior TD said: “He made it very clear that he was continuing with the mandate given to him.”Meanwhile, Leo Varadkar told the Fine Gael parliamentary party on Thursday night that another election is unlikely.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4194510.1583445016!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord knee bumps all round as tds discuss coronavirus strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKnees up: Fianna Fáil Senator Diarmuid Wilson gets a friendly knee from Labour’s Alan Kelly  on the Plinth on Thursday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The In the middle of a national health crisis no less, a senior politician currently contesting his party’s leadership was clearly observed doing the Hucklebuck on the Leinster House plinth.Alan Kelly, what were you at? The man who hopes to take over from Brendan Howlin as Labour leader was utterly unapologetic.Alan was acting on warnings to avoid handshaking while the coronavirus threat is active. Fist-bump, elbow-rub, foot-shake – there are other ways for politicians to remain hands-on without extending their germ-riddled appendages.He hailed passing Senator Diarmuid Wilson and tried out a few of his new moves. Diarmuid proffered a hand, Alan feinted to the right and then brandished a knee. Very effective.If a little worrying. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, his leadership rival, will have to go one better now. He’ll probably head-butt a nun. The two contenders are shadowing each other everywhere during the campaign in a sickening display of fraternal conviviality.True to form, they sat side-by-side in the Dáil chamber when business temporarily resumed in the absence of a new government to discuss the recent European Council meeting and the continuing threat posed by Covid-19. The party leaders said their bit during the Order of Business.Speakers included Brendan Howlin, outgoing Labour leader. As contributions drew to a close, one of the men who wants his job chanced his arm and tried to speak. He caught the Ceann Comhairle’s eye.“Deputy Alan Kelly, you’re offering. Sorry, I can’t take you because this is only for party leaders and you’re not at this time leader of the Labour Party.” Aodhán snapped to attention. “Same applies to you, deputy Ó Ríordáin” added Seán Ó Fearghaíl. When it was announced that the Dáil would take the time it was not using to elect a new Taoiseach to discuss the virus, a grateful nation heaved a sigh of relief. Salvation was at hand.Not only was it the only subject on the Order of Business, but more than 2½ hours were set aside later in the evening for statements on the issue. It was a long slog.By two hours in and the maiden speech of Verona Murphy, the urge to self-isolate had gone far beyond the realm of the virus. The independent TD from Wexford completely ignored the designated topic and spoke about her election, the economy and the state of the building industry.Twice, the Ceann Comhairle had to ask her to finish as she was over her allotted time. At the tail end of her irrelevant speech, Verona threw in a couple of throwaway lines on the virus and sat down.On the plus side, after a day of talking, we can be confident that our politicians are virus-ready. At this worrying time in Leinster House, Independent TD Catherine Connolly spoke for almost everyone.“I welcome the fact we are not forming another committee.” It’s bad enough living under the threat of a viral pandemic without a special Dáil talking-shop blundering in and making things worse. The vast majority of TDs agreed. Brendan Howlin was the exception.In his book, there is nothing which cannot be considerably enhanced by the addition of an all-party Oireachtas committee. “I am strongly of the view that this is necessary,” he declared, particularly because we are in “the unusual situation of an interregnum”.What will happen if significant policy decisions have to be made? Who will provide “political underpinning of the legitimacy” of these decisions? He was referring to Leo Varadkar’s caretaker Government, which is neither here nor there in the context of the general election result but is still, crucially, in power.Words are very important in these anxious days when people are feeling personally vulnerable and very apprehensive about the future.The acting Taoiseach, who is a medical doctor, explained what we really need to know. “It is worth reminding the House that under the Constitution the Government continues until a new one is elected. The terms ‘caretaker’ or ‘acting’ are not used.” The very thought of it.He is a Trinity graduate. You won’t see Leo Varadkar in a brown shopcoat, toting a sweeping brush. How dare they.Until whenever, Leo stressed he remains in charge. But he’s not the boss of Mary Lou McDonald or Micheál Martin anymore.The Sinn Féin leader made it clear that the other main parties must not “be left as an afterthought” when decisions about the coronavirus strategy are considered.The Taoiseach (he’s no caretaker) readily agreed with Mary Lou. “I am happy to give exactly that assurance.”The Fianna Fáil leader was in favour of some sort of committee, but is happy with “a mechanism” allowing public representatives, for example, to have access to information which will help them answer questions from the public.“The psychology of a public health scare is at times as important as the scare itself” Micheál said. His TDs have discovered that when the virus is connected with their locality, “basically the phone explodes.”Social Democrat Róisín Shorthall provided some helpful information. The Business Committee met earlier on this committee business and decided it was not a good idea to establish a new one to monitor the situation. There is no point in dragging senior public health officials into Kildare Street to answer questions when they are needed at the coalface.Briefing sessions should suffice. If emergency legislation is needed, she has “no doubt that all members will make themselves available to return here at short notice”.Catherine Connolly wanted to talk about context. Primary care facilities are being closed at an “unprecedented” rate in the west of Ireland, said the Galway-based TD. “We have a current crisis. There are major closures planned in primary care and we are talking about capacity in relation to this virus. We really want to get real and put it in perspective. There is a crisis as is.”This time, though, the chequebook is coming out. The Taoiseach said money over and above the HSE’s budget for this year will be available to fund whatever actions are needed to fight the virus. Closed intensive care units are to be opened up and extra beds will be made available. Because you see, people are dying all the time but this is different.“The HSE has been given the green light to use additional resources, staff and financial, as needed, so that we are able to contain Covid-19 for as long as we can.”Richard Boyd Barrett had a helpful suggestion. As this is a crisis, there should be no “two-tier system” in operation. Pass legislation if needs be, but open up the private beds too if the situation deteriorates, he urged the Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader.Foot-shakes and knee-bumps all round if that ever happens.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193895.1583438545!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu and britain say deal looks difficult after first round of talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier: “An agreement is possible, even if difficult,” he said in Brussels. Photograph: Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesIt will be tough to reach a deal between the European Union and Britain to govern their post-Brexit relationship but it can be done, negotiators said after the first round of talks concluded on Thursday.“To be completely frank with you there are many ergences ... and they are very serious ergences,” said the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. “I think, sincerely, that the agreement is possible, even if difficult.” A UK official close to the talks said the sides were far apart on issues of fishing rights, on what governance system could resolve disputes, and on the so-called level playing field. “Basically it’s going to be tough but it’s just the first round. Overall it was constructive,” said the UK official. “Our vision is of a trade relationship between sovereign equals.”Mr Barnier stressed that irrespective of whether a deal was reached, Britain’s decision to leave the single market and customs union meant that big changes lay ahead for trade on January 1st, 2021. All goods imported or exported between the EU and Britain would be subject to customs formalities, UK financial firms would lose their passporting rights to sell across the EU, and UK certification of goods would no longer be valid in the bloc.“It will not be business as usual ... it will be very very different,” Mr Barnier said. “The difficulties that will be linked to that, my impression is that they are still very often underestimated.”Britain hopes to achieve a free-trade deal with the European Union that allows it to export easily into the world’s largest economic bloc.The EU says free access to its single market can only be granted if the UK aligns with EU norms, in order to avoid giving its companies an unfair competitive advantage, something Britain has rejected since agreeing to it in principle last year. Prime minister Boris Johnson’s government now argues that erging from EU norms, or at least the freedom to do so, is the entire point of Brexit. This rules out the close trade relationship pursued by his predecessor Theresa May. Customs checksMr Johnson secured Britain’s leeway to sharply erge from EU norms in the withdrawal agreement of last year, which guaranteed Northern Ireland would remain in line with the EU as a default, in order to avoid a land border.This entails that checks and customs formalities will take place between Northern Ireland and Britain.The EU has made the future relationship agreement contingent on the implementation of that deal, and chief UK negotiator David Frost has assured Brussels that Britain will uphold its commitments.The practicalities of what this means for trade between Northern Ireland and Britain is to be studied by a joint EU-UK committee, which will meet for the first time on March 30th.Businesses in the North, which are strongly reliant on easy trade both across the sea with Britain and with the Republic, have appealed for clarity on what the arrangements will be.“Business likes certainty and at the moment we don’t have that,” said Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium. “It needs to be something that’s deliverable in the nine months we have available.”Britain is in a transitional arrangement until December 31st, continuing to follow prior norms. There will be four more rounds of negotiations in Brussels and London before May. UK negotiators say if they judge insufficient progress has been made by June, they will abandon talks to prepare for a no deal scenario. In that case, World Trade Organisation default tarriffs would apply to imports and exports between the EU and UK from January 1st, delivering an even greater jolt to trade than if a deal is reached.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Critics of the BBC say it has an Auntie knows best attitude when delivering news on subjects such as politics and climate change.But Lord Hall said the corporation was retreating from that position. What I hope we are developing is a much warmer relationship with the British public which is less the \u0027Auntie\u0027 of two or three decades ago and more something interwoven into the fabric of our lives, he said.He also appeared to accept the charge laid by Oliver Dowden, the new Culture Secretary, that the BBC lacks ersity of thought and has failed to represent different views in its news coverage.Speaking to Deloitte\u0027s Media and Telecoms conference in London, Lord Hall said: We should be open to people criticising what we do. I think the Secretary of State said something interesting, which I have believed for some time, and that is about ersity of thought.In news, teams matter, and the ersity of teams matters. Having people who are going to argue with you, come from a different perspective, a different view – it really matters to have people who don\u0027t think like you and bring a different perspective in the judgments you make about news, about programmes and about content in general.Lord Hall said he believed the licence fee would exist in some form after the current charter period ends in 2027, despite the government\u0027s determination to explore the possibility of a subscription model. But he added that the BBC may be able to boost the mixed funding model by making larger contributions from its commercial arm, BBC Studios.Lord Hall signalled that more money will be injected into BBC Three, the youth channel that was relegated to online-only in 2016 and subsequently saw its ratings plummet. Ofcom has warned the corporation that it may not be sustainable in its current form unless it regains younger audiences.In a House of Lords debate on Wednesday, Lord Bragg, the Labour peer and presenter of Radio 4’s In Our Time, said a Netflix-style subscription service would be the model from hell for public service broadcasting.The BBC licence fee should be examined, but the best way is not to dismantle it but to reform it, Lord Bragg added. The declared policy of sending a wrecking ball through an organisation that has taken almost 100 years to evolve and is now fine-tuned to every class, age group, creed and niche in this country is childish.But Lord Lilley, the Tory peer who served as a Cabinet minister under Baroness Thatcher and John Major, said BBC bias had reached unacceptable levels.He said: People in the BBC have certain \u0027group think\u0027 on some key issues, notably immigration, climate change and Europe. So instead of informing on these issues, it censors, instead of educating, it seeks to indoctrinate, and instead of entertaining, it seeks to preach.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/02/TELEMMGLPICT000226696181_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"can britain tackle overlapping negotiations eu us","story":"David Frost, Britain\u0026#39s chief Brexit negotiator, and his European Commission counterpart, Michel Barnier at the start of talks this weekAs the UK-US deal advances, the pressure will build on the EU and its fishermen, farmers and manufacturers to relax some of their demands in order to make a deal deliverableThe overlapping timelines of Britain\u0027s negotiations with the EU, and, separately, with the United States, create an interesting set of power dynamics for David Frost, Crawford Falconer and our negotiating teams in Downing Street and the Department for International Trade to navigate. The two scenarios are very different. In the US case, the political will for a deal is high on both sides. Both President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been vocal about their desire to conclude a free trade agreement (FTA). In the case of the EU, however, while both sides would like a deal, the UK has made it clear (watch the video below) it will not trade sovereignty for European supremacy over its legal order. Members of the US Congress have now publicly called for a UK-US deal before the UK-EU pact is made, so as to ensure the UK does not fall back into the clutches of the EU on regulatory issues.The US, moreover, sees this deal as a major part of its global ambitions. There is a developing Trump doctrine on trade that essentially assumes a trade deficit equates to a structural problem with the exporting country\u0027s economy. For example, Mr Trump thinks the massive trade deficits that the US runs with China and the EU are the result of distortions in those markets, giving their companies unfair advantages over US ones. The UK is interesting to the US because (by a statistical quirk), both countries seem to think they have a surplus with each other. Therefore, Mr Trump sees a UK deal in very different terms. He wants deals with China, Japan and others because he wants to correct those perceived structural issues. He has proven he is willing to use tariffs to bring recalcitrant partners to heel. This will be the dynamic of any US-EU negotiation. By contrast, the UK deal will be regarded as an opportunity to set the table for the global economic environment. Hence, expect the US to extend the disciplines of the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (formerly the North American Trade Agreement) on state subsidies, market distortions and the like to the UK-US FTA, even though neither country really presents the systemic distortion problem that China does. By contrast, the EU-UK deal is seen in the EU at best as a necessary evil, the fruit of the poison tree of Brexit. It does not seek opportunities, only the containment of damage - and, it hopes, a future say over Britain\u0027s regulations and tariffs. The UK has also been more than ambivalent on its need for a further agreement, post Brexit. Once the UK made it clear it would not be in the single market and customs union, or align regulations, businesses knew they had to prepare for customs and regulatory checks of some type. The business focus has shifted on to the scale of those checks, and this has pushed mutual recognition and systems of adequacy and equivalence up the agenda. The UK will not want to do anything with the EU that curbs its global ambitions.Third, the US, rightly or wrongly, believes the UK position is that outlined by Mr Johnson in his Greenwich speech (watch the video below) or by David Frost in his Brussels speech - namely, a nation that will prioritise an independent trade policy, and look to champion free trade in the post-Brexit world.On Tuesday, the UK trade secretary Liz Truss made Britain\u0027s first intervention in the World Trade Organization (WTO) as an independent member for 50 years. Taking her at her word, WTO members are entitled to believe that the UK will be a force for freer trade, liberalisation, property rights protection and competitive markets. The UK will act as a catalyst (as the Prime Minister put it) to solve global trading problems such as unfair trade practices, intellectual property violations and market distortions, as Ms Truss specifically mentioned. This means that a UK-US FTA is likely to be a high-ambition agreement.Of course, the UK-EU FTA is very important to both economies, but as the UK-US deal advances (I suspect quickly) alongside other deals with countries like Australia, New Zealand and Japan, and as the UK signals a more pro-competitive regulatory regime of its own, the pressure will build on the EU and its fishermen, farmers and manufacturers to relax some of their demands in order to make a deal deliverable. Ultimately, EU negotiators must realise a failure to shift from its level playing field position, and absurd demands for the UK\u0027s legal order to be under EU supervision, will mean foregoing the opportunity for a mutually beneficial deal. As a result, supply chains will move and will not reorient back to the UK-EU27. This reality will be Britain\u0027s trump card in the tricky negotiations ahead. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They are also the most likely breed to bite themselves when stressed, with 11 per cent of them reported as doing so.10.6 per cent of Miniature Schnauzers were aggressive towards strangers, compared to 0.4 per cent of Labrador Retrievers, and 23 per cent of German Shepherds were found to have compulsive behaviour.Fear was most common in Spanish Water Dogs, Shetland Sheepdogs and mixed breeds. In contrast, Labrador Retrievers were very rarely fearful. Fear of surfaces and heights was the most often observed in Rough Collie and mixed breed dogs, and hyperactivity and impulsivity were the most common in mixed breed dogs, German Shepherds, Spanish Water Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and the least common in Rough Collies and Miniature Schnauzers.The scientists, led by Dr Hannes Lohi have recommended that efforts be made in the environment the pets live in to reduce their stress.Male and female dogs were reported by their owners to have differing traits.The study says: Male and female dogs displayed diferences in the prevalence of behaviour problems. Male dogs had a higher prevalence of aggressiveness, separation related behaviour, inattention and hyperactivityimpulsivity. In contrast, female dogs had a higher prevalence of fearfulness.Noise sensitivity, fear of surfaces and compulsive behaviour occurred independent of sex.Age also plays a part in different anxieties. Noise sensitivity, and especially fear of thunder, increased with age, as did fear of heights and surfaces, such as walking on metal grids or shiny floors.Younger dogs more often damaged or urinated on items when left alone, and were also more often inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive and chased their tails more than older dogs. The authors added: Our fndings on breed diferences indicate that canine anxieties likely have a genetic basis.Therefore, it could be possible to decrease the prevalence of canine anxieties by selecting non-anxious animals for breeding.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/20/17/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner.jpg","title":"ben affleck jennifer garner way back rehab alcoholism","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor ‘fell of the wagon’ just before shooting was scheduled to beginThe director of The Way Back has revealed that Jennifer Garner called him up to persuade him to continue making the film, after her ex-husband and its lead star Ben Affleck was admitted to rehab.During promotional interviews for the film, Affleck has opened up a lot about his struggles with alcoholism and his relapse in 2018.The actor went to rehab shortly before the film, which follows a former basketball all-star struggling with addiction, was due to begin shooting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“So, what happened was, just as we started prepping the movie, Ben fell off the wagon,” Gavin O’Connor told student publication 34th Street Magazine.“So he ended up going to rehab, and I didn’t know if the movie was over.

And then he got out the day before we started shooting.

It is already concerned about tariffs and the effect of a highly uncertain future. “Brexit is affecting both the reality of our business and our customers’ confidence,” says Pow, who is concerned the company will be less competitive in future with rivals based inside the EU.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The same cannot be said for many British companies who may need to call on emergency funding to ride any turbulence caused by the outbreak.The Bank of England’s governor, Andrew Bailey\u0026nbsp(who starts the job in 10\u0026nbspdays), told MPs this week he may take action imminently to support lending to struggling small businesses. That might include relaxing banks’ capital requirements to allow them to hand out more loans – but there’s no guarantee that the banks will actually do it.Live: EU reveals ‘very difficult differences’ with UK over BrexitBoris Johnson spokesman insists coronavirus will not delay BrexitCoronavirus and no-deal Brexit: Spot the differenceBoost from US trade deal could be as small as 0.02 per cent of GDPFor some British firms, the impact is already being felt.Tudor Rose International, a Gloucestershire-based logistics company, exports well-known food and drinks brands around the world.\u0026nbspIt is close to the sharp end of the outbreak. Costs have shot up around 15 per cent so far as the company struggles to find enough ships to transport its products, says commercial manager\u0026nbspJohn Stephenson.\u0026nbspTudor Rose is losing sales as ships stay stuck in Chinese ports, causing a major backlog in the key arteries of world trade.\u0026nbspWith many Chinese factories shut down to contain the virus’s spread, there is much less to ship and so freight companies have cancelled sailings. That leaves British firms facing a shortage of containers to put their goods into, pushing up prices.“It has an effect all along those routes via places like Mumbai and the Middle East,” says\u0026nbspStephenson.Shipping is often seen as a canary in the coal mine for economic shocks to come. With a vessel taking about a month to make its way from China to Europe, the sharp drop in activity in China is still working its way through.Stephenson estimates that there are about 100 fewer vessels on the global routes along which Tudor Rose ships its food and drink. That may not sound like a lot but each one is vast, carrying an average 20,000 containers.Two million fewer containers has a real impact, says Stephenson. “It’s already been quite pronounced. We’ve had a customer already waiting for a large order that we haven’t been able to fill.”Created with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaThe effect coronavirus is having on shipping is unprecedented, he says. “We do see some seasonality of demand but we’ve not seen an event like this that’s had this much impact.”Tudor Rose has been looking to boost sales in North America where disruption has been less severe than Asia but there is a limit to this strategy.“We sell fast-moving consumer goods so we need a consistent, regular supply to our customers,” says Stephenson. The company anticipates some rebound in demand when the outbreak calms down but for the most part, sales lost now are likely to be lost for good.If Chinese ports open up fully again things will improve, but Tudor Rose fears there may be further shutdowns at other key points along the route as governments seek to contain the virus.“We are at the early stages of this. It’s only in the last 10\u0026nbspdays that it’s come to light how significant this could be,”\u0026nbspsays StephensonBack in Glasgow, Donald Pow is remaining vigilant but relatively relaxed, given the situation. “We don’t know what’s going to happen many of the experts don’t seem to know what’s going to happen.”“It’s like that old football manager cliche: we just take each game as it comes.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We also ask the UK to respect our own independence,” Mr Barnier said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Of course, we respect the UK’s sovereignty, and just as the UK sets its own conditions for opening up its market, the EU sets its own conditions for opening up its markets for goods and services.\u0026nbspThe real question is not about our reciprocal independence: the real question is what we do with our respective independence.\u0026nbsp“Our common challenge now is as two independent entities to agree together on ground rules that makes it possible for us to cooperate, to trade\u0026nbspand to travel.”Brexit talks kick off without handshake to avoid spreading coronavirusGiving a review of the first week’s talks, the chief negotiator said the UK was refusing to sign a commitment to stay in the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as rejecting\u0026nbspan agreement tying it to “high standards” for labour,\u0026nbspenvironmental, and state aid\u0026nbspregulations.“The United Kingdom informs us that they do not wish to commit formally to applying the European Convention on Human Rights,” Mr Barnier said.\u0026nbspOn the “level playing field” for regulations, Mr Barnier said the UK said it wanted to maintain high standards, but would not legally commit to them.“Whilst we agree on preserving high standards, my question is why not commit to them formally? It’s a question of trust,” he said.Both sides in negotiations are\u0026nbspkeenly aware that talks, which involve between 200 and 300 officials, could be hit by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Areas like trade in goods, services, transport, energy, access to EU programmes – areas where there’s a well understood, well precedented framework.

Since those stars have been used to track the history of the universe as it expands, our measurement of fundamental processes such as the Hubble constant and the amount of dark matter\u0026nbspcould be wrong\u0026nbsptoo, scientists have said.The new findings come from a team of astronomers led by Maria Bergemann\u0026nbspfrom the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy. They measured the chemical make-up of stars and came upon unexpected results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAstronomers had previously believed that a specific kind of supernova – known as “type Ia” – usually came about when a white dwarf orbited around a normal star and pulled away its outer layers. However, new measurements show that they largely come from other scenarios.That, in turn, suggests that we may be wrong in our understanding of how bright such stars can be, how the brightness changes over time, and how long they can stay bright. In the other kinds of explosions, the brightness is not as neatly constrained, and so we cannot know as definitively how bright a star should appear.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It has underwritten work that helped suggest that our universe is made up of about 70 per cent dark energy, and the measurement of the Hubble constant, or the speed at which our universe is expanding.In some ways, the new measurements might prove useful to scientists. It could help explain the apparent discrepancy in the Hubble constant, which has arisen as scientists have found that different measurements – some using type Ia supernovae and others looking at the universe through the cosmic microwave background – do not match up.Further work is expected to help check the new findings against observations of other parts of the universe. One important test could be the third data release from the European Space Agency’s Gaia programme, which will come next year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within an hour, I was heading up Interstate 5 to Everett, to talk to health officials and get reactions from residents. (Summation of interviews: Not concerned. Trying to stay calm.)Six weeks later, the nation’s first fatality was reported in the suburb of Kirkland. This time it was a dash northwest on Interstate 405 to talk to people stocking in a supermarket close to the hospital where the person had died and where the LifeCare Centre nursing home was located. (Summation of interviews: Increasingly concerned. Trying to calm, but anxious.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow the death toll has reached 11. More than 100,000 employees of companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, among them my wife, have been told to work from home to reduce the spread of the virus. \u0026nbspResidents over the age of 60, or people with underlying health conditions, have also been advised to stay at home. Officials have ordered school districts to close. They have also suggested community groups cancel events involving more than ten people.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Airports empty as Coronavirus affects aviation industry Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China711 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China1011 Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, ChinaImages from stores such a Costco show massive lines. Companies such as Amazon report a spike in orders of canned goods and hand sanitiser. Mike Pence is visiting the state capital.And yet people in the neighhourhood coffee shop this morning appeared to display little concern. One customer, Lindsay Berger, who was chatting to two other women, said she was stunned by how people were “overreacting”.“It makes me worry what we’d do if there was a real crisis,” she said. She said friends in New York had sent her images of the Union Square branch of Whole Foods Market with the shelves bare.\u0026nbsp“This is contagious, but mild. What if it was something that was contagious but acute?”With most crises or declared states of emergency, be it the Fukishima earthquake of 2011, or Typhoon Haiyan that tore through the Philippines in 2013, the challenge for reporters is largely one of logistics.\u0026nbspCan you get to the place, can you find a translator. Is there a cell signal, or can you borrow someone’s satellite phone.\u0026nbspA friend who covered the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 donned hazmat gear for four straight months, as he documented the diseases devastating spread, something for which he received a Pulitzer Prize.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It feels an exercise in indulgence and privilege to report people’s concerns about whether to take a flight on their vacation. It hardly feels like a crisis if people can click a button to restock their food cupboard.\u0026nbspAs with so much of today’s world, privilege will likely emerge as a defining faultline as the coronavirus crisis plays out.If you have health insurance you know you can be treated if you fall ill. If you have a place to live, you can work from home, assuming you have a job. Unless, that is, you work in one of the warehouses filled with canned food, or are a delivery driver, or work in a coffee shop or fast-food restaurant.But what about the estimated 5,0000 of Seattle’s homeless, their plight worsened by the shortage in affordable housing those thousands of well-rewarded tech employees\u0026nbsphave helped to create?How do you get treatment for coronavirus if your home is a tent under the interstate, or next to a new construction? Will you end up in the 84-room EconoLodge motel that officials at King County has bought for $4m in the town of Renton to be used as a a quarantine facility for coronavirus patients.Or will they put you in an alternative isolation unit in a trailer\u0026nbspon public parking lots.“Many of us can shelter in place, we can go home, we can even work remotely,” said King County Executive Dow Constantine. “That is not an option for people who are unhoused.”Authorities launch probe of care home at centre of coronavirus crisisConfused about Trump’s response to coronavirus? You should beNot enough coronavirus tests to meet US demand, Pence admitsThis morning, many people in the area were jolted by a story in the New York Times that suggested in the six weeks between the first outbreak was reported\u0026nbspin Everett\u0026nbspto the first death, in Kirkland,\u0026nbspanywhere between from 150 to 1,500 people may have had, or contracted the disease.Mike Famulare, a principal research scientist at the Institute for Disease Modelling in Bellevue, said it was most likely 300 to 500.\u0026nbspThe most genuinely frightening thing is that people do not know where the virus is or who has been infected. Is it that person sneezing on the bus? What about that person walking their dogs?For reporters, the challenge is identifying the locus. What is the essence of the story we’re trying to cover?As health officials step up their testing, many cases will be reported. We are almost certainly likely to see more deaths. At some point, those numbers will start to reduce, but that may be some time away.A heartening comment came from a member of staff in that coffee shop this morning when I expressed some surprise to find it open. She said it had been “business as usual” but that “everybody is making an effort to be super friendly”.Was that the employees or the customers, I asked.

His entry was selected as the winner.\u0026nbsp“We as humans evolved as creatures who could learn to adapt to any situation, no matter how harsh,” Alexander wrote in his entry essay. “We will meet many setbacks on the way to Mars.

The organisation launched the contest in August 2019 and received more than 28,000 essays. Those essays were winnowed down to nine finalists, and a public poll was conducted, which NASA officials considered during when deciding on the winner.

With 415 pledged delegates, California is by far the biggest prize of Super Tuesday, and Mr Sanders had been banking on a significant win there.With millions of ballots left to count, it is impossible to know how the delegates will be allocated, and it may not be clear for several days or even weeks. Roughly two-thirds of California delegates are distributed based on congressional districts, with candidates needing at least 15 per cent of the vote to win any delegates.But with Sanders receiving more than 70 per cent of Latino voters under the age of 30, and about half of Latino voters overall, according to exit polls, his lead over the other candidates looked decisive.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Associated Press projected Mr Sanders as the winner of the state just minutes after the polls closed, while thousands of voters in Los Angeles County were still in line to cast their ballots because of problems with voting machines.A new $300m\u0026nbsp(£232m) voting system caused waits as long as four hours at dozens of polling sites throughout Los Angeles County, including in Westwood, the San Fernando Valley, Los Feliz and the east side of Los Angeles. The sign-in process to check voters against the voting rolls took hours at several sites, and internet issues left many centres with a small fraction of working machines. Lines continued past 10pm\u0026nbspat many locations, including several college campuses.Created with Sketch. Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.More than four million mail-in ballots had been sent in by Tuesday morning, and as many as five million ballots were left to count by Wednesday, according to an analysis from Political Data Inc, a California-research group that closely tracks returns.Along with Mr Sanders, both former vice-president Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, seemed likely to receive delegates in the state, based on early returns. Bloomberg had poured $66m\u0026nbsp(£51m)\u0026nbspinto television advertising here, far more than any other candidate.State officials moved up the state’s primary to March this year in an attempt to make California more politically influential when it comes to choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. The change meant that voters saw far more television advertisements: roughly $120m\u0026nbsp(£93)\u0026nbspworth, with the majority coming from Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg.Several candidates visited parts of the state that have long been ignored in statewide elections, including Bakersfield and Riverside. Still, California never drew the candidates of early-voting states like Iowa or New Hampshire, and most of the candidates relied on national news coverage to gain recognition in the state.There was a clear generational split in the state, with Mr Sanders winning among voters under 49. Mr Biden won among older voters, black voters and moderates in California, the same coalition that helped him win several other states on Tuesday.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Vellanowth came to Los Angeles from Mexico as a baby, and her daughter went on to graduate from UCLA and then attend graduate school at the University of Southern California.But all that success came with a big caveat: her daughter, who works in public administration for the city of Anaheim, is struggling under the weight of almost a half-million dollars in student loans.Who are the animal rights activists who interrupted Biden’s speech?How Bernie Sanders can turn around his Super Tuesday disaster“Bigger than my mortgage,” said Ms Vellanowth, 43, who works in health care. She said her daughter is getting married this month, and she worries about how her daughter and husband will ever be able to afford to have children or buy a home.That reason alone was enough to draw her, and many of her family members and friends in the Latino community in Los Angeles to Sanders, attracted, she said, by his message of fighting the type of inequality they feel every day.In California, which has the fifth-largest economy in the world but is also home to the highest poverty rate in the nation when housing costs are factored in, wealth inequality has been a paramount political issue driving voters to the polls.With such a wealth chasm as a backdrop, Mr Sanders’ platform of “Medicare for All”, free college tuition and student loan relief has resonated deeply. He has also promised to protect so-called dreamers – immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children – and roll back the Trump administration’s executive orders on immigration.It’s not only California’s poor and working class who have supported Sanders some who may not struggle financially have been moved by the stark inequality they see every day.“He’s the one who seems like he’s most likely to improve the quality of life for the average person,” said Michael Lussier, 29, who works in real estate.Mr Lussier lives in downtown Los Angeles, which has been engulfed by a worsening homeless crisis. “Living so close to all that makes it harder to vote for anyone who will perpetuate the status quo,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

This update will mean that those attacks do not need to be targeted at an inidual or specic group.Twitters head of safety policy, Jerrel Peterson said: #If its a tweet that doesnt have an @mention that likens a group based on their age, disability or disease to viruses or microbes or maggots, something thats less than human, that can be in violation of our policy now.#Any offending tweets must be removed.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other. We all want to be healthy and so much of that starts from being clean.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sue, pictured with Harry, says she didn’t realise he was overweight until his hip collapsed. And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world. Very grateful, thank you. My le is enriched.It seems that Stace is getting tired of “trolls” telling her she’s not bringing up her kids right. Not dressing them in appropriate clothing and stuff.Can’t say I give a monkey’s one way or the other. But I’m not absolutely certain that the best way to convince people you’re an elegant and well-mannered young lady is to take a selfie while you’re laying a cable, you know And then there’s this. She’s annoyed with the trolls right now.

They have now been liberated. So what are they going to feed the snakes Kale and mung bean risotto  I’m telling you, they won’t like that. The likely answer is mice.So why is that any better than feeding them their cousins, hamsters A spokesmouse for the British Association of Small Rodentstold me yesterday: “It’s ludicrous. Totally inconsistent.Hamsters get away with murder. Because they’ve got chubby little cheeks and are refugees from Syria.“But nobody cares about us mice. And at least we don’t spend half the bloody night running around on a wheel like a moron. Can’t stand hamsters, me.”Anyway, Bob’s half the size of Mount Everest and rushing towards us at nearly ,mph.

But the Queen is nothingnot practical.She has learned the lessons of the unedying exits of Princess Diana and the Duchess of York from The Firm and won’t make the same mistake this time.That’s why she quite beautully told Harry:  “You are much loved and will always be welcomed back” — a line that brings tears to the eyes of a  soppy old monarchist like me.The Queen has not accepted that Megxit is permanent and probably never will. Harry needs some time away to explore and live a le where he isn’t playing second fiddle to his father — with whom relations remain strained — and brother.Duty and the love of his country might just pull him back soon, she hopes.But perhaps the Queen hasn’t factored in the persuasiveness and passion of Meghan — a truly modern woman with very dferent plans for her husband and their “brand”.SOMETHING Kinda Woohoo as Girls Aloud fans like me got fresh hope this week.One of the main obstacles preventing the chart-topping band reuniting has been the feud between the lovely Nadine Coyle and some of the other members.But Kimberley Walsh met Nadine this week and they seemed to be getting along just fine. Of course, the real battle will be getting Cheryl Tweedy on board.Although with her last single peaking at No, I think she might be willing to kiss and make up with Nads too. As the Pussycat Dolls have proven, there’s nothing like an enormous cheque to help smooth over bitter relations.After all, a high-profile pregnancy and cute baby being born at No always lts our collective spirits, right Similar sentiments were expressed when Tony Blair and David Cameron said  their wives were expecting while PM.  The pregnancies of Kate and Meghan were widely celebrated, too.But we are  gripped by a nasty culture war driven by social media.So after the happy announcement, Twitter once again became a hateful cesspit where apparently respectable professionals found despicable ways to slag off a young woman expecting her first baby, to a man she loves, and spout pathetic conspiracy theories.Ironically, many  were  the same crew who have been banging on for  weeks about the need to be kind to those in the public eye.But those rules instituted by the London liberal keyboard warriors only applyyou have the same political views as they do.If you are a Tory or a Brexiteer, or on the right or work for a popular newspaper, you are such an abhorrent human being in the eyes of the likes of Alastair Campbell and Jameela Jamil that you can be torn to shreds without a hint of irony from the perpetrators who are no better than abusive trolls.THE idea that over-weight people need reminding that they’re the  F-wordis nonsensical.If you have been obese and still battle the bulge every day, you’ll know that being the F-word is inside your head every minute.That’s why I embrace the idea put forward in the Pledge To Eradicate Weight Stigma, by Professor Francesco Rubino, from King’s College London, that describing people as fat, overweight and obese is just as debilitating as a racial slur in .Skinny folk convincing themselves that overweight people are McDonald’s-obsessed lazy slobs is offensive and wrong.And that type of outdated approach will do nothing to solve our obesity epidemic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We go home and think, ‘Shall we see what’s on Netflix, or Amazon, or BBC iPlayer or ITVplayer.“We have to ask ourselves, how do we retain the value of public service broadcasting “Unique programmes, the independent news output, while at the same time adapting to changing times.”During the interview, Oliver – David Cameron’s former deputy chief of staff – also hinted that the BBC could be forced to compete for funding in the future against ITV, who does have a smaller public service remit.When askedthey could take money from the licence fee, he said: “There is already an element of that happening.“The overall framework of the licence fee is set out in the Royal Charter until  but of course we need to be asking ourselves these questions“It’s not just the BBC that does Public Service Broadcasting. If you look at Channel  and ITV, they don’t operate on a completely commercial model.“They do things that have a wider public service benefit.”During his speech at the Enders Media and Telecoms Conference in London, Oliver attacked the BBC for its “narrow view” and said at times it was “too urban” in its thinking – rather than showing “genuine ersity”.Speaking on talkRADIO, he also accused the BBC and politicians of misreading the public mood on major issues, including Brexit.He said: “It’s not just the BBC it’s other media outlets and the politicians who were caught off guard by Brexit, caught off guard by Trump, because they didn’t quite understand what people up and down the country were thinking.“I remember during the Brexit campaign and talking to my mum who works in the local boots.“And she said to me, ‘I’m telling you, everyone is going to be voting for Brexit because everyone who comes into this shop is talking about it.’“It’s exactly that kind of the connection that the BBC needs to make sure it maintains.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is the second time a little-known change to peopleaposs surplus earnings has been delayed, as ministers try to figure out how to make it work. At the moment, the Department for Work and Pensionsmostly turns a blind eye to claimants who earning wildly fluctuating amounts from one month to the next. From April , new rules were due to restrict the amount of Universal Credit these people could claim. But those new rules were postponed to April  after the governmentaposs social security watchdog raised serious doubts they would work.Today, DWP ministers announced the rules have been postponed for another year to April  - saving claimants from £million in cuts. Around , fewer people will see their Universal Credit award reduced, minister Will Quince said. This will safeguard the efficient administration of Universal Credit. What is this about  The obscure rule change was due to hit a large group of people on Universal Credit , the six-benefits-in-one payment that is being rolled out across the country.Lots of people who claim Universal Credit have a job, but their salary is low enough to be on benefits.However,youaposre self-employed, part time, zero-hour or a aposgig economyapos worker, your earnings change from one month to the next.So in a good month, you might earn too much to claim Universal Credit. But then in the next month you earn less and you have to go back on Universal Credit. This creates a massive headache for Jobcentre chiefs, who have to work out how to treat you and how much in benefits you should get. Whataposs the rule change  In a bid to make things fairer, the government wants to change how it deals with surplus earnings - the excess money in months where you earn too much to get UC. The surplus earnings rule means when you reapply for UC, you have any surplus earnings youaposve racked up in the previous  months taken into account.So - say you have a bumper month in May and earn £, over the threshold to claim UC.

Without action the number of kids in poverty in the UK is set to rise from .million to .million in the next two years. Our Give Me Five campaign wants an immediate increase in child benefit - a move which would lt , children out of destitution. We also want the Government to restore child tax credits, to scrap the two-child limit and to axe the benefit cap. Our campaign - launched ahead of next week’s Budget - is backed by charities, including End Child Poverty, politicians and union leaders. Punitive welfare policies, low wages and soaring housing costs have pushed more and more families below the breadline. Are you a parent struggling with poverty  Email webnews@mirror Since the Tories came to power in  child poverty has soared by more than half a million from . million to . million. Shocking statistics show seven in ten childrenin poverty are in working households. And two out of three children of single parents are in poverty. These figures are set to rise because of the government’s benefit policies. The two child limit - which limits benefits to the first two children, no matter how many there are in the family - has pushed , children in , families into poverty since it was introduced in .

The Child Poverty Action Group says increasing child benefit, axing the two-child limit, restoring tax credits and scrapping the benefit cap would lt , children out of poverty at a cost of £.billion - less than a tenth of the price of the £billion HS bill. Child benefit is worth £. a week for the eldest child and £. for other children.

To sign our petition calling on Boris Johnson to increase child benefit click here  A £ a week increase would see families gain £ a year on average and immediately lt , children out of poverty. It would cost the Treasury £.billion. Pressure has intensied on Mr Johnson to act after the Scottish Government said it was introducing a £ child benefit supplement for the poorest families from next year. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said more children are in poverty today than  years ago.  He says on “current trends . million children in the UK – one in every three – will be consigned to poverty by , more than at any time in the Thatcher-Major years.” Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group said: “We’re a country that wants every child to thrive. But child poverty is rising – not falling. “That should ring alarm bells for every politician because it will damage children’s well- being, their chances in le and the country’s economy. “The Mirror is bang on when it says we must reinvest in child benefit. An extra five pounds a week per child would make a big dference to the families who are struggling most.”  TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “No child in Britain should be growing up in poverty. But millions of parents are struggling to feed and clothe their kids. That is not right. “I would urge politicians of all parties to get behind the Mirror’s campaign. Child poverty is a stain on our nation’s conscience. It urgently needs fixing.” Action for Children’s director of policy and campaigns, Imran Hussain, added: “It’s great to see the Mirror getting behind these families and urging the government to throw them the leline they desperately need.” Judith Cavanagh, Coordinator for the End Child Poverty coalition said: “Ending child poverty in the UK is entirely possible and is what we, as a just and compassionate society, expects. It simply isn’t right that in , the year that child poverty was meant to have been eradicated, that poverty continues to restrict children so that they do less well in school, experience worse physical and mental health and have fewer opportunities in the future.  We fully support the Mirror’s campaign to call on the Government to tackle child poverty head on, as without a comprehensive child poverty strategy we will continue to watch child poverty rise. With ambitious policy making - like an increase to child benefit - we could see child poverty decline during this Parliament. This must be an ambition that politicians and public share.” The UK ranks as one of the worst countries for child poverty in Europe, figures from the EU-funded Eurochild show. Around . million children are at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the UK, a rate of .%, which is more than double that of some of our European neighbours. Only Italy , Greece , Bulgariaand Serbia , Romaniaand North Macedoniaranked worse. In France .% of children are at risk of poverty, while in Germany the figure is .%. Denmark , the Netherlands , the Czech Republicand Sloveniaranked amongst the lowest rates of children at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This is despite Slovenia’s national GDP being around  times smaller than the UK’s. Eurochild’s report is one of a number in recent years which has highlighted the growing issue of child poverty in this country. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, The English Indices of Social Deprivation, and the Social Metrics Commission all drew similar conclusions.

Matt Hancock made an impassioned plea when appearing on Thursdayaposs episode of Question Time in which he was hit with a flurry of quickfire concerns about the deadly COVID- strain. With the first British fatality from the disease confirmed hours before the live broadcast, this week from Tunbridge Wells, Mr Hancock said the Government is absolutely confident people will not go hungry. He said he and his colleagues are working closely with suppliers and supermarkets to ensure those in self-isolation are able to get the food and products they need - with the country preparing for a potential pandemic. On Thursday, the number of cases reported of the disease in the UK rose to , while the first fatality recorded in the country is understood to have been a patient at the Royal Berkshire NHS Trust and thought to be in her s. She was said to have been in and out of hospital for non-coronavirus reasons, it has been reported. A panicking Question Time audience member asked, in light of the apparent panic buying, how do we stop causing shortages by this   Mr Hancock replied: “There is absolutely no need for iniduals to go around buying more than they need. “And in fact, part of the response of this has to be about us coming together. “Obviously, the very strong advice from the scientists, the medics, is that people should not go about buying more than they need.” But the audience member responded that she had been to the supermarket before filming and there was no dry pasta at all, no toilet rolls.  “People are panic buying, she continued. There is no paracetamol that people can get. Mr Hancock said: I understand that but what I will say is the Government has supplies of the key things that are needed and within the food supply we are absolutely confident that there won’t be a problem there. And crucially we are working with the supermarkets to make sure thatpeople are self-isolating then they will be able to get the food and supplies that the people need. The first British fatality had been admitted into hospital on Wednesday when she was diagnosed with the disease, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan before becoming known to the public in December.

But in a result that stunned pundits, the former Vice President emerged as the frontrunner in what is now a two-horse race with Bernie Sanders. Sanders also won big, taking his home state of Vermont as well as Utah, Colorado and Calornia. But Biden won southern and midwest states while scoring a dramatic upset in Texas. He even took rival Elizabeth Warren’s home state of Massachusetts – where he did not appear in person and where Sanders had campaigned aggressively. The results ended the presidential hopes of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out yesterday.It is a remarkable turnaround for Biden, , who said: “We were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it’d be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy. Make no mistake, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.” Mr Sanders, , echoed him, saying: “We are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country.” So who are the two veteran politicians hoping to knock Trump out of the saddle and which campaign would you take a punt on  JOE BIDEN  Viewed as a hero by working-class voters, Biden served as Vice President throughout Barack Obama’s administration. As a key architect of the Affordable Care Act, healthcare remains his top priority – and for good reason, following a series of family tragedies. He lost his first we, Neilia Hunter, and baby daughter Naomi in a car accident in . And in , his lawyer son Beau died of brain cancer. Healthcare, he says, is “personal” to him. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, was born in  in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and moved as a child to Delaware. He still commutes from there to Washington. As a politician, he has maintained close ties to both states, though Trump has accused him of having “deserted” Pennsylvania. “I was in third grade,” Biden hit back. Biden maintains strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical election battleground that Trump won in . He has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia. Although not endorsed by Obama, he talks of their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from healthcare to foreign policy. And many Democrat voters, especially African-Americans, cite his relationship with Obama in explaining their support for him.  Over the years, Biden has changed his stance on many issues, bringing himself more in line with the Democratic Party of today. But some voters may find it hard to forget the senator he once was. He voted for the Iraq War as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the “tough on crime” era of the s, he voted for mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and increased funding for federal prisons – both policies contributing to mass incarceration. However, his fight for healthcare to be “a right for all”,  years of tackling climate change and openness to immigration all led to huge support. In addition, he has called for a rise in the minimum wage to £., released a criminal justice plan focused on prevention and supports same-sex marriage. He is also known as one of the most empathetic US politicians. But Biden is not without controversy, having been accused of inappropriately touching women – which he denies. If elected, he would be the oldest President to date at his inauguration, aged . BERNIE SANDERS  With an anti-establishment style that has changed little over five decades, Senator Bernie Sanders has attracted a loyal following. Born in New York and the son of a salesman and a housewe, he wed his second we, political consultant Jane O’Meara, in , honeymooning in Russia. A year later, they flew to Cuba hoping to meet Fidel Castro but had to settle for the mayor of Havana. Sanders has a son, Levi, from a previous relationship and three stepchildren. For most of his s and s, he lived “just one step above hand to mouth”, barely paying his bills as a jobbing carpenter and freelance writer. Sanders became interested in politics in  at a meeting in Vermont of the small, anti-war Liberty Union Party, raising his hand to run for the Senate. His bid was unsuccessful. He became an elected official in , as mayor of Burlington in Vermont. Ten years later, he was elected to the House of Representatives as Vermont’s sole congressman. In , he moved to the Senate. Some see him as a visionary. Sanders boasts some of his agenda items once considered radical – “Medicare for all”, an £. minimum wage, free public college – have now been embraced by many Democrats. Running for President a second time, he is one of the best-known candidates but remains something of an outsider.

The Prime Minister has urged Brits to avoid stockpiling essentials after images emerged of empty shelves in major food outlets, but has reassured he will keep the country fed. High Streets and shopping centres, meanwhile, were largely deserted on Thursday as people stayed at home - in part due to fears of contracting the virus which has already killed more than , worldwide since December. Mr Monteyne, now of investment firm Alliance Bernstein, said the deadly flu-like strain, which likely originated in Wuhan fish markets, could lead to drivers having to self-isolate meaning stores would struggle to re-stock. With warehouses tending to holding up to a fortnight of stock - and even less for perishable goods as well as bulky items like toilet roll, panic buying would quickly see stocks decimated. Crisis mode would then have to be implemented, with supermarkets joining forces to ensure people donapost go hungry, while the Army would be called in to guard stores, ex-retail boss said in a report. Only essential items would be stocked at this point, with depots, trucks and stores all heavily guarded by armed personnel to ensure an even distribution across the country. Yes, it will be chaotic , wrote Mr Monteyne, but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.  He went on to say the UKaposs biggest grocer, Tesco, is thoroughly prepared for protocol during pandemics, and assured the industry on a whole is well-prepared.  Yesterday the amount of virus cases had doubled in two days in Britain to  while pictures show supermarkets looking more and more depleted. As a result, shoppers have been warned by the likes of retail analyst Patrick OaposBrien not make unnecessary panic buys to avoid putting strain on the supplies available. Mr OaposBrien, of Global Data PLC, said people need to be thinking of the greater good with panic buying only encouraging others to jump on board. He added: We are seeing that online order slots at grocers are filling up are getting booked up for a couple of days ahead, which is highly unusual. Kerry Owens, marketing director at Karium which manufactures Cuticura hand gel, meanwhile, said immediate action had been taken to increase production on the product to meet demand get them on the shelves.  With the number of UK coronavirus cases having jumped up to , Mr Johnson said he would guarantee Britons were getting enough food. Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, the PM said banning big social gatherings and urging people to stay indoors wouldnapost work to stop the spread.

Patients with milder symptoms will be allowed to remain in the community and will now be instructed to self isolate and stay at home. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: Iaposm very sorry to announce that a patient earlier on today died of novel coronavirus. The patient was elderly and with underlying health conditions. Our condolences are absolutely with the family at what must be a very dficult time. The sht to stopping efforts to isolate infected patients in specialist centres is part of a move from the containment strategy to delay.  Only patients who are seriously ill with the virus will now be taken to hospital. Prof Whitty added: Where people have mild symptoms and they are clinically safe we think itaposs more pleasant for them to self isolate in their own home. Of the  Brits who have tested positive  of the  who have not recovered are now self isolating at home. Dr Susan Hopkins, infection director at Public Health England, said: Many of them are self isolating and only coming out of their bedroom to get food and water.

Aeron Williams first started noticing something was wrong four months ago when swallowing food became dficult and he had acid reflux. The -year-old was not too concerned however, and enjoyed Christmas at home in Nottingham with his partner Kirsty Legore, their one-year-old daughter Isla-Reign and his two step-children Isaiah, eight, and Isaac, four. When he went to the doctors and brought up the possibility of cancer the medical experts dismissed the idea.It felt like I was getting food stuck behind my chest, so when I went to the  doctors  they have me dferent medication for that, he told Nottinghamshire Live. I Googled the symptoms and came across cancer and I brought it up in doctors appointments, but they shrugged it off at first because of my age. Once or twice per week I thought food was getting stuck, then it progressed to once per day. Within a few months Aeron had lost kg and was regularly sick. When he went back to the doctors test revealed that he had a cm growth on his food pipe. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes and liver. During his diagnosis appointment, doctors told him he should realistically think about having months, not years, to live. I do not feel like Iaposm about to die, Mr Williams added.  Iaposve been up and down for the last few weeks. I know itaposs not curable. I was on a soft food diet but now Iaposm on a liquid diet, I have special drinks that are low amounts but high calories. I joined a football leagueas I was about  stone and now Iaposm about , and none of that is through healthy eating or exercise. I would really like to try and push the message of le insurance, because unfortunately being  I did not have this. The cancer crept up in a matter of months and Iaposm leaving my family with nothing. Kirsty was due to go back to university in September, but that has now been put on hold. Itaposs just so sad, she said. We were not expecting this. I was waiting for [the doctor] to tell me she was joking, that he had stomach ulcers, but thataposs not what she said. Itaposs been so dficult. Aeron is now due to have a stent inserted in his throat so he can eat. He will also have more chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, which could leave to further le-prolonging treatmentsuccesful. The family has now set up a JustGiving page to raise £, to pay for the funeral and help support his family in the future.I want to leave something behind because I do not want the kids struggling, Mr Williams added. It would make me feel better and more comfortable when I do go. Iaposm also planning on writing letters and recording messages for my children. I want them to remember who I am.

According to the NHS, the symptoms of coronavirus- which has claimed the lives of more than , people worldwide, are a cough, high temperature and shortness of breath.But these symptoms are similar to the common cold - so how do you tellyouaposve got a common cold or the virus  Professor Sian Grfiths, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the BBC that the only way to tell for certain is to take the test. However, there are some things you can look out for which may give you an idea that your cough might be something to worry about. Asked how to tell the dference, she said: Through the test, unless your symptoms go on to develop into chest disease and then youaposre more likely to have coronavirus. The symptoms tend to be fever, shortness of breath and a cough and a cold will probably have a runnier nose than that. But itaposs not foolproof and thataposs why the test is being done. There is a whole lot of testing being done through GPs and hospitals at the moment by Public Health England to seeweaposre missing any cases.  One of the other issues being discussed atis whether itaposs safe to shake hands. No official warning has been issued in the UK, but France has advised its residents to avoid doing it and Switzerland has told people to drop their everyday greeting of kissing on the cheek.London mayor Sadiq Khan has said he will not be shaking hands going forward, and the Queen wore gloves as she handed out MBEs, OBEs and knighthoods for the first time in more than  years. However Johnson insisted the coronavirus threat would not stop him greeting people with a handshake . But many medical experts are saying it might be time to start thinking about cutting the handshake. GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told the BBC: When we all walked into the BBC this morning, the charming people at the desk were all shaking our hands. “I know it’s very British and very polite, we probably ought to stop shaking hands.” The broadcasteraposs health correspondent Fergus Walsh agrees, and also warned that gloves wonapost solve the problem. He said: Gloves might help unless you then then suddenly touch your face, and youaposll be passing on maybe a whole load of germs that way.  We maybe ought to start thinking about not shaking hands any more. The French have advised that French citizens donapost kiss on the cheek so maybe we should be careful about who we kiss.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHave you heard the one about John Prescott and his saucy squirter  Not a sex toy. He just couldn’t resist spraying tomato ketchup over unsuspecting punters. Thankfully, it wasn’t real, just a long coloured string that spiralled out of a fake sauce bottle. Prezza’s favourite is one of the best-selling tricks on sale in what must be the country’s oldest joke shop, Dinsdales of Hull, marking its th year. The iconic store, with windows full of itching powder, fake dog poo, plastic rats and chattering teeth, is a stop on the city’s tourist trail. Visitors pose for pictures against a ghoulish backdrop that could be the props department of Hammer Films. Joke shop manager, Graham Williams, has been the joker behind the counter for  years, and embodies the business motto: “We sell laughter. Keep smiling!” Not everybody does. Dr John Sentamu, the chuckling Archbishop of York, couldn’t get enough of the ketchup crack. But when John Prescott gave Alastair Campbell the treatment on a Burnley v Hull City trip, Ali was not amused . Generations of Hull folk have come to Dinsdales for a laugh. The shop was originally a music store, and founder George W Dinsdale styled himself The Record King, a big deal in ‘Ull. He later branched out into selling American comics that came to the port as ballast in ships from the USA, and then into the joke business. His range of stock was – and remains – enormous. You can still buy cheeky little model “cameras” from the s, which show tiny stills of voluptuous women. Manager Graham confesses: “I only came here for the summer season for my uncle George Dinsdale in . I’ve been here ever since. I’m a bit like Peter Pan. I like to think that laughing keeps me young.” As we speak in the Hepworth Arcade, a Victorian parade of shops in the old part of the city – or what was left of it by the Luftwaffe – a lad comes in to ask for some exploding cigarette ends. “Sorry sold out!” There must have been a rush on tricks to humiliate smokers. “But we have stinkers. Only £.” “But are they really disgusting ” asks our hesitant buyer, Jayden Emmerson. Assured that they are, another satisfied customer goes off on his mission of mortication. Selling jokes is a serious business. In the time I was in the shop, around a dozen people came in. One lady wanted ginger hair dye. A man asked after a fake tongue, but they’re banned. Elf ’n’ safety. Halloween is the busiest time of the year, when queues form right down the Arcade. Bonfire Night is good for business, and Christmas, especially for office parties. You wouldn’t believe what women buy. But I’ll tell you all the same. Fake testicles you can squeeze until they pop out into your hand are popular, and anything  that can humiliate men.Most of the goods cost less than a fiver, but the Remote Control Fart Machine– “can be heard up to  feet away” – will set you back £.. This extraordinary instrument promises to deliver eight dferent trouser coughs, activated by an electronic device. And speaking of Donald Trump , Dinsdales’ best seller of  was the Trump rubbery full-face mask. “I’ve sold out,” grins Graham. “I had lots of little boys coming in here asking for a Trump mask. So funny. They didn’t know who the Prime Minister was, but they know who Trump is.” All Graham has left are cardboard versions, not quite the same, but still fun.But you can be the Queen, or a gorilla, or a ghoul. And you can buy a wig in any number of garish colours. I tried on this rather fetching green number, but I fear that it’s not really me."},{"url":null,"title":"more 1000 mini cab offices","story":"NewsMore than  mini-cab offices have been forced to close since the rise of UberEXCLUSIVE: Analysis for the Mirror by experts the Local Data Company revealed , closed.

The couple put on a confident display as they arrived in pouring rain at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at London’s Mansion House, smiling broadly as they stepped out of their official car. Amid the cheers there was one loud boo from an onlooker, however it did not spoil the mood, with Meghan telling the audience at the awards that it was aposnice to be backapos. They were there to honour the achievements of wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges over the last year. But all eyes were on Meghan, , who has not been seen in this country since she and Harry made the dramatic announcement that they were quitting public le in early January, much to the distress of the Queen. She upped the glamour stakes in heavy make up and a form fitting turquoise dress with blue suede heels and gold earring. Her hair was tied back in a pony tail. Staff would not reveal details of her outfit as is custom with other senior royals.

The album, which was unearthed by the family last year, contains some depictions of Nightingale, among the drawings by both families. The exhibition will also feature the watch that Nightingale wore throughout the Crimean War, on display for the first time.  Florence Nightingale Museum director David Green said: These two items bring us closer to two important aspects of Florenceaposs le - the Crimean War work which propelled her to fame, and her tight family bonds. The family album is a wonderful find ... Florenceaposs international fame endures because her achievements were utterly transformative and the whole exhibition is designed to surprise people whose knowledge of Florence Nightingale doesnapost go much beyond The Lady With The Lamp. Curators hope the exhibition, being staged  years after her birth, will shine a spotlight on Nightingale as an older woman.  Nightingale is often pictured in her thirties, when she nursed wounded soldiers in the Crimean War. The exhibition, in the grounds of St Thomasapos Hospital in London, aims to also remember the triumphs of the more mature woman. Nightingale rocketed to fame during the Crimean War, and became known as The Lady With The Lamp because she would check British soldiers throughout the night.  But she shunned the limelight and ed home as Mrs Smith. The new exhibition explores the next  years of her le, when she revolutionised nursing and transformed healthcare. She also suffered physical illness and depression, now thought to have been post-traumatic stress disorder.

A pregnant woman was among nine people crammed into two living spaces secretly built and converted inside the back of the shop unit in Bristol. When shocked council environmental health officers visited the property they found three of the nine people living there were sleeping in cupboards in the eaves of the roof, including two children. Housing chief Paul Smith described it as ‘some of the worst conditions’ that environmental health officers working in the field had ever seen, Bristol Live reports. The man who owned the shop and was the tenants’ landlord, was found guilty of renting out accommodation that was of such poor quality it ‘posed a serious risk to le’. Deepak Singh Sachdeva who owned the Premier store in Avonmouth Road, Avonmouth, did not turn up to court and was found guilty of a host of offences under both the Housing Act  and the  Houses in Multiple Occupation Act. The living accommodation was above the shop’s rear storage area, and the court heard it was found to be ‘of poor structural condition and design, posing serious risk to le due to inadequate fire separation and precautions’. “There was very poor fire resistant separation between the shop store and the flat above, with the floorboards of the living accommodation clearly visible from the storage area immediately below,” a council spokesperson said. “Other property defects included large gaps around fire doors, offering no protection from potential fire or smoke hazards. There was no working fire detection in place prior to emergency smoke detectors being fitted by the council. “One of the studio flats also lacked basic ventilation, with no external windows and limited access via a poorly maintained staircase,” he added. Singh Sashdeva, who lives in Surbiton in Surrey, was ordered to pay £, in fines, and with costs and a victim fund surcharge, he will have to pay £,.  “The magistrates felt that the high penalty reflected the money made from the tenants, given the severity of complete disregard for the safety of tenants, particularly children and the serious risk to le the property posed,” the council spokesperson added. The city council has beefed up its action on tackling slum landlords, and has brought in tougher licensing rules for HMOs across Bristol, and landlord licensing more generally in many parts of Bristol. “These were some of the worst conditions environmental health officers working in this field have seen,” said the council’s cabinet member for housing, Cllr Paul Smith.

Estate agent Claire Louise Ainsworth, , betrayed Jenner Scott, , after she was tasked with selling her home in Accrington, Lancashire, a court has heard.Ainsworth - who runs UK Online Agents Ltd - sold the property for £, but told Mrs Scott the deal was only worth £,, Lancashire Live reports.Burnley Crown Court heard how apospure greedapos led to Ainsworth, of New Lane, Oswaldtwistle pocketing the dference for herself. Her actions left Mrs Scott, who had previously bought and sold two houses through Ainsworthaposs business, feeling distraught and often tearful. Prosecuting, Stephen Parker told the court that Mrs Scott had considered the businesswoman - who was tasked with selling the house in Whalley Road in December  - a friend who she confided in. Mr Parker said: She told Mrs Scott that the selling price was £, while telling the purchaser that the price was £, plus an additional £, in cash. The fraud was uncovered when Mrs Scott later visited her former home to pick up any post and met the new owner, who mentioned the £, in cash, to which she replied aposI don’t know what you’re on aboutapos. Police were called and in an interview after her arrest Ainsworth denied any fraud. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Scott said she felt ‘totally betrayed’ by the agent, who ‘took advantage of my vulnerability’. She added: I’m often tearful about it. I can’t understand why she would do this to me. I’m sure that the stress of this caused a severe attack of shingles and my weight has dropped to seven stone. Ainsworth, a mum-of-two, was found guilty of one count of fraud by  representation last month. She had denied the charge and was convicted in her absence after failing to turn up for her scheduled trial.

He said her actions had been a aposone-offapos and that she had later transferred back £, of the cash taken to the house buyer on the advice of a solicitor. He said: She is a decent and talented estate agent. The business was very successful. She built it up and now she’s knocked it down with self-induced greed. This was a one-off. She essentially is the business as photographer, valuer and negotiator so it has now come to an end. It has no assets. Recorder Mary Prior QC told Ainsworth that she had ‘lied to everybody’ about the house sale and that her motive was greed as she was not in dire straits financially and at the time of the offence and was ‘in a good place in her le’. She said: Nobody now is going deal with an estate agent with a conviction for fraud. Ainsworth was sentenced to a nine month jail sentence, suspended for  months and ordered to perform  hours of unpaid work. She was also ordered to pay £, in compensation to Mrs Scott.

Campaigners National Tea Day said half of brands are targeting  to -year-olds as they are more likely to try new flavours than older drinkers. Researchers Mintel said: “Tea has seen something of a resurgence.” Millennials are choosing from detox brews and vitamin boosters to those with health benefits such as turmeric tea, which is said to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Trish Caddy, senior food service analyst at Mintel, said: “The popularity of tea amongst millennials is likely a reflection of the growing ­popularity of alternatives to the ­traditional cuppa. “Speciality black, green and fruit, herbal and spice teas are particularly popular among  to -year-olds. Many ingredient-focused drinks that give added focus to flavour and a sense of occasion suit young consumers. “That’s not to say they’ve abandoned the classic cup of builder’s tea as % of millennials drink standard black tea.”  Figures show the coffee shop market is set to top a record-breaking £billion this year, up from £.billion in .

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5f7607109c29.60228049-scaled.jpg ","title":"hemmings set to return says boss","story":"James McPake expects Kane Hemmings tofor Dundee against Ayr United this weekend.The Dark Blues’ top scorer missed last night’s frustrating draw with Alloa after failing to shake off a persistent illness.Despite creating multiple chances, the Dee drew a blank in his absence.But their manager expects to have him back in time to face the Honest Men.“Kano will come back for Saturday,” said McPake.“Kano was ill last night. He was ill at Queen of the South and, maybe stupidly, I played him when he wasn’t right.“But he’s now almost recovered and we’ll have him back for Saturday.”Dundee may have drawn a blank against the Wasps, but McPake was as delighted with his side’s performance as he was annoyed by the result.The Dark Blues fired  shots at the Alloa goal to no avail.Yet McPake took heart from the creative nature of his side’s showing ahead of a potentially pivotal double-header with play-off rivals Ayr.“We’ll take the positives for Saturday, we’re going down to Ayr then they’re coming here,” said McPake. vw, px\"  “It’s two massive games for our football club and,we perform like that, then we’ll give ourselves a right good chance.“At the minute, it’s sore but, though it was only one point, it’s another clean sheet. That’s one positive.“Another is, you could pick probably four or five games from earlier in the season and add our chances up – and we created more chances last night.“And the fans – for me that’s a positive because people keep saying they get on the players’ backs.“That’s rightly so because we haven’t been creating chances and giving them something to cheer, but you certainly heard them last night.“They were egging us on and really pushing.“I turned round during the game and said, ‘The atmosphere’s back’, and we need that.“It’s not a cry for help, but we need to keep producing performances like that to keep the atmosphere up, to keep the fans onside.“To keep them helping us we need performances like last night – with the goals added.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/5e5ce776b724e6.95875127-scaled.jpg ","title":"mcpake and dee make good use of idle saturday after arbroath clash called off","story":"Dundee mounted a spying mission on their next three opponents after Saturday’s clash with Arbroath was called off.With the Dens Park pitch waterlogged, the Dark Blues squad headed instead to an impromptu indoor training session at the city’s Regional Performance Centre.But the day wasn’t over for the Dee coaching staff.First-team coach Dave Mackay was dispatched to Ayr’s Championship win over Alloa, while assistant boss Jimmy Nicholl saw Dunfermline down Dundee United at East End Park.The Dark Blues face the Wasps tomorrow night, before a double header with the Honest Men is rounded off by a visit from the Pars a week on Saturday.And, despite gaffer James McPake’s irritation with the weekend call-off, he is pleased with how his staff worked it to their advantage. vw, px\"  “It was a frustrating one,” admitted James.“We’d worked all week in preparation for Arbroath and, by the time Saturday comes around, you’re desperate to get out there.“But, at the same time, the pitch was nowhere near playable and the referee who came in to do the inspection made the call.“It’s a pain but it’s part of football. The games are stacking up a wee bit but we just have to get on with it.“We trained on Saturday and it’s one of those occasions when we’re grateful to have access to the indoor facility at the Regional Performance Centre.“It was a good session, which kept us ticking over for Tuesday night, and there were actually positives to the game going off.“Dave watched Alloa and Ayr on Saturday afternoon and Jimmy went to Dunfermline against Dundee United, which was obviously useful for the days ahead in terms of preparation.“So there’s frustration but we took the good side of it, too.”Meanwhile, James reacted to news of the club’s latest financial figures.The Dark Blues revealed losses of £. million at teatime on Friday – more than four times greater than the previous year’s deficit .The figures show how heavily the cost of relegation has hit Dundee in the pocket, with squad and managerial churn blamed for much of the club’s increased expenditure.Financial predictions for next year are also bleak.But the club’s majority shareholder – Tim Keyes and John Nelms’ Football Partners Scotland– have committed, in a statement released alongside the accounts, to continue providing funds.For the manager, who has enjoyed daily support from Nelms, that came as no surprise.But McPake remains aware of the pressing need toas quickly as possible to the Premiership, given the havoc dropping into the Championship has wreaked on the club’s balance sheet.“Some of it I can’t control but the bit of it I can control is the budget I’ve been given,” he said.“Regardless of what  has been going on and wherever  money has been needed, the owners have backed me from start to finish.“I have absolutely no complaints on that front. That has been the same for every other manager they have employed here – they’ve all been backed.“What we can do on the playing side is, as I’ve said before, make sure come April, May time, we’ve given ourselves the best possible chance of getting back to the Premiership.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-glasgows-queen-barras-five-facts-maggie-mciver","story":" Maggie McIver, Queen of the Barras, had her first taste of business when she looked after a family friendrsquos fruit barrow in Parkhead.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Indeed, the suggestion has been made that any opinions counter to the management view have been distinctly unwelcome.Nobody is suggesting that Knapdale Ward is perfect, and common sense tells us that dementia patients are more comfortable and relaxed in their home environment. An enhanced community care model is an excellent idea # but healthcare professionals are adamant that Knapdale Ward should be retained, with improvements made in discussion with staff.It is needed, they say, as an option within Argyll when the home environment is no longer suitable for dementia sufferers, their families and carers.Serious questions need to be answered.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings. Labelled as a tomboy, butch and a lesbian, he accepted this as who he was and suppressed his feelings. It wasn#t until moving to Glasgow and being more involved with the LGBTQ+ community he gained a better understanding of himself and being transgender.Returning home to Lochgilphead, Josh came out as transgender, ultimately finding his true self.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"mr-roland-brett---appreciation","story":"THE business and sporting communities of the Scottish Borders have lost one of their leading lights following the death on February  of RolandBrett. He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles. Both my children called me separately to tell me there was a signicant fire at the High School, said Gareth.ldquoI could see the smoke from where I was in Peebles and made my way to the school.As the fire ripped through the building, Gareth captured events as they unfolded and wired them out to the national newspapers.He said: ldquoSending images to national newspapers of ongoing news stories was part of my everyday working le up until around  when I stopped working as a press photographer.\"Since then I have concentrated on commercial and editorial work.As firefighters worked tirelessly into the wee hours tackling the blaze, Gareth pictured the devastation and produced some harrowing images of Novemberrsquos fire.The following day the photographs were picked up and used by five national newspapers ndash The Scotsman, The Daily Star, The Sun, The Daily Record, and the Express.But Gareth wasnrsquot just a photographer taking sought after horric images for the media, he is also a parent of pupils at the school and felt emotionally invested.ldquoMy daughter Olivia is in th year and is presently studying for her Higher Photography.

It was amazing to have so many people wanting to attend and, in the end, we could have sold it out nearly three times over.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

At the time of writing this report officers would not recommend introducing a levy where there is a fragile economy and depopulation issues.‘This provision will be more effective in urban areas, particularly large towns and cities.‘It may not be effective within the Argyll and Bute Council area unless improvements are made to transport infrastructure, specically public transport provision, to allow the modal sht to be made from cars to other travel types.‘Improvements to the cycle’s network may also be worth considering in this context.‘The introduction of levies may, in some cases, lead to displacement of vehicles on to public roadsparking costs are passed on to staff.’The report also says that assessments would need to be carried out in order for any penalty charge notices for pavement parking to be implemented.Ms Flanagan added: ‘Pavement parkingis an area which would require a policy position for Argyll and Bute, in terms of what level of enforcement and where enforcement would be carried out.‘It is understood there will be minimum footway widths to be maintainedwhich won’t leave many places within Argyll and Bute where we could have footway or partial footway parking.‘There would be a need for an assessment to be carried out in local areas where we are aware that the prohibition may cause issues.‘The council would have to promote orders, provide signing and lining these may become cost pressures.

She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

the Tories would be backing the administrationrsquos five per cent rise and housing budget because it was about a long-term investment, not just one year.He said: ldquoIf we are going to ask people to

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels.

However, the issue that really concerned them was the tax burden and the fact that it seems to be getting worse.Take this weekrsquos news for example. According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget watchdog the Scottish Fiscal Commission, the business rates burden is likely to rise by % in the next three years, from pound.bn this year to pound.bn in  . The Government says part of the reason is that appeals made after the  re-evaluations are finally being settled it also wheeled out that old familiar excuse: ldquothings are worse in England. But the result is the same: businesses are going to have to pay a lot more tax.The  Barclay review into business rates, which was implemented by Holyrood on Thursday, was supposed to make things better and to some extent it will ndash reviewing the rates every three years instead of five for instance. But the opportunity for profound and radical reform has been missed. There will be no revolution or reinvention of the business rates system, only repair and patch-up.But even the patch-ups have not fixed many of the systemic problems. The assessment system, for example, still throws up gross disparities between dferent types of businesses. And even at three years, rates are not reviewed often enough which means a business can be paying tax based on an old model . City centre rates are also still way too high compared to the rates for out-of-town shopping malls, creating a disincentive to move into the centre of towns and cities where theyrsquore needed.And underlying it all is the problem that has yet to be tackled, which is that business rates are based on the old idea that most of us shop on the high street, which, as we know, is increasingly not the case. Indeed, at precisely the same time as British people have adopted the habit of moaning about the state of the high street, they have also adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries. In other words, British shoppers are decrying a situation which they helped to create and the tax system needs to reflect that.What this means in practice is reducing the tax burden on businesses on the high street and raising the money from where. In a world in which a chain as mighty as John Lewis is struggling , it cannot be right that firms that provide investment and employment are so heavily taxed. At the very least, the tax should be flexible so it can be zero-rated in areas that need new shops or when profits are falling or low. Indeed, why canrsquot we move towards abolishing business rates altogether To make up the shortfall, the system would obviously need to be reformed to raise taxes instead from those who can most afford it. In the business world, that would mean a large digital services charge on companies like Google and Amazon that are still paying grossly low levels of tax. It would also helpthe Scottish Government did what it once said it would and reformed council tax so itrsquos fairer and raises more money from the better-off.Moving towards such a system would involve an increased cost for ordinary taxpayers because digital companies would inevitably pass the cost on to their customers, and some people would have to pay more council tax. But we cannot go on as we are. The competition between the high street and online, between bricks-and-mortar and keyboard, needs to be fairer. And the system needs to be re-calibrated so that tax is never so high that it damages business.Most importantly, however, the Scottish Government, and Scotlandrsquos councils, need to change their attitude to the high street and stop squeezing the goose for more eggs. The goose, Irsquom afraid to say, is ailing. The goose might die. We need to stop acting like itrsquos still big and fat and juicy."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-ask-serious-questions-benefits-scottish-parliament-brings-scots","story":"Is it time to have a forensic look at what benefit,any, the Scottish Parliament brings to Scots Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.TRULY, therersquos none so blind as those who wonrsquot see.

Struan Stevensonreveals an equally profound misunderstanding of my own country. Amongst his many wilful misinterpretations, his reference to ldquohellipattempts to break up Canadarsquos -year-old unionhellip is particularly revealing. The UK is a union Canada is a Confederation. Canadians routinely refer to their ldquofederal government. The federal nature of its governance is what has kept this geographically, linguistically and culturally erse country together.The two referendums on Quebec independence reinforced this federalism and changed the whole country. And even that may not be enough to save the confederation, whose fate still hangs in the balance. By contrast, there is not, and never has been, anything remotely federal about UK governance. The UK is the most centralised of all the democracies. It is as far from any kind of Canadian federalism as is possible. The idea that it would ever embrace such federalism is disingenuous nonsense.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation is now missed very much. It was an independent local organisation for the people of Orkney.#Ms Taylor, along with former colleagues and supporters, feels that there is now a big void in community mental health services. They are interested in hearing thoughts, views and ideas regarding a proposed new venture called Orkney Open Door Counselling, with the eventual aim being to source funding and sponsorship for the running of a service and its premises.The closure of OACAS, which was announced shortly before Christmas, has caused a great deal of upset in the community, with several clients and former staff members sharing their concerns with The Orcadian. The service#s former chairwoman, Chloe Jowett, has said that #years of underfunding# and a history of #undervaluing# community mental health services in Orkney was behind its abrupt and unwelcome demise.All are welcome at the public meeting, due to be held at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, on Saturday, March  at pm.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"advertising sales representative full and part time at the shetland times ","story":"The Shetland Times Ltd is looking for a bright, enthusiastic and energetic advertising sales representative who must be a team player.This is a full-time post,  hours per week, am-pm Monday-Thursday, am-pm Friday.It is an opportunity to sell our range of promotional packages to current clients and prospective customers.As a part of our sales team you will meet clients face to face on a regular basis as well as make telephone sales calls.You will play a key role in selling and administering advertising and promotional offers.and is capable of meeting ious publication deadlines.A good understanding of Microsoft Office suite, keyboard skills and high levels of literacy and spelling are expected.Marketing sales experience would be an advantage.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

The disease, whilst the dots in the map are increasing, it hasn#t yet exploded into the country.So we#re following the advice about personal hygiene. Clearly you would imagine in terms of what I need to do with senior colleagues is to make sure our preparedness is at optimum.Mr Byrne also expected staffing levels to be reduced, through both illness and by those needing to care for family.Our commitment is to continue to staff the  service, respond to emergency calls and respond to serious crime and terrorism, he said.He added that extra care would be needed in areas of increased risk of infection such as custody centres.It#s easy to speculate some sort of scenes from a horror film or a famous Hollywood movie where we#re dealing with pandemic and virus, he said.But at the moment our assumption is actually that as people fall ill, that will quieten down the calls for service from us.Our priority is to encourage people to remain calm through a period of uncertainty. We#re all probably facing a unique experience that we#ve not seen the like of for a  years.Options to cope with reduced numbers include -hour shts and cancelling rest days.The PSNI chief added: We#re not complacent and we can use a lot of experience here from operating at pace in dferent times. Whether it#s dealing with complex investigations or serious disorder to keep officers and staff available to work.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: Worried Northern Ireland mum stockpiles £ worth of suppliesA worried Northern Ireland mother has stockpiled £ worth of food and household supplies as a precaution against any shortages caused by the coronavirus crisis.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_---e-eafe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_---e-eafe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_---e-eafe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_---e-eafe_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_---e-eafe_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusCoronavirus: Seven new cases confirmed in Republic of IrelandSeven new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.Republic of IrelandIreland to ban mass gatheringscoronavirus outbreak worsens People in the Republic of Ireland will be banned from attending funerals and bringing their children to crèches under the Government#s worst case scenario plans to tackle the coronavirus.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Michael KenwoodMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA funding row has broken out at Belfast City Council over an international grassroots boxing championship to be held this summer.Representatives from the Ulster Boxing Council went to City Hall this week to appeal for help in financing the  European Schoolboys and Schoolgirls Boxing Championships.But they left empty-handed after a bitter debate resulted in a deferred decision.Sinn Fein proposed that the event receives an immediate cash boost of £, from council underspend this year, on top of £, already committed before its initial application. Ulster Boxing has also approached Sports Ireland, the Northern Ireland Department for Communities and Tourism NI for funding. If funding is confirmed, the competition - to be held in Queen#s Physical Education Centre- will run from June -July  and will be streamed on the European Council#s YouTube and social media s.Liam Corr, Belfast Boxing Development Officer, told councillors: This is the biggest grasroots boxing tournament in the world. It is the first time the event has come to the city, so it is a major coup. Mr Corr anticipates between  and  countries will attend, with around  participants. We also envisage it will bring , people to the city over the  days of the competition, and will bring between £.m to £m in revenue to the city, he added.Sinn Fein councillor Ciaran Beattie said: The boxing championship starts in three months# time. Three months to organise a European championship, so bed nights have to be booked, halls have to be booked, equipment needs to be booked.When it comes to boxing, there is always an issue, it has to be delayed and delayed and delayed. My personal view on this, and I have said it at committee, is that there is a bias in this council against boxing.Alliance councillor Michael Long told the council there were a lot of dferent priorities for council savings.UUP councillor Jim Rogers said: This council has become a bottomless pit.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappToday, many people will be facing the consequences of the collapse of Flybe.March   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMany people will be facing the consequences of the collapse of Flybe. There will be those frequent fliers who have come to depend on the airline providing the only direct route to the destination of their choice. Others will be facing the prospect of losing out on a short city break or holiday and many regional airports will have lost an airline that was responsible for more than % of its departures.Belfast City is one such airport. Almost % of flights in and out of the airport were Flybe. I am pleased that the airport is already in negotiations with other airlines, and I hope that staff can find jobs, routes can be re-established and regional connectivity can be maintained. Of course, we all recognise there are commercial issues at play, butthe government wants to provide real, practical assistance for regional connectivity, the simplest thing that they can do is scrap Air Passenger Duty . For years, the tourism industry and businesses leaders have highlighted the damaging impact that this tax has had on the UK as a whole, but particularly on Northern Ireland as we compete with Dublin Airport. More than most other regions, we depend on domestic air travel and we have to endure the double hit of APD being imposed on the outbound anddomestic journeys. It makes it more expensive to fly and consequently more expensive to do business, and more costly for tourists to come here. Other countries have seen the impact of such taxes and have abolished them. In the Netherlands, the tax generated €m in revenue, but Dutch airports lost , travellers and it cost the Dutch economy €.bn. Much will be said about the role of government in supporting regional connectivity and airlines such as Flybe. However,the government wants to further unleash the potential of UK regions, bolster our tourism industry and support business, few decisions would be more beneficial than abolishing Air Passenger Duty.

In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs Long revealed that relations between the DUP and Sinn Fein in the new Executive are more strained than before because of three years without devolution.But she said there was more open debate and a healthier atmosphere around the table than previously.The Alliance leader said that next week#s Renewable Heat Incentive inquiry report shouldn#t be used as an opportunity for the parties to tear strips off each other and make things more dficult.Rather than a highly personalised response targeting iniduals, the focus should be on reforming the system to ensure that past mistakes are never repeated.Amidst speculation about explosive exchanges with Arlene Foster during the talks to restore devolution, Mrs Long said it was totally untrue to suggest she disliked the DUP leader.I have no trouble looking at the % vote threshold and saying, that#s our next challenge. You have to aim high. There is no ceiling on my ambition for AllianceOn a personal level, I like Arlene and get on well with her, she said. We probably clash because we#re both direct and straight talking sowe disagree on something we go head-to-head, not around each other#s backs.I prefer that approach to politics. I welcome getting to know Arlene better as First Minister around the Executive table. There is no personal animosity at all.Mrs Long said her party had started  hoping to break through the % vote barrier. She was shocked at how quickly it had grown, securing % in the Westminster poll and .% in the EU election, where it didn#t scrape the third seat but took the second.

Mrs Long said: I have no trouble looking at the % vote threshold and saying, that#s our next challenge. You have to aim high. There is no ceiling on my ambition for Alliance.I would love us to become the largest party in Northern Ireland. I don#t know that it will happen on my watch but I want to build the foundations. Mrs Long said her party#s membership had doubled in two years. She believed it could now win Assembly seats in West Tyrone, Upper Bann, East Londonderry and North Antrim next time and take two in some other constituencies so it would be challenging for between  and  seats and added that she had no regrets about entering the Executive rather than going into opposition. You can#t ask people to make compromises when you#re not willing to do so yourself, she said. I don#t want to be outside the room criticising what#s going on, I want to be inside trying to shape it. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals. It#s about addressing the systemic failures and ensuring that those things done wrong in the past won#t happen againShe said it wasn#t an easy executive, it#s dficult. The parties would cross swords at times but there had been no fireworks. There was an open, healthy debate at the table.There are some bumps in the road ahead, she said. The budget will be dficult, the RHI report won#t be easy. But it should not be used as an opportunity to tear strips off each other and make things more dficult. The biggest challenge is to avoid thisbecoming highly personalised and about iniduals. It#s about addressing the systemic failures and ensuring that those things done wrong in the past won#t happen again.She said she didn#t knowthe report would recommend police investigations, potential prosecutions for illegality or whether the conclusion would be that the RHI scheme was just badly managed.She said progress had already been made on addressing some of the issues raised at the cash-for-ash inquiry - codes of practice and pay for special advisers, ministerial accountability, transparency and record keeping.On the murder of Paul Quinn, Mrs Long called on Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy to specically and unambiguously state that the -year-old Cullyhanna man wasn#t a criminal. I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previouslyWhen you#re a politician, you have a lot of influence. What you say carries weight in the community. You#re an opinion-former. So when you say somebody#s a criminal, that has implications for whether people are willing to come forward with information to the police, she said.It is important that Conor does say that Paul Quinn wasn#t a criminal. The pain that Breege and Stephen have been through is horrendous. Their son#s awful death was added to by the fact that he was smeared publicly.They live this nightmare every day. I would hope that Conor would find it within himself to bring a measure of peace to this family.Asked about the possibility of a border poll in her letime, Mrs Long said the chances had increased due to Brexit.I wouldn#t be as presumptuous as some to say a border poll is inevitable in five or  years, but I do think it is more likely than it was previously, she said.The theme of Alliance#s conference is # Vision# and the party will be celebrating its th anniversary.

The party#s director of finance Des Mackin told The  Sinn Fein has experienced a surge in membership applications since the Irish general election in February and now expects to recruit more staff on the basis of increased representation in Leinster House. Sinn Fein#s finances will soon further improve as money continues to be released from the estate of the late WilliamHampton, who gted millions to the party after his death in a nursing home in Wales in January . It#s thought the estate of the eccentric millionaire which benefited Sinn Fein to the tune of £m is worth at least twice that amount after the discovery of leads involving more than two dozen bank accounts globally. Money held in UK accounts has already been given to the party. Meanwhile, property in the UK and Ireland that formed part of the estate is being sold, while approximately €mis being released from an account in Singapore. That transfer should be done by the end of the month, Mr Mackin said. The whole thing should be done by the end of the year.Rules around political funding mean the money cannot be spent in the Republic but will boost Sinn Fein#s financial position. The executors of Mr Hampton#s will were Mr Mackin and prominent Belfast republican Joe Cahill, both Sinn Fein national treasurers at the time. As well as four headquarter buildings in Dublin and Belfast, local branches of the party own a further  or so properties used as constituency offices. Mr Mackin said the party has received , membership applications and  applications to join its youth wing since the Irish general election was called - bringing total party membership to ,. He said Sinn Fein is able to employ more staff for the party because its activist ethos means people are prepared to work for less. Former party leader Gerry Adams is heading up a new unit within the party to ensure Sinn Fein remains focused on its ethos of achieving a united Ireland, he said. Everything should be thought of in terms of a united Ireland. It is important to ensure and promote the united Ireland vision, to make sure it goes right through and that all our policies are thought of in those terms, he said.

Aoe Clarke, from Ballykelly, is an Engagement Ambassador for VOYPIC and told the County Derry Post that the evening was a great success.She said: “We had a few children singing the Bare Necessities and they had the whole crowd going.“It’s a  to highlight and show appreciation for the talents of these young people that might get bypassed in other areas.“It gives them a chance to stand on that stage and show who they are. One young boy performed his own rap at the event.“It was about being in care, his le at home and his feelings and emotions towards his social workers. Everyone in the room could relate to it.”The -year-old credits the organisation with a great deal of her own success.She said: “I became known to the organisation when I was about   and without them, I don’t think I would be where I am today.“I grew up care experienced and lived on the edge of care my whole le but at , I was made homeless. I lived in Jefferson’s Court on Shipquay Street.“That’s when I became known to VOYPIC, because I wasn’t getting what I was actually entitled to. If you are classied as a LAC, you are provided accommodation by social services.“I wasn’t. I was completely overlooked.”VOYPIC plays a crucial role in making sure that young people in care have access to the support and information they need to make informed decisions about their lives.With offices in Derry, Belfast, Ballymena and Lurgan, another aspect of the charity’s work is filling gaps in the information available to young people in and on the edge of care.Aoe says it is easy for some young people to slip through the cracks.“A lot of young people living on the edge of care can easily fly under the radar and I don’t think information is publicised enough for them to know what they’re entitled to.“I had a really bad experience with the teachers in secondary school because they just didn’t get it at all. It’s hard to expect people to get itthey’ve never received any training.”Aoe is currently in her final year of a psychology degree at Ulster University in Coleraine and, in her role with VOYPIC, is determined to make a dference to those currently re-living her experience.“I’m doing my dissertation on educational pathways to rd level education, specically for care leavers.“A lot of the students I’ve interviewed indicated they weren’t aware of the support available to them – we want to change that.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

All Flybe flights, and those operated by Stobart Air, have been cancelled. Therefore, anyone who has booked with Flybe from Belfast City Airport is advised not to go to the airport as your flight will not be operating. Flybe customers are therefore urged to make their own alternative travel arrangements via other airlines, rail or coach operators. For flights operated by Flybe franchise partnerspassengers should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements. googletag.cmd.push The UK Civil Aviation Authority will provide advice and information to consumers, so check their website and Twitter feed @UK_CAA for more information. Commenting, Richard Moriarty Chief Executive at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: “This is a sad day for UK aviation and we know that Flybes decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its employees and customers. “We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Flybe flights are cancelled. For the latest advice, Flybe customers should visit the CAA website or the CAAs Twitter feed for more information. googletag.cmd.push “Flybe also operated a number of codeshare partnerships with international airlines. If you have an international ticket you should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements.” Reacting to the Flybe news, Jenner McKeever, Director of Airporter in Derry, said:“The news that Flybe has gone into administration is dreadful news. “Flybe has provided a vital service for thousands of commuters who use the airline on a regular basis to travel from Northern Ireland to work in Britain or further afield. “As a peripheral region, connectivity for NI is absolutely crucial, whether it’s to encourage inward investment, to encourage indigenous business to expand and sell to other markets, or to encourage more visitors to the region, flights into and out of Northern Ireland are key to investment, business growth and tourism. “The loss of this service will be hugely damaging to our economy because it breaks that connectivity from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Not only does it make le harder for many businesses who rely on these regional routes, but it also will have an impact on our tourism industry at a time when we are trying to attract more visitors to our shores.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Each visit brings a new opportunity and on what will be the first Derry game played on grass this season, Devine is hoping for a change in fortune at Waterford.“Theres a lot of excitement but we have got to make sure that the excitement that we are generating is also fulfilled with hard work and the ability to grind out results and that is key at this stage of the season,” he said. “Its not about the beautul game to be honest. Id rather go to Waterford which is a dficult venue and be able to dig out a brilliant win than be very expansive and pretty and lovely on the ball and come away with a - defeat.”Waterford are hoping to avoid a third successive home defeat as well as score their first home goal of the season, but Devine is just focusing on his team.“Its key for me that they continue to trust each other and continue to know each others strengths and weaknesses and to understand what way we want to evolve as a team. “Its very much a work in progress,” he explained.“It was fantastic that we got three points last week but the key now is going to get another three points. Its very dficult, we didnt win there last year, we threw away a - lead with  seconds in the game and we took the lead down there the last time and conceded a poor goal from a corner. “We didnt win in the RSC last year and we know its going to be extremely dficult down there this year because they are spitting a bit of fire as well. “They will be disappointed to have lost their last two, but they also showed a lot of quality when they went to St. Pats and won -.” googletag.cmd.push PotentialDevine is excited at the potential in his squad this season and he is expecting big things from the young players going forward.“Its a very young side – there were five players under  who finished the game,” he added. “A lot of them are playing in this league for then first time. The omens are good. I back these players and I back the players with a lot of experience to help these players. We had a great week last week but we now have to try and have another memorable night in the RSC.“You could go through the Waterford team and theres a lot of talent in there and a lot of experience, but theres also a lot of players who can hurt youyoure not right so were under no illusions. “Its going to be a big battle down here. Its our first game on grass so it has the makings of a fantastic game. I know Alan Reynolds very well and he will very determined that they dont lose three home games in a row.” Ciaran Collwill have a late fitness test ahead of tomorrows game, while Ally Gilchrist remains a doubt after suffering concussion against Bohemians. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
