He doesn\u0027t contact us. John was quite delicate all along.\u0027Indeed his lifestyle in South London is so reclusive and quiet — and his attitude to fame so hostile — that the band apparently don\u0027t expect him to respond when they contact him.His wife sometimes tells callers to their home that he \u0027doesn\u0027t live here\u0027, or that she \u0027doesn\u0027t know where he is\u0027.Neighbours say that they are aware that he lives next door, but they barely see him from one year to the next. The only exception was the local pub, where he used to call in three times a week for a glass of white wine with his wife — but it has now become a supermarket.So why is he so reclusive?          This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private.

A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next?

Oxfam claims no UK jobs have been lost, though some sources dispute this.Kenya is a controversial choice for a charity struggling to put its house in order. According to anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, out of 180 nations it is the 37th most corrupt Britain is the eighth least corrupt.There were protests in Kenya last year over the £50,000-a-year wages of the country\u0027s MPs compared to the average wage of £1,000 a year. Some were claiming £15,000 a month in mileage allowance.The UK Charity Commission is one of the world\u0027s strictest watchdogs. Oxfam says its new HQ answers to the Kenyan foreign ministry.One of the worst cases of sex abuse by Oxfam aid workers in Haiti involved Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan from Nairobi, who has denied any wrongdoing. After failing to act over sexual harassment claims against him by female Oxfam staff in 2010, later, when he was accused of using prostitutes at his Oxfam villa, one of his bosses joked: \u0027Can he turn off his libido I wonder?\u0027The mystery over Oxfam\u0027s Kenya move has been fuelled by Ms Byanyima\u0027s secret Memorandum of Understanding and Host Country Agreement with Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta.Oxfam says it gives it \u0027tax relief\u0027 on its HQ and \u0027goods imported for official use\u0027 but no \u0027personal tax benefits\u0027 or \u0027immunity against law breaking\u0027. It refused to give further details.One aid expert said: \u0027By cutting their tax bill in Kenya, Oxfam is depriving Kenya of cash to build its own schools and hospitals itself. Charity leaders rage against private companies which avoid tax.\u0027In 2015, Ms Byanyima and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused \u0027corporate tax dodging\u0027 companies of robbing the poor of vital public services.At face value she and President Kenyatta are not natural allies.          Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Ms Byanyima\u0027s former loverShe is a passionate human rights campaigner he was accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity for allegedly inciting election violence in 2007 in which 1,200 Kenyans died.She runs big aid projects he says Africa should \u0027give up aid\u0027 because it hinders progress.When Mrs May visited Kenya in August, Kenyatta complained she was the first British Prime Minister to visit for 30 years and appeared deliberately to forget Boris Johnson\u0027s name.Most intriguing of all is Ms Byanyima\u0027s complex, lifelong political and personal relationship with Uganda\u0027s president Yoweri Museveni who, at 74, is clinging to power even though he is hated by millions of Ugandans. In the 1980s she fought alongside him in guerrilla war that saw him seize power. She was also Museveni\u0027s lover, but later married his personal doctor Kizza Besigye – according to some reports, after Museveni refused to leave his wife for her.Museveni fell out with Besigye, who became Uganda\u0027s opposition leader and has fought and lost four elections to him – with wife Winnie at his side. She is a member of her husband\u0027s Forum for Democratic Change party.Besigye fled the country claiming his life was at risk. When he returned Museveni tried and failed to jail him on rape charges. But Ms Byanyima\u0027s political fortunes continued to thrive in Uganda and beyond, rising to become United Nations \u0027Gender Development\u0027 director in 2006.Cynics said that Museveni helped her, a claim she denied, while admitting she still met him in a political capacity.Now, in another twist, it is said she is plotting to succeed him as president of Uganda herself – with her new HQ in nearby Kenya a convenient launchpad. In a recent BBC interview she said she would be \u0027honoured\u0027 to lead her nation. Challenged about her \u0027long personal relationship\u0027 with Museveni and whether it was \u0027in conflict\u0027 with her Oxfam duties (it has big aid projects in Kenya and Uganda), she showed a rare flash of anger – apologising for doing so.But she could not control her ire. Museveni had no right to \u0027entrench himself in power\u0027 and it was Oxfam\u0027s – and her – job to \u0027energise citizens in defence of his assault on Uganda\u0027s constitution\u0027, she said.It was the call to arms of Winnie the African bush fighter – and worlds away from the UK Charity Commission\u0027s non-political rule.A former UK Cabinet minister with experience of overseas aid said: \u0027When British donors give to a British charity they do so with a sense of assurance it is regulated by the Charity Commission. It is hard to see how this can happen if Oxfam is run from Kenya.\u0027You could create a British \u0027badge\u0027 for a charity , then run it from abroad with little or no control. Oxfam has questions to answer.\u0027      It declined to give full details, saying the Kenyan government had not published the HCA.Oxfam said that aid programmes had traditionally been run by Oxfam GB and other \u0027affiliates\u0027, but since 2015 \u0027to be more efficient Oxfam began shifting them from affiliates to OI, and since 2017 all programmes have been run by OI\u0027.Oxfam later claimed OI had taken charge of \u0027staff management\u0027 of all aid projects, not the entire programmes.The switch of power from Oxfam GB to OI is part of the charity\u0027s \u0027One Global Oxfam\u0027 campaign. But the behind the scenes tensions it has caused at Oxfam GB can been seen in its annual report last year.Tellingly, it said: \u0027This process has been challenging as it involves Oxfam GB giving up power. In the past we managed, spent and accounted for the money we raised from the British public and institutions.\u0027Now we share this responsibility with others and act as a partner rather than a manager.\u0027The Charity Commission confirmed OI is not registered with it.A commission spokesman said that in a recent investigation shortly before the Haiti scandal into claims of sexual harassment by Oxfam staff, it asked Oxfam GB to safeguard staff where it had \u0027shared responsibilities, in particular with Oxfam International\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/12/51AF92E400000578-0-image-a-4_1540640420368.jpg","title":"Harry pregnant Meghan attend Invictus Games basketball match","story":"    All smiles: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle addressed the packed closing ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday night    Jubilant: The pair are pictured at the Invictus Games on Saturday night in their last engagement in Australia before heading to New Zealand on Sunday morning          Meghan addressed the buzzing crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena which can hold 21,000. Meghan said: \u0027During this year\u0027s games in Sydney, I\u0027ve witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors.\u0027  In a short speech to the 12,0000-strong crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena, Meghan thanked organisers and athletes for making the Games so special          The Duchess said: \u0027It is such an honour to be here tonight, celebrating all of you and supporting my husband in the Invictus Games which he founded four years ago.\u0027    Prince Harry took the stage to rapturous applause.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

She is pictured putting on  parachute with the US Army in Italy          Meghan Markle shakes hands with a group of sailors and gets a tour of the USS Ross in Spain when she visited bases while working on Suits  Ryan Patrick Novack of the United States competes in the Mens 400m in Sydney. Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

The most stolen items are often mobile phones – while it’s tempting to check your phone when on the move, ensure you’re being sensible with where you make calls and texts.

Keep your bag where you can see it, ideally in front of you or diagonally across your chest.4. Conceal your wallet in a buttoned or zipped pocket where it doesn’t bulge.5. If you’re using a cash, ticket or oyster machine, be wary of who is around you and make sure your pin is covered.6. Thieves often work in groups, so try not be distracted by commotion or attention which could be a ploy.7.

He had famously sold it for £1 to City investors the year before.Sometimes the texts would arrive before daybreak, sometimes late at night, as Green tried to bully me into meeting with him.I asked my office to tell him that I could not help him in any way, especially if he was concerned about The Pensions Regulator’s ongoing investigations into the BHS pension scheme. The company had a £571million pension deficit and the Regulator was examining calls for Green, who had run BHS for 15 years, to contribute to the scheme (which he eventually did, to the tune of £363million, in February 2017).But Green refused to accept the response from my office, and continued to bombard me with texts and phone messages.Part of one such text, sent late at night on February 1 2016, read: ‘...I am happy to wait till wed night after which I will go where I have to go. This is not a threat but I have to look after our business I trust you will understand. As I have said you dont even know what I want to talk to you about. Look forward to your reply thankyou.’I received another at 05:34 am on February 2 and several more that day, including the following at 20:34: ‘Am I to take it there is no chance of a meeting if no I will have to do or go wherever u feel. Not looking to cause you any problems but u can’t just do nothing.’He simply would not take no for an answer. I asked him to put in writing what it was he wished to discuss. I asked him to explain why he needed to see me. But he refused to say and just replied in riddles.If I had been a man, I believe he would have replied more courteously and at the very least told me what he wished to talk about. He was playing games with me. He seemed to feel entitled to behave like this – complaining that he was a big employer and hectoring me: ‘This is crazy we need a solution.’The pressure increased as he persuaded other people to call me to intervene on his behalf.I explained again that I would not break with protocol to meet him while he was under investigation. He then accused me of behaving ‘exactly like the Regulator’ – Lesley Titcomb – and levelling accusations of incompetence against us both.To be treated like this was frightening and frustrating. Men who insult and demean women in this way need to realise that such behaviour is simply unacceptable. I was hugely grateful to my loyal officials who tried to protect me against Green’s bullying tactics.When I left office in July 2016, the BHS saga was still rumbling on. It was after I gave evidence to the Parliamentary Committee investigation into the failure of the BHS pension scheme that the bullying began again.Green phoned me to warn me not to speak against him, that I should shut up and not talk about the situation. Again his threatening tone was deeply disturbing. Being subjected to such intimidating behaviour is a terrible strain on mental wellbeing.Green was pictured on the phone while walking through the Sabino Canyon recreation area on FridayPerhaps he would argue that he treats both men and women in this manner, but I do not believe that is true – and even if it is, no woman should have to put up with this any more.Once, it was the norm for men to belittle women in the workplace. When I began my business career in the City of London in the early 1980s, it was a male-dominated bastion of testosterone-fuelled machismo.Lewd, crude comments, swearing and sexual innuendo were rife. Men would discuss their sexual exploits after business trips or weekends away. I felt uneasy much of the time.Nearly all female staff in those days were in secretarial or administrative roles and treated with disdain, regularly insulted and rudely criticised, both about their competence and their appearance.Professional women were few and far between, and I was often the only female in meetings, or in the Directors’ Dining Room, usually feeling uncomfortable at the conversation going on around me. I wish I’d spoken up against this sooner and I am ashamed I was too intimidated to do so.The sad fact is that it’s very probable that nothing I said would have done any good.In those days, if you wanted to make a success of your career, you just had to put up with it. But as I became more senior, it became easier to tell colleagues this behaviour was unacceptable. And over time, things have definitely changed.Having more women in Parliament, as well as the promotion of more women into senior roles in the workplace has helped, while stronger legislation helps to protect us against misogyny, bullying and intimidation.Most men have accepted the new realities. However, there are still some who seem not to have moved with the times.In particular, there has been a noticeable increase recently in attempts to cover up sexual harassment, such as the use of non-disclosure agreements for female staff working at the now notorious President’s Club men-only charity event in January this year, or financial payoffs by powerful men to silence women who say they experienced sexual or racist harassment.This would suggest there is a creeping danger of the bullying, macho, behaviour of yesteryear making a resurgence. These abuses must be rooted out and the perpetrators condemned.Women too often have been silenced and bullied into submission. I know what this feels like: it takes its toll on self-esteem and mental equilibrium. So I feel I must speak up for the sake of future generations of women.Let us be clear. It is not acceptable for powerful men to treat anyone rudely or with disdain. But it is certainly not acceptable for men to bully women and entirely wrong for men to try to buy women’s silence.Many of us have fought hard for women’s progress over the years. We know what it was like before and do not want to return to those times. If we do not call out the unacceptable behaviour now, there is a danger that it will become more widespread.We’ve made enormous strides in achieving recognition and respect, in moving towards equality, but we cannot rest easy.

He was a prolific social media user who promoted wild conspiracy theories targeting the Clintons, former  Obama and Muslims on Twitter and Facebook.But this is not how former classmates remember Sayoc when he attended North Miami Beach Senior High School, where he played soccer and had plenty of friends.He graduated from the high school in 1980. On his LinkedIn profile, Sayoc said he then attended Brevard College in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and claims to have studied veterinary medicine.David Templer, who remembered him from high school, told DailyMail.com: \u0027I don\u0027t think you will find anyone that knew him back in the day who will suggest this was expected. \u0027Cesar was not weird or off in any way that I recall.

He is seen above (second from left) with teammates in 1982          Brevard is a small, private Methodist college in Western North Carolina. The photo above shows Sayoc fourth from right. It was taken in 1981Sayoc’s father is Filipino and his mother is Italian. However the steroid-abusing bodybuilder claimed to be of Native American descent because he was trying to create an identity - which he found by becoming obsessed with Trump, Lowy revealed.\u0027He doesn’t seem to recognize reality. He lives in a fantasy world,\u0027 Lowy said to local outlets. \u0027The signs of mental illness are clearly there\u0027.      Sayoc is charged with five federal crimes, including interstate transportation of an explosive, illegal mailing of explosives, threats against a former president, threatening interstate communications, and assaulting current and former federal officers.Sayoc will face the charges in federal court in Manhattan after an initial court appearance in Florida. Five of the improvised devices involved in the case were recovered in the Southern District of New York. The former male stripper has a chequered history, including a criminal past which started nearly 30 years ago and includes arrests in 2002 for threatening to ‘blow up’ Florida Power and Light and an arrest in 1991 for grand theft auto. Sayoc, 56, was taken into custody on Friday morning in Plantation, Florida in connection with the 14 suspicious packages that have been discovered this week          Sayoc is seen at a Trump rally. He was arrested on Friday in connection with a string of bombs sent through the mailLowy, who represented Sayoc in four prior criminal cases, said the suspected mail bomber had trouble articulating concepts and \u0027doesn’t live life in a normal way\u0027. He also claimed that Sayoc demonstrated \u0027a complete lack of comprehension of reality\u0027.\u0027You talk to him and he speaks like a 15-year-old, like a child. This seems like such a sophisticated crime, I have trouble believing he had the mental capacity to create operating bombs\u0027. Sayoc’s mother found out her son had been arrested when she woke up from surgery Friday, Lowy said.\u0027My heart goes out to these people because you couldn’t imagine a more decent and loving family. They did everything they could,\u0027 he said.Disturbingly, Sayoc’s former boss at a pizza restaurant told how he openly admitted being a ‘white supremacist’ who was anti-gay, anti-Jewish and ‘wanted to purify society’.

The van was adorned with \u0027a billion stickers,\u0027 she said. She explained that at times there were KKK stickers and at least one sticker with a bulls-eye over a photo of Hillary Clinton on the vehicle. Sayoc, she said, \u0027loved Adolf Hitler\u0027.She revealed: \u0027If you didn’t fit his profile, you should go to an island and the island should be obliterated,\u0027 said Gureghian, who worked in a civilian role for the Massachusetts State Police for 23 years before moving to Florida. ‘Yes, he called himself a white supremacist and he called himself a Nazi supporter,\u0027 Gurighian replied.

John was quite delicate all along.\u0027Indeed his lifestyle in South London is so reclusive and quiet — and his attitude to fame so hostile — that the band apparently don\u0027t expect him to respond when they contact him.His wife sometimes tells callers to their home that he \u0027doesn\u0027t live here\u0027, or that she \u0027doesn\u0027t know where he is\u0027.Neighbours say that they are aware that he lives next door, but they barely see him from one year to the next. The only exception was the local pub, where he used to call in three times a week for a glass of white wine with his wife — but it has now become a supermarket.So why is he so reclusive?          This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, in the summer.\u0027In an interview with a fansite some years ago, Deacon said his hobbies were drinking tea and having children.These days John Deacon\u0027s great passion is said to be golf — hardly the soul of rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next? Maybe John Deacon will go to see the new film, in which he is played by American actor Joseph Mazzello.But if he does, you can bet he will do his best to slip into the local cinema as just another anonymous face in the crowd."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/26/23/061B3CEA000007D0-6322479-Chancellor_Philip_Hammond_is_expected_to_say_he_wants_to_make_ou-m-7_1540594775242.jpg","title":"British couples able married pubs new marriage law changes","story":"    Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to say he wants to make \u0027outdated\u0027 rules around wedding venues simpler by reducing red tape and will announce a review of marriage lawHalloween-mad grandmother, 51, who is dubbed \u0027Scary Mary\u0027...\u0027Have fun at the ball\u0027: Autistic 5-year-old mistakes bride...Share this articleMr Hammond is expected to say he wants to make \u0027outdated\u0027 rules around wedding venues simpler by reducing red tape.The review of the laws on civil ceremonies in England and Wales would be conducted by the Law Commission. It will also consider how to accommodate increasing demand from couples to have a legally binding ceremony outdoors, which is currently permitted only in Scotland.To get a licence to hold weddings a venue must currently identify a specific area where the ceremony will take place.     The review of the laws on civil ceremonies in England and Wales would be conducted by the Law Commission and will also consider how to accommodate increasing demand from couples to have a legally binding ceremony outdoorsIt must be part of a building rather than in the open air or a marquee.The licence holder must also undertake that no food or alcoholic drinks are sold or consumed in the area one hour before and during the proceedings. Ministers believe this means many small business owners are put off trying to get a licence, restricting choice and driving up the cost for couples.Relaxing the rules could make it cheaper and simpler for couples to get married but there will be concerns about how the dignity of ceremonies will be preserved.The Church of England last night responded to the announcement with caution.

Oxfam claims no UK jobs have been lost, though some sources dispute this.Kenya is a controversial choice for a charity struggling to put its house in order. According to anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, out of 180 nations it is the 37th most corrupt Britain is the eighth least corrupt.There were protests in Kenya last year over the £50,000-a-year wages of the country\u0027s MPs compared to the average wage of £1,000 a year. Some were claiming £15,000 a month in mileage allowance.The UK Charity Commission is one of the world\u0027s strictest watchdogs. Oxfam says its new HQ answers to the Kenyan foreign ministry.One of the worst cases of sex abuse by Oxfam aid workers in Haiti involved Raphael Mutiku, a Kenyan from Nairobi, who has denied any wrongdoing. After failing to act over sexual harassment claims against him by female Oxfam staff in 2010, later, when he was accused of using prostitutes at his Oxfam villa, one of his bosses joked: \u0027Can he turn off his libido I wonder?\u0027The mystery over Oxfam\u0027s Kenya move has been fuelled by Ms Byanyima\u0027s secret Memorandum of Understanding and Host Country Agreement with Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta.Oxfam says it gives it \u0027tax relief\u0027 on its HQ and \u0027goods imported for official use\u0027 but no \u0027personal tax benefits\u0027 or \u0027immunity against law breaking\u0027. It refused to give further details.One aid expert said: \u0027By cutting their tax bill in Kenya, Oxfam is depriving Kenya of cash to build its own schools and hospitals itself. Charity leaders rage against private companies which avoid tax.\u0027In 2015, Ms Byanyima and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused \u0027corporate tax dodging\u0027 companies of robbing the poor of vital public services.At face value she and President Kenyatta are not natural allies.          Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, Ms Byanyima\u0027s former loverShe is a passionate human rights campaigner he was accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity for allegedly inciting election violence in 2007 in which 1,200 Kenyans died.She runs big aid projects he says Africa should \u0027give up aid\u0027 because it hinders progress.When Mrs May visited Kenya in August, Kenyatta complained she was the first British Prime Minister to visit for 30 years and appeared deliberately to forget Boris Johnson\u0027s name.Most intriguing of all is Ms Byanyima\u0027s complex, lifelong political and personal relationship with Uganda\u0027s president Yoweri Museveni who, at 74, is clinging to power even though he is hated by millions of Ugandans. In the 1980s she fought alongside him in guerrilla war that saw him seize power. She was also Museveni\u0027s lover, but later married his personal doctor Kizza Besigye – according to some reports, after Museveni refused to leave his wife for her.Museveni fell out with Besigye, who became Uganda\u0027s opposition leader and has fought and lost four elections to him – with wife Winnie at his side. She is a member of her husband\u0027s Forum for Democratic Change party.Besigye fled the country claiming his life was at risk. When he returned Museveni tried and failed to jail him on rape charges. But Ms Byanyima\u0027s political fortunes continued to thrive in Uganda and beyond, rising to become United Nations \u0027Gender Development\u0027 director in 2006.Cynics said that Museveni helped her, a claim she denied, while admitting she still met him in a political capacity.Now, in another twist, it is said she is plotting to succeed him as president of Uganda herself – with her new HQ in nearby Kenya a convenient launchpad. In a recent BBC interview she said she would be \u0027honoured\u0027 to lead her nation. Challenged about her \u0027long personal relationship\u0027 with Museveni and whether it was \u0027in conflict\u0027 with her Oxfam duties (it has big aid projects in Kenya and Uganda), she showed a rare flash of anger – apologising for doing so.But she could not control her ire. Museveni had no right to \u0027entrench himself in power\u0027 and it was Oxfam\u0027s – and her – job to \u0027energise citizens in defence of his assault on Uganda\u0027s constitution\u0027, she said.It was the call to arms of Winnie the African bush fighter – and worlds away from the UK Charity Commission\u0027s non-political rule.A former UK Cabinet minister with experience of overseas aid said: \u0027When British donors give to a British charity they do so with a sense of assurance it is regulated by the Charity Commission. It is hard to see how this can happen if Oxfam is run from Kenya.\u0027You could create a British \u0027badge\u0027 for a charity , then run it from abroad with little or no control. Oxfam has questions to answer.\u0027      It declined to give full details, saying the Kenyan government had not published the HCA.Oxfam said that aid programmes had traditionally been run by Oxfam GB and other \u0027affiliates\u0027, but since 2015 \u0027to be more efficient Oxfam began shifting them from affiliates to OI, and since 2017 all programmes have been run by OI\u0027.Oxfam later claimed OI had taken charge of \u0027staff management\u0027 of all aid projects, not the entire programmes.The switch of power from Oxfam GB to OI is part of the charity\u0027s \u0027One Global Oxfam\u0027 campaign. But the behind the scenes tensions it has caused at Oxfam GB can been seen in its annual report last year.Tellingly, it said: \u0027This process has been challenging as it involves Oxfam GB giving up power. In the past we managed, spent and accounted for the money we raised from the British public and institutions.\u0027Now we share this responsibility with others and act as a partner rather than a manager.\u0027The Charity Commission confirmed OI is not registered with it.A commission spokesman said that in a recent investigation shortly before the Haiti scandal into claims of sexual harassment by Oxfam staff, it asked Oxfam GB to safeguard staff where it had \u0027shared responsibilities, in particular with Oxfam International\u0027. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/25/22/51A38BC400000578-0-image-a-6_1540503508065.jpg","title":"GYLES BRANDRETH reveals people think forget simple comma","story":"    Language is also power, and how we use it defines us.

It\u0027s the richest language in the world. It\u0027s our heritage — and our hopeAnd it is not only children. Three-quarters of adults now use emojis to communicate with one another. If a small digital image — designed by someone else and generated for you — can express how you feel, who needs words?Punctuation is essential to clear communication. Without punctuation, no one knows what\u0027s going on. It is crucial . . . but the rules are changing. Spelling is important today in a way that it wasn\u0027t when Shakespeare was a boy.Grammar isn\u0027t set in stone. Once upon a time, to split an infinitive was wrong, wrong, wrong. Since the coming of Star Trek in 1966, promising \u0027to boldly go where no man has gone before\u0027, we\u0027ve all been at it.The rules may change, but it is important to know them, nonetheless. Here is the Brandreth guide to grammatical howlers and how to avoid them.          The main clause tells you the main thing: \u0027Travellers worry about their luggage.\u0027 The subordinate clause is exactly that — subordinate, giving you that little bit of extra information that\u0027s not quite so important: \u0027Most of the time.\u0027It\u0027s clear what this means: He liked Nigella, who cooked pasta better than Delia.Equally, it is clear this next sentence means something else: He liked Nigella, who cooked pasta, better than Delia.Don\u0027t use commas too frequently, but do use them:1) When you want your reader to pause: \u0027Do concentrate on this, please.\u00272) When you want to give emphasis to an adverb: \u0027I am saying this, loudly, so that you take it on board.\u00273) When you decide to omit a word to add drama to what you are saying: \u0027The night was young, his hopes were high. The dawn had arrived, his hopes were dashed.\u00274) If you are addressing someone by name, put a comma before the name to avoid confusion — such as, \u0027I fancy your sister, Basil.\u0027Lose the comma and apparently you have the hots for an Italian nun: \u0027I fancy your Sister Basil.SEMI-COLONSThis won\u0027t take long it\u0027s important, believe me.Read that last sentence out loud and you should see exactly what the semi-colon is doing. It\u0027s providing a pause that is longer and more significant than a comma, and less abrupt and intrusive than a full stop.For those who relish nuance in their punctuation it\u0027s the go-to punctuation mark. I love the semi-colon for my money, it\u0027s undervalued and underused.It should be used between two main clauses that balance each other — or contradict each other — but are too closely linked to be written as separate sentences: I love my wife she loves me. I love my cat my dog doesn\u0027t give a damn.You must use a semi-colon when a comma is replacing a full stop in a quotation, or a quotation is linking two separate sentences: \u0027I\u0027m so sorry to have to tell you this,\u0027 he said \u0027your cat has croaked.\u0027      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/27/00/04BF2385000007D0-0-image-m-30_1540597506589.jpg","title":"Newcastle Council considering telling people recycle LESS","story":"    In Newcastle, yoghurt pots and margarine tubs cannot be recycled whereas Reading will accept these itemsIt would mark a huge turnaround after years of residents around the country having to separate rubbish into more and more bins to help hit recycling targets. Plastic is often too contaminated with food waste to be recycled meaning local authorities have to pay to send it to landfill or an incinerator.Currently UK households face 39 sets of rules over what plastics they can recycle.

Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

She tells us about her meditative approach and why ‘thinking too much is boring’A translucent bubble floats in the air next to a picture of a baby’s head cradled tenderly in an adult’s arms. Nearby, among an arrangement of similarly intimate images, an infant’s tiny hand is gently enfolded in an elderly grandparent’s grasp. On a single wall in the National Portrait Gallery, amid the contrasting styles and subject matter of the 2018 Taylor Wessing portrait prize, Rinko Kawauchi’s vivid images of four generations of her family create a quietly intense space in which to pause and ponder the beauty and fragility of the everyday.Recently, that sense of life’s frailty has become more acute for Kawauchi following the birth of her daughter, whose first few years have been captured in characteristically hypnotic images. Since Kawauchi’s arrival on the art scene in 2001 with the simultaneous publication of three photobooks, Utatane (“Catnap”), Hanabi (“Fireworks”) and Hanako (a Japanese girl’s name), her family have featured in her work alongside often breathtakingly beautiful photographs of the natural world – insects, rainbows, clouds, butterflies and, of late, sacred rituals and ancient sites in her native Japan. She is an artist of the quotidian sublime, creating a world in which the tiniest details – a slice of watermelon on a plate, a bird’s egg cracking open – are imbued with meaning as part of the greater whole, the great interconnectedness.The images on show at the NPG are a continuation of an ongoing project that began with her 2005 book, Cui Cui, which comprised photographs of extended family taken over the previous 15 years. In that time, she witnessed the death of her grandfather and the birth of her nephew. It is not, though, she insists, a work of “personal disclosure” – rather a visual contemplation of the cycle of life in all its sadness and wonder.She is, she tells me in her faltering but often poetic English, “in sympathy with small things in the bigness of nature”. Her approach is patient, deeply attentive, akin to a kind of heightened meditation. “It’s about finding a certain space of mind, if that makes sense. When I am shooting, I am following my intuition without thinking. Thinking too much is boring, not good. It stops the surprising from coming through. When a picture happens, I just say ‘thank you’ and move on. It is only afterwards that I become an editor and impose the meaning on the work.”In person, the diminutive Kawauchi is quietly spoken and self-contained one senses that her work is an extension of her self. It is difficult to imagine her operating in the combative world of commercial advertising photography, which she did for several years after graduating from college in the early 1990s. She cites the American master of the everyday William Eggleston as a formative influence, alongside the younger Japanese photographer Takashi Homma. Her early images, which often seemed like deftly composed snapshots, were bathed in natural light and washed with bright colour tones that added to their almost dreamlike quality.In 2004, Martin Parr gave her two gallery spaces when he guest-curated Les Rencontres d’Arles, and in 2006 she had a solo show at the Photographer’s Gallery in London. Back then, I noted that her work “might initially appear to approach the deadpan detachment that characterises so much contemporary art-photography, but on closer inspection there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile.” That remains the case, but, of late, her vision has widened and deepened. In 2013, her series Ametsuchi announced a departure of sorts. Using a large format camera mounted on a tripod, she shot from a distance, creating panoramas of the stark, elemental, volcanic terrain around Japan’s Mount Aso, a sacred site for Shinto pilgrims who gather there to perform often spectacular fire rituals.Last year, Halo continued her exploration of these bigger themes. In rural Japan and China, she photographed other religious fire rituals and the vast constellations above. On England’s south-east coast, she captured the wondrous natural spectacle that is the murmuration of starlings. The private and the everyday had suddenly given way to the celestial elemental, the tranquil to the spectacular. And yet, they remained Rinko Kawauchi photographs: striking, luminous, poetic.“Halo is really about the relationship between nature and the manmade,” she says, “There is something about time passing in all the work and, with Halo, it is about a practice that is unchanging for hundreds of years while the world changes around it.”Her work is changing in other ways, too. When she began making work, Kawauchi gravitated towards the photobook as the perfect medium for her closely observed images of the world around her. Now, she is intrigued with the possibilities of the moving image. To this end, in 2015 she created an installation in a gallery in Shinjuku of video works mounted on 30 monitors, her images, both intimate and elemental, unfolding to an ambient soundtrack of natural noises – wind, insects – and “music created on real instruments”.I ask her, in conclusion, if being a mother has changed her approach to her work. She thinks for a long moment. “I would say yes, but not in the expected way. In my personal life, it has been amazing of course as a photographer, I am not so sure. When I feel happy, I see no reason to make work, but sometimes there is this hunger to make work. So, it is complicated. I need this hungry spirit and the calm. I need the balance to find the story inside me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8bce6f61e8817dbaf4a9ea94c8254fa47107ba6/10_50_1990_1194/master/1990.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=49f6b5f24ba7ed237c6480a63950a442 2020w","title":"the art of pumpkin carving in pictures","story":"“Pumpkin carving is an ephemeral art,” says Marc Evan. “The fact that pumpkins rot does not diminish their beauty or the experience of seeing them in person – if anything, it makes it more special.” Over the past 10 years, Evan and childhood friend Chris Soria have made a business out of carving pumpkins – and not just to scare.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

She talks politics, swearing – and how poetry has changed since she started writing“Combover ... twitter-rat, tweet-twat, tripe-gob, muckspout” … so runs the first stanza of “Swearing In” by Carol Ann Duffy. “That was fun to write”, the poet laureate says, laughing. The poem uses kennings, an ancient form that describes something using compound words – in this case a Duffyesque litany of insults, mixing medieval and Elizabethan phrases with modern or invented coinages (“tie-treader”: “he wears very long ties”). “‘Mandrake mymmerkin’ … I’ll leave you to research that,” she says. If you haven’t guessed the subject, the poem ends: “welcome to the White House”.In her new collection, Sincerity, her last as laureate, Duffy is not pulling any punches. “I like the word ‘sincerity’,” she says. “To speak and act out of one’s beliefs, thoughts, feelings.” She was also drawn to its etymology, derived from the way in which “dodgy sculptors” in ancient Greece and Rome would conceal mistakes or flaws by covering them with wax. So “without wax” (sine cera in Latin), “means genuine, not duplicitous,” she explains. “I liked that as a title.”She spent much time ordering the selection so the poems “speak to each other”. It is not a very polite conversation: “A Formal Complaint”, which follows “Swearing In”, is even more to the point. Again she has fun with another ancient form, this time the sestina, used – as the title suggests – to make a political objection, in which six key words are rotated in a strict pattern as line endings, all coming together in a furious finale. Her choice words – “arseholes”, “gatekeepers”, “chancers”, “tossers”, bullshitters”, “patriots” – give the general idea.Isn’t it all a bit, well, sweary for a poet laureate? She pulls a face. “I think the past couple of years, with the evil twins of Trump and Brexit … I don’t remember ever having felt such a kind of lowering abstract stress coming from the political aura. It’s just so demoralising. You feel powerless,” she replies. “There was no way of not writing about that, because it is just in the air.”But Sincerity is also very personal, with quieter poems on bereavement and the less talked about grief, or “shy sorrow”, of a child leaving home. She set out “to see where I am at this age”, her early 60s: “I think poets should write not only from somewhere but from somewhen.” Like her poetry, Duffy is disarmingly direct, warm and a little bit fierce (sincere, even), with a steeliness that comes, perhaps, from growing up the elder sister of four brothers in working-class Stafford. Poetry, she says, should never “be up its own arse”.Compared to her bestselling collections, the tender sexiness of Rapture (2005), or the comic rowdiness of The World’s Wife (1999), Sincerity may appear angrier and more political, but she has never been afraid of speaking out. She captured the Thatcher years in her early collection The Other Country, but the situation today is “much worse” even than the 80s. “I’ve never ever thought ‘I’m going to write a political poem’,” she says now. “It is just the relentless pressure of it that squeezes those kinds of poems out of you.”She stresses “how the political moves out of the personal”, for example in one of her new poems, “Britannia”, which connects the Grenfell fire last year with the Aberfan tragedy in 1966. “I remember my father talking about the negligence of the coal board allowing that slide. Fifty years later we are all traumatised by Grenfell … these national disasters that have a principle or cause about them.” The one constant, as the last line has it, was “the dutiful Queen visiting”.There is a refrain of mourning running through Sincerity. “I’m putting down markers for things that we can lose,” she agrees, such as “civil society or a way of having grace in our public lives”, but also for more private losses. “You have dead parents,” “The Rain” ends, brutally. “As anyone who has lost their parents knows, it can take a very long time to feel comfortable with all the happy memories and being back in the world,” she reflects. It took her two years to write about her mother’s death, which she did in her gentle 2009 elegy “Premonitions”. (A vigorous, youthful May Duffy was celebrated in the lovely poem “Before You Were Mine”.) In this collection she writes of taking her mother’s wedding ring off her finger when she died: “the small o in love and loss”. She also revisited a much earlier poem, “Dark School”, after her father died in 2011 in the very classroom where she studied Latin as a child, her convent school having been converted into a nursing home. The poem “seemed to have a kind of prophetic quality to it – it was very, very strange,” she says now.“Empty Nest”, for her daughter Ella (Duffy is an unashamedly doting mother), is at the heart of the collection. “When our children leave and go to university and start their lives it’s a very hidden grief,” she says. “We tend to be stiff upper lipped, but it is a real blow. You still are a parent, but that kind of daily devotional ritual is gone.” She plans to put together an anthology on the subject “so that people have somewhere to go with that sorrow”.Her favourite of all her poems, “A Child’s Sleep”, from Meeting Midnight (1999), was written when Ella was only 18 months old, and might be a bookend to “The Empty Nest”. “I stood at the edge of my child’s sleep hearing her breathe ...” The lunchtime clatter of the London station restaurant seems hushed as she recites the poem from memory, then explains how she wrote it: “there was a full moon outside the window, so it was as if the moon was looking at me looking at her. It was quite an extraordinary moment.” Her voice, a wandering mix of her parents’ Irish lilt and the flat Scots of her childhood, has a hypnotic quality, well-suited to her incantatory verse.For Duffy, there is another ending looming: in May she steps down as the nation’s official poet, anticipated in the mischievous poem “The Monkey”, about a real monkey she encountered in Marrakech, but also about “the idea of anarchy … of stopping one life and starting another one”. When she was appointed in 2009 much was made of her sexuality, and the fact that she was the first woman, and the first Scot, to become poet laureate in the position’s 400-year history. (She brushes off the 1999 brouhaha that ensued when her predecessor Andrew Motion was chosen over her because Tony Blair reportedly thought she might be too bold a choice for middle England, as so much tabloid “crap”.) But she is reluctant to comment on broader cultural issues such as the #MeToo movement or identity politics. For her, the role is all about being an ambassador for poetry.“I don’t think the poet laureate is the ‘best poet’,” she says, not for the first time. “I think the poet laureate is a representative poet.” And she has been a tireless champion of her fellow poets: even her readings are usually billed “Carol Ann Duffy and friends”. One of the standout experiences of her laureateship was Shore to Shore, “a bus-load of poets on a grand tour” picking up more poets along the way. The first was in 2016, when they travelled from Falmouth to St Andrews, coincidentally “with the Brexit vote right in the middle” – a great way “to hear all the voices and all the reasons”.She organised a small reading for a party at Buckingham Palace five years ago including Caribbean poet John Agard, the 2012 winner of the Queen’s gold medal for poetry, who gave a rousing rendition of his “Alternative Anthem”, with its refrain “put the kettle on”. “That was a great moment: seeing the Queen join in saying: ‘Put the kettle on!” Another highlight was being on board the Queen’s barge for the jubilee celebrations: “An incredible dream. It was such a shame it was raining.” (Duffy was below deck with a whisky.)One of her earliest public poems as laureate was “The Last Post” in 2009, to mark the deaths of the last veterans of the first world war (she has just edited Armistice, a centenary anthology published this month) her most recent was for the marriage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in May. “Their wedding ended with what they called ‘the long walk’ going up to Windsor Castle and I remembered how we all watched when he was a little boy behind his mother’s coffin and what a hideous long walk that was, a terrible situation for a child to be in and yet here he was, and here we all were watching him again.” But don’t expect a poem for the new arrival: she’s never felt a royal baby poem to be “necessary”. Although she feels no obligation, she wrote “The Crown” to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation, because “I do get the sense that whether or not you are a monarchist or a republican, people respect and admire the Queen very much.”She is an ideal laureate in that she is happy to accept a wide range of commissions, a willingness I can vouch for having asked her to write poems for this paper on events including the Scottish referendum, the 2012 Olympics and the Manchester Arena bombing last year. The reaction to these responsive, immediate verses has inevitably been mixed, especially on Twitter, which she avoids fellow poet Ian Patterson was particularly damning about her Stephen Lawrence poem. But such sniffiness has been rare. It’s a question of “trying to keep your finger on the pulse of what people might be interested in, or where the voice or the language of poetry might be worth adding to the kind of national babble and blether and jabber,” she says.Poetry has changed a great deal in the 10 years of her tenure: “We have Instagram poets, performance poetry has exploded, there’s much more ersity.” When her first collection, Standing Female Nude, was published in 1985, she was introduced “as a poetess”, she says incredulously. “You can tell by the title of that collection, that I was keen on asserting feminist principles.” Sadly, “we still have a way to go”.Her mantra is borrowed from Picasso: “Inspiration will come, but it must find you working.” When she is at home she is at her desk, either in her study, at the kitchen table, in an attic library or in the garden (she had to resist having a special rain-shelter desk built). It rains a lot in her poems: “I live in Manchester, what do you expect?” she retorts. “Also, I like poems with rain in.” She has literally surrounded herself with poetry, there are even poems on her doors, handpainted by the artist Stephen Raw: Robert Herrick, “So Good-luck came, and on my roof did light” on the study “Snow” by Louis MacNeice George Herbert’s “Prayer” and – inside the kitchen – William Carlos Williams’s “This Is Just to Say”. Poetry, she says, “comes out of silence.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said. Wonderful.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

He said he respected the opinion of lawyers who disagreed with his intervention, but that he stood by his decision to name the retail tycoon, who had secured an injunction preventing details of the case from being revealed.“I stand resolutely by what I’ve said and neither retract nor apologise for standing up for human rights,” he said. His comments, made in interview with the Observer, come after Green said it was outrageous for Hain to have named him, and that he would lodge a formal complaint with the House of Lords.Green also criticised Hain for not revealing his links to the law firm that had been working with the  in its efforts to name him. He repeated that “to the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.Hain said: “Parliamentary privilege is a precious part of our constitution and an expression of parliament’s absolute sovereignty, but it should only ever be used sparingly, with total integrity and responsibility,. It is not something that one should ever abuse and it should never be used randomly.“On this occasion, I took a judgment, which others will, in turn, assess as being right or wrong and I respect that. I respect the view of lawyers who criticise it, though others have supported it.“I have no quarrel with the appeals court or with any members of the judiciary on this point. They have a job to do, but so do parliamentarians. What is the point of being a member of parliament, either in the Commons or in the Lords, if you don’t discharge your responsibilities and, where appropriate, use the privileges that you have in order to promote justice and liberty?”The former attorney general Dominic Grieve is among those to criticise Hain. He said he had abused parliamentary privilege and acted arrogantly.It has emerged that Hain was a paid adviser to Gordon Dadds, the law firm instructed by the  in its attempts to name Green. Hain has said he took the decision to name Green “in my personal capacity as an independent member of the House of Lords. I categorically state that I was completely unaware Gordon Dadds were advising the  regarding this case”.A spokesman for the law firm denied “any suggestion that Gordon Dadds LLP has in any way acted improperly”.Of his previous uses of parliamentary privilege, Hain said: “I used parliamentary privilege to name a dozen arms dealers who were flying in arms to Sierra Leone, some of which were turned on British soldiers trying to defeat the terrorist group there,” he said.“Arms were also being sent to Angola, fuelling a bloody and traumatic civil war, and to the Congo, where they were also being used to promote conflict. These arms dealers were being paid in illegal diamonds.“On the second occasion, I was passed information by very brave whistleblowers to whom I was introduced by ANC stalwarts horrified by what was going on under President Zuma’s corrupt presidency.“So that is three times during my time as a parliamentarian, dating back to 1991. So it is not something i have ever done lightly. The first two cases were clear cut, though it hadn’t been done before. And on this third occasion, obviously I did not do this lightly, either. It was after deep consideration.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6687de310d2f02bfaa905cb1ba6f3be869334b34/0_210_6288_3773/master/6288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c07b79dc68072adfc6528235c2f15b1","title":"uk air travellers waste 175m a year on allocated seating report finds","story":"Civil Aviation Authority says almost half of people who pay to sit with companions would be seated together anywayBritish airline passengers are wasting up to £175m each year on unnecessary allocated seating fees, new research has found.The aviation regulator urged airlines to tell customers how likely it is they will be split up unless they pay extra.Allocated seating generally costs between £5 and £30 a seat, although some of the most sought-after seats cost up to £100.The CAA found between 6.8 million and 10.4 million passengers are spending £74-£175m “unnecessarily” on the fees each year.It discovered cases of passengers with reduced mobility paying extra to sit with their carer despite airline regulations meaning this should happen free of charge.Parents highlighted concerns of being separated from their children even though guidance states they should be sat together to speed up an evacuation in the case of an emergency.Aviation Minister Liz Sugg said: “Passengers rightly expect to be charged fairly for services and allocated seating is clearly a concern for those flying.”CAA policy director Tim Johnson said: “Charging for allocated seating has clearly become part of airlines’ pricing strategies, which can impact especially on certain groups such as those with accessibility needs and those travelling with young children.“We are also concerned about how transparent and easy it is to compare prices and make an informed buying decision.“Today we are proposing a new framework, following engagement with stakeholders, which will be used to assess airline seating practices.“This includes transparency, options to add information about travelling with children, older people and those with accessibility needs.”This is the chance of being separated from your companions if you do not pay for allocated seats on nine major airlines serving the UK, according to CAA research: "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e8fec963e76d5b662068605c6d08c5d09caf2f0/0_130_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=133231804fdc18d0576d711a986654b4","title":"work once way to better life not any more property pensions","story":"It is often said that people are defined by their work. Whether the job is in mining, teaching or engineering, it provides an income, status, friends and a sense of community.Yet for a long time now work has become secondary to being a savvy consumer, a homeowner (or, better still, a multiple homeowner) and a pension saver. It’s not a trend the Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party recognises. But it’s a sad fact that a job is no longer the primary route to a better life, unless promotions – which often only add to the stress and long hours that employers already demand – are part of the plan.If workers have any spare time, it doesn’t go into campaigning in their workplace for better terms and conditions. It is spent in the long queue at Aldi and Lidl for cheaper food. It is spent scouring the newspaper best-buy tables for a cheaper mortgage deal, a lower energy tariff or discounted car insurance.And if there is a hint of a cut to a worker’s pension, they will leap up and vote for the party that promises to protect their entitlements, and even consider industrial action.In part, this change reflects a rolling back of labour laws and with them the sense of solidarity among workers. It also follows the shift to an economic model that relies on workers to be more accommodating each year in their role as business and consumer service providers.The irony is that when the consumer is made king, workers are forced to become even more flexible, providing services on a 24-hour cycle, usually to the detriment of their own health and wellbeing.Some politicians have sensed that the tide is turning, and that workers have had enough of flat wage growth and employers that seek to improve profits almost exclusively at their expense.It was clear once the promised bounceback from the financial crash failed to materialise that the trend for ever-worsening conditions and meagre pay needed to change.George Osborne’s answer as chancellor was just to raise the minimum wage. Theresa May’s speech on taking office was to argue that workers should be more actively involved in the workplace. She even pledged to give workers seats on boards, putting them at the heart of corporate decision-making.Corbyn’s rise to the top of the Labour party has also brought with it an emphasis on workers and workers’ rights. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has a vision of an economy made up of cooperatives and worker-influenced corporations, with staff owning shares and using them to influence the direction of travel. The gig economy will be reined in with extra employment protections, he says. The privatisation of industries by Margaret Thatcher and John Major will be reversed, with workers given at least some control.To provide some intellectual ballast, the IPPR thinktank’s recent report on economic justice hammers home a message of hope around the re-emergence of the worker, back at the heart of corporate life.This is a conversation young people are having after years of being told they should be grateful to be employed at all.Young people, however, have very little influence at work: the baby-boomer generation runs things. Now 54 years old or more, its members started out as workers and might even have belonged to a trade union. They cared about their pay and how their boss behaved. But then they switched to consumption as a route to status: they are now primarily property owners, pension savers or pension receivers.Before any angry baby-boomers declare that they are still union members and care deeply about their colleagues’ pay and conditions – or that they put their personal finances second to considerations like the environment – it is clear they are in the minority. There are so many indicators that the majority of their peers – fearful of the future, determined to maintain their living standards – put their wealth before the workplace that there isn’t space to discuss them all.That is why May can get away with ignoring her pledge to put workers on boards – it is obvious there are not as many votes in it as her advisers thought.And if there were a groundswell of opinion in favour, it is neutered by a lack of faith in today’s trade unions, most of which are far more concerned with internal Labour politics than with addressing the declining terms and conditions of their members.Industrial action – last week’s equal pay strike in Scotland aside – is taken almost exclusively to protect pension entitlements. Unfortunately, the most experienced and better-off workers are still too busy shopping and saving to confront the boss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07fbbbefb3b7aed37fb623ec9fe15dfa67a762f8/0_23_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0df0d430100bbc3f0aa27dd36e36f88","title":"cate blanchett straight talking approach to complicated issue","story":"The Hollywood star is right to defend the notion that actors need not necessarily be like the characters they portrayCate Blanchett is so good at playing lesbians that even when her character is not explicitly written as a lesbian, it is possible to suspend enough disbelief to decide that, well, maybe, Lou in Ocean’s 8, just may be.At the Rome film festival, she spoke about the growing noise around the idea that straight actors should not play gay characters on screen. Around this year’s Oscars, the Advocate reported that 52 straight actors have been nominated for Academy Awards for gay roles. Actors have often spoken of the stigma around being “openly” gay when it comes to getting parts. This discussion became something of a roar in August, with the “backlash against” (or “row around”, depending on where you saw it) Jack Whitehall voicing Disney’s first major gay character – although I once lost a month to reading essays on whether Elsa’s “special powers” in Frozen had a deeper subtext.Blanchett defended the idea that an actor need not necessarily be like the characters they play.“It also speaks to something that I’m quite passionate about in storytelling generally, but in film specifically, that film can be quite a literal medium. And I will fight to the death for the right to suspend disbelief and play roles beyond my experience,” she said. Having played Bob Dylan, an elf and an animated vigilante Viking who lives among dragons, her point seems valid. “We expect and only expect people to make a profound connection to a character when it’s close to their experience,” she added, suggesting that reality television might be partly responsible for a shift in our expectations of how storytelling should work. It amounts to a strange erosion of empathy.Not for the first time, I felt grateful for Blanchett, who gives off an air of someone who could hold a sensible discussion with a seahorse. She has had some opposition, but it’s disappointing and lacks nuance. Debates around this topic are complicated and complexity is rarely popular in a polarised age.Scarlett Johansson taking the role of a trans character when trans actors have been so vocal about finding it difficult to get work, even in trans roles, was thoughtless at best and it seemed right that she stepped down. It also seemed right that Blanchett should play the title role in Carol, say, a film directed, produced and written by queer people who chose to cast Blanchett in the story they were telling. Actors are part of the storytelling machine, of course, but it’s misguided to see them as the entirety of it.Mary Beard, not to be confused with Mary Berry, who did not write Women and Power – and thank you to the man from the bookshop who pointed this out when I asked him where a copy of it was – has planted her flag in the “firmly against” camp when it comes to the inhuman practice of historical re-enactments in documentaries.She said there will be “no drama reconstructions in any programme made by me no B-list actors dressed up in sheets, saying, ‘Do pass the grapes, Marcus’.”Reconstructions often ruin documentaries in my view, so I am with Beard, though my bugbear is more specific. While I can see the practical need to get actors to dress up as Tudors, for example – the 4G coverage in the 16th century was so poor that nobody could save their Snapchats – there is no excuse for Marcus to pretend to be passing the grapes in instances where there is plenty of footage of actual Marcus passing the actual grapes. Naturally, this being 2018, she has since apologised for the fuss. “Sincere apologies to all actors, struggling and otherwise (perhaps I shd say I was trying to rescue you from having to dress up in sheets and learn some dumb dialogue!),” she tweeted.In a column for the Washington Post, Caitlyn Jenner has formally taken back her support for Donald Trump, in response to the slow drip of legislative venom aimed at transgender people. “I believed I could work within the party and the Trump administration to shift the minds of those who most needed shifting,” wrote Jenner. “Sadly, I was wrong.”“You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me,” she said in an Instagram post directed at Trump, in 2017, after the administration rolled back legal protections of transgender school students. “You don’t give us equality and a fair shot I’m coming after you,” she told ABC News later that year.This “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed” rhetoric, as if the president of the United States had been caught bunking maths to smoke in the bus shelter, disappeared into the ether with all the impact of an odourless vape. The New York Times reported last week that the administration is considering “narrowly defining gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth”. It is outrageous, dehumanising and cruel and appears to have nudged Jenner into action.That she has only now fully acknowledged that it was a mistake to trust Trump doesn’t do much to quieten the criticism that her privilege cushioned her from harm enough to even consider voting for him in the first place, and it is endlessly infuriating that people can only see the extent of a problem when it has a direct impact on them. And yet, even in its “sadly”, it is honest. I can’t help but wonder if a formerly vocal Trump supporter explaining why she now believes that choice to have been wrong will have far more impact than a Democrat-supporting Barbra Streisand telling her Democrat-supporting fans to vote Democrat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07f1656bf6a8132ff6b9e7984de1aa0b9b6669d0/0_256_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad9e6777e35588a24074796274bfbbc","title":"megyn kelly nbc partisan divide","story":"The fact that 47-year-old woman did not already understand the history and harm of blackface justifies NBC parting ways with herFollowing Megyn Kelly’s latest demonstration of poor judgment and ignorance by condoning the wearing of blackface for Halloween, NBC is now set to part ways with her. And while Kelly’s departure might be shocking due to NBC’s massive investment in Kelly — a $23m annual salary and a coveted role on Today — it was seemingly inevitable.In early 2017, NBC News chief Andrew Lack hired Kelly from Fox News with the hope that she could appeal to conservative viewers without alienating their more liberal MSNBC viewers. And right from the start, Kelly’s desire to give voice to right-wing conspiracy theorists such as Alex Jones essentially foretold the sooner rather than later end of her NBC tenure.On its own, Kelly’s defense of wearing blackface on Tuesday’s episode of her show Megyn Kelly Today warrants the cancelling of her show, but it is also the final straw within her short and rocky tenure at NBC. Additionally, it represents a microcosm of her inadequacy as a bipartisan television personality.It is much easier to condone blackface when you have no black neighbors.Kelly grew up in a world without ersity and she still employs the lessons from her youth as a guide within an increasingly erse and racially equitable America. Kelly tacitly yearns for the simplicity of her homogenous white upbringing as a panacea against the complexity of an America with a growing chorus of non-white voices.This inclination makes her wholly inadequate to progressives, yet her conservative appeal has also fallen since she left Fox News. Kelly exists within a cultural, political, and journalistic no man’s land.Lack brought Kelly to NBC to bridge the partisan ide, yet despite her evident disdain for Trump she unintentionally espouses his isive philosophy albeit with a slightly more palatable façade.While it would be unfair to describe Kelly as a racist, the logical and emotional foundations of her stance on blackface bear greater resemblance to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” rhetoric than any other current political message. They both ache for a white dominated yesteryear where overt racism was not considered racism because America’s systemic racism had effectively silenced the voices, ignored the history, and marginalized the existence of the non-white Americans negatively impacted by these actions. One side thirsts for white supremacy and the other remains cosseted in the ignorance of non-white people and the systemic racism that buttresses their white homogeneity. Kelly is obviously the latter.On her Wednesday show Kelly issued a public apology and soon thereafter it was announced that she would not appear on her show for the rest of the week. Later in the day, Lack held a town hall meeting with NBC staff and denounced Kelly’s comments: “There is no other way to put this: I condemn those remarks there is no place on our air or in this workplace for them.”In Kelly’s internal and public apologies she stressed how via conversations with close friends and colleagues she has learned the error of her ways. Regardless of whether Kelly has or has not turned a corner, the fact that a 47-year-old woman did not already understand the history and harm of blackface means that she should no longer be considered an authority figure with the nous to inform and educate the public in our increasingly complex, tense and racially fraught climate.Kelly was supposed to help NBC appeal to Americans on the left and the right, but all she did was perpetuate the dangerous ignorance and anxiety many white Americans feel in an increasingly erse America. This misguided rhetoric only drives us further apart, so it only makes sense for Kelly and NBC to part ways too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb8010b32da42cc082c7b75ac70f34b321cc0587/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca3305d66c6255830896e34a879ca2ba","title":"danny dyer james bond philomena cunk explains culture","story":"As the famed thinker prepares to publish her first encyclopedia of everything ever, she pontificates on Mozart, Norbit and moreDanny Dyer is probably the greatest actor of his generation. Born Danial Dandy Dan D Dyer on his birthday in 1977, he rose to fame. His first big film appearance was as one half of the title role in Human Traffic. But he is probably best known for his tear-breaking performance as landlord Mick Carter in the never-ending TV drama EastEnders. Dyer brings his tremendous sensitivity and range to his work. In the epic romantic film Run for Your Wife, he brings everything you’d expect to the character of John Smith. And when he appeared as Danny Dyer in Who Do You Think You Are?, critics praised the moving scenes in which he discovered that he had ancestors. He is also known as a fiercely outspoken commentator, and has famously suggested that cocaine is an excellent reward for a job well done, that cutting your ex’s face is a good way of getting over her and that breaking Mark Kermode’s nose is a good way of getting over him. He should definitely be the next James Bond.Games of Throne is an epic and exciting programme on the television and computers and your phone which is based on the play King Lord of the Rings by William Shakespeare. It’s set in sort of series one Black Adder times, before dragons became extinct. It’s weird watching it because most of the time it’s like medieval Made in Chelsea or something, just all these people getting pissed off with each other and looking serious saying loads of made up stuff in old language. It’s so old-fashioned the script is probably given to them in the form of a tapestry. Then, just as you’re getting bored with them talking and talking and walking about and talking, they have a huge spectacular fight with some zombie monsters, or a dragon monster flies down and starts having a go at them and you think maybe it was worth sitting through all the talking and then it all starts again.You might think it’s for kids, like Harry Potter, because of the dragons, but the thing is it’s also got loads of tits in it, so you know it’s grown-up. If there’s one thing you can say about tits, it’s that they’re not for babies. There’s so much tits in the programme it’s a bit like a hanging around in the ladies’ changing room of some historical re-enactment society. Some people say it’s gratuitous but I think it’s important to know women’s tits looked roughly the same in fictional medieval times as they do now. They must have spent ages researching it, but it’s good that someone was that thorough. It shows. One of the main characters is called Jon Snow, but before he did the news. When he was younger he was this tortured soldier man with really nice hair, which is quite an achievement when you think about how hard it must be to maintain a half-decent male grooming regime by candlelight in a violent fantasy realm when you’re constantly being distracted by dragons and tits.Games of Throne doesn’t just tell the story of Jon Snow off the news when he was in medieval fantastic times, it does that for loads of people. It’s mainly British actors you’ve seen in Midsomer Murders and Morse and that, but what they were doing before, when there were dragons. So it’s quite educational. If you were doing a history degree at University about what the suspects in Midsomer Murders were doing when they were goblins, it’d be a great way to revise. The show is so popular, that that’ll probably be a round on University Challenge one day, or a one-off special, with Jeremy Paxman in a smock.Of all the composers who have ever lived, none has written quite as many tunes as Wolfgang Rock Me “Amadeus” Mozart. Mozart was born in 1756 in Austria, though it wasn’t called Austria then. By the age of three, he was playing the piano, though it wasn’t called the piano then. People thought he was the Prodigy, but the Prodigy wouldn’t be born for over 200 years, so he could go about his everyday composing business without people mistaking him for the angry one and asking him to play Firestarter on the harpsichord, which left him more time to invent hit songs like The Marriage of Fig Roll and Concerto No 21, which he did. Little Tiny Mozart wrote his first tunes aged five, and his first symphony aged eight. This is amazing, because he could have been out on his bike or climbing a tree like a normal kid. His parents sent Mozart and his sister out on tour around Europe performing their hits before the courts of Prague, Vienna, Paris, Munich and London. Why they did their tunes in court is a mystery, but probably because there were judges there, and they were hoping to get through to the judges’ houses, where they’d have a better chance of a record deal.By the time Mozart wrote his first opera at the age of 14, it was clear he wasn’t normal at all. For a start, he was 14 and could sit through an opera. Something had to be done. So he got a job as an organist. But that didn’t stop his compulsive tune-writing, and he just kept forcing more and more music out of himself, like he had the shits, but with notes. Eventually, poor and exhausted, he took to his bed to die. Even then, he couldn’t do it without music, so he wrote his most famous last work, the Requiem, which is a very long song in Latin about dying. It’s very much the East 17’s Stay Another Day of its day, and would have been on a John Lewis ad if Christmas had been invented back then. But he didn’t finish it, and it died along with him in 1791. He was 33, the same age as Guy Fawkes was when he died, leaving his greatest work – blowing up parliament – also unfinished.Films are a sort of television that’s longer than one television programme (say, Bargain Hunt) but not as long as watching all of, say, Bargain Hunt. Unlike normal television, films don’t come to your house if you’re not interested in them any more. You have to go and visit films where they live, which is this really big hot dog kiosk called a cinema. The hot dogs here are bigger and not as nice as the ones you can make at home using real sausages, so they take longer to eat. This means they have to give you somewhere to sit down, but because nobody likes watching strangers eat, they make all the seats face away from each other, and then, to give you something to look at, they put on a film. Here are some films that exist …Some men go to sea to chase after some barrels, probably because they think there might be beer in them. The twist is that hiding under the barrels is a shark who has learned that the men love barrels and is using them as bait. The clever shark tries to kill the men by exploding when they get near, but the men hide under the water and die, which is a lucky escape for everyone, except one of them, who luckily escapes.Four Weddings and a Funeral Hard-to-follow drama about posh people who have lots of things to go to in a row, but fortunately have loads of suits and frocks anyway, so nothing’s in the cleaners, and it’s not really a problem. Looked it up and apparently it’s actually three weddings and a funeral and then another wedding, which makes it a bit easier to follow.The Cannonball Run Only seen the end. Which was brilliant. On one side of the screen is a poem made out of people’s names, and on the other side of the screen is a sort of You’ve Been Framed with sex offenders. I should make clear I don’t know who any of them are in the clips, and they’re probably not sex offenders, but it was the 1970s and we’ve learned not to make assumptions.Citizen Kane Black and white.Nuns on the Run If you’ve seen The Sound of Music or Sister Act, you’ll know how annoying it is when a nun starts singing in a film, because it holds up the story, and the nun never gets to do a good bit like push Alan Rickman off a ledge or fight dinosaurs. This is an interesting film because it has no singing in it, but it also doesn’t have any good bits, so maybe it just proves that nuns and films don’t mix. A warning from God.Star Wars 2: Star Wars Strikes Back If you’ve seen the first one, The Star Wars Menace, this probably makes sense, but someone told me that one was hopeless, so fuck that, and I’ve gone straight in at what they say is the best one, and it’s not. For a start, Fozzie Bear is really old in this one, and doesn’t do any jokes, and they’ve given him Kermit’s face by mistake. So someone really isn’t paying attention. It ends really weird, with this Jeremy Kyle bit about who’s whose dad, and then he falls down a hole, and they catch him and that’s meant to be the end, even though they don’t say what happens to any of them. They should do one of those bits at the end they sometimes do with old photos and some words that say which ones went to prison and who died. That or outtakes, like in The Cannonball Run.The Braun Elegance Hair Straighteners Demonstration Video Seen this loads. Hard to talk about without spoilers, but well worth getting a copy. It’s never on at the cinema, but I found mine on video cassette down Barnardo’s. It’s my favourite film apart from Norbit.NorbitNo. Hang about. Not Norbit. I’m thinking of Big Momma’s House.

From an infantile infatuation with skeletons to a bah-humbug resentment of corporate marketing, I have now rejoined the wacky bandwagon (with the help of my young children) and wonder why I ever thought apple bobbing, pumpkin carving, tricks and treats were so bad. I have taken this rediscovered zeal pretty far today, with ghosts and gnarly monster’s feet, so do rein in the spook and shape these delicious treats in any way you like. And I wish you all a terribly terrifying night.I used a ghost-shaped cutter, but use any you have to hand, or none at all. If you do use one, you’ll have trimmings to dip in chocolate, which is no bad thing. The ghosts will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. 125g unsalted butter300g white mini marshmallows (or regular white marshmallows), roughly cut into 1.5cm pieces1 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp toasted sesame oil½ tsp flaked sea salt160g Rice Krispies 3 tbsp sesame seeds, lightly toasted125g plain or vanilla halva, roughly crumbledTo decorate (optional)80g white chocolate, cut into roughly 1cm pieces25g dark chocolate, cut into roughly 1cm piecesGrease and line the base and sides of a 24cm x 34cm swiss roll tin.Put the butter in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat and leave to bubble away until it smells nutty and has turned an amber colour – about seven minutes. Turn off the heat and immediately add the marshmallows, vanilla extract, sesame oil and salt, and stir continuously for about a minute, until completely melted and smooth. Stir in the Rice Krispies, sesame seeds and halva until everything is combined and all the cereal is coated in marshmallow.Spread out in the prepared tin and, using a spatula, press the mixture down and into the corners, then smooth the top. Leave to cool until set, about an hour, before stamping out into shapes with a cutter.To decorate the ghosts, put the white chocolate in a small, heatproof bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water and stir occasionally until almost completely melted but with some visible chunks (these will melt in the residual heat). Take the bowl off the pan and let the chocolate cool, stirring occasionally. Pour the melted chocolate into a small piping bag or sandwich bag. Repeat with the dark chocolate, so you end up with two chocolate-filled bags.Snip a tiny hole at the end of the white chocolate bag, and pipe zigzag lines across the ghosts, to look like bandages. Snip a tiny hole in the dark chocolate bag and pipe two small dots on each ghost face, for eyes. Leave to set at room temperature for about an hour, or for 10 minutes in the fridge.Making honeycomb can seem a bit daunting, especially if you have little experience of working with sugar, but as long as you read the recipe carefully and measure everything out beforehand, it isn’t really hard at all. The feet keep for up to five days at room temperature in an airtight container. 50g water60g runny honey110g glucose300g caster sugar1 tbsp bicarbonate of sodaTo decorate200g dark, milk or white chocolate20g flaked almonds andor pumpkin seeds, lightly toastedGrease and line the base and sides of a 30cm x 20cm high-sided baking tin. Have a metal whisk at the ready.Combine the water, honey, glucose and sugar in a large saucepan, and gently stir together with a heatproof spatula until just combined – do not stir too much, otherwise the sugar might crystallise. Put the pan on a medium-high heat, bring to a gentle boil, then cook without stirring for eight to 10 minutes, until light amber in colour and smelling prominently of honey. If the mix colours unevenly, gently and slowly swirl the pan in a circular motion.Take off the heat and immediately whisk in the bicarb until thoroughly combined. Take care when doing this, because the sugar mixture will bubble and rise up rapidly. Quickly but carefully pour the mixture into the prepared baking tin, letting the mix even out by itself – do not be tempted to spread it out, because this will cause the honeycomb to deflate. Leave to cool completely – about an hour.Use the tip of a knife to cut the honeycomb into roughly 6cm shards – do not use your hands, because the honeycomb will crumble.Break the chocolate into pieces and place in a small bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water. Stirring occasionally, leave the chocolate until it’s almost completely melted but with some visible chocolate chunks (they will melt in the residual heat). Take the bowl off the pan and let the chocolate cool down, stirring from time to time, until cool to the touch. Half-dip the honeycomb pieces in the chocolate, shaking off any excess. Stick five flaked almonds or pumpkin seeds along the shorter edge of the honeycomb, to look like toenails – then leave to set completely, about 30 minutes.Use Pink Lady apples for a more vibrant colour and tangy flavour, or ambrosia for a more custardy result. To save time, replace the crumbs with roasted, chopped salty nuts.For the pumpkin caramel200g caster sugar 150ml double cream, at room temperature60g unsalted butter, at room temperature and roughly chopped into 3cm cubes100g pumpkin puree¾ tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp flaked sea saltFor the rye crumbs25g unsalted butter2-3 slices rye sourdough, crusts removed, bread roughly crumbled (100g)35g soft light brown sugar¼ tsp ground ginger6 cardamom pods, shells discarded and seeds finely ground in a mortar¼ tsp flaked sea saltFor the apples6 Pink Lady or ambrosia apples30g unsalted butter, at room temperature30g soft light brown sugar90g soured cream, to serveHeat the oven to 165C330Fgas 3¼. Put a medium saucepan on a medium-high flame and, once hot, add a third of the caster sugar – it will begin to melt as soon as it hits the pan. Give it a stir and, once completely melted, add a third more and repeat. Repeat with the final third of sugar and cook until it has all turned amber – about four minutes. Off the heat, slowly whisk in the cream and butter – it will sputter as it emulsifies into the sauce. Return the pan to a medium-low heat and whisk in the pumpkin, cinnamon and salt until completely smooth – about two minutes – then set aside.For the crumbs, melt the butter in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Add the bread and sugar, and cook, stirring continuously, for six minutes, until they begin to take on some colour. Add the spices and salt, lower the heat to medium, and cook for six minutes, until deeply golden and slightly crisp. Spread out on a baking tray and leave to cool.Core the apples, then put them in a deep, 28cm x 18cm baking dish.Put the butter and sugar in a small saucepan on a medium-high heat and cook, stirring often, for about three minutes, until smooth. Pour over the apples and bake: 30 minutes if using Pink Lady 45-50 minutes for ambrosia. You want the apples to be soft and cooked through, but still retain their shape.Return the caramel to a medium-high heat and warm for a few minutes. Divide the apples and their liquid between six plates. Pour caramel into the centre of each apple, top with a spoon of soured cream then the crumbs, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73a8db52733bb708ea14d941958f476420e5d74/1131_307_4843_2906/master/4843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce45050eaf3a0d7e3717c01528ec237f","title":"andy cole manchester united interview kidney transplant","story":"The former Manchester United and Newcastle striker on the ‘torture’ that followed his lifesaving kidney transplant, his feud with Teddy Sheringham and his hopes for the future“I’m not ungrateful because I get to live another day,” Andy Cole says as he shivers and pulls on his coat. A cold wind gusts through the sunlit garden where we sit in Alderley Edge. Fifteen miles from Old Trafford, which the former striker still thinks of as the Theatre of Dreams, it’s just me, Cole and an emptying pot of tea. As a Manchester United player who won five league titles, the Champions League and three FA Cups, including the treble in 1999, Cole lived a fantasy life for years, even if his wounded quietness gave the wrong impression that he was surly.Yet when the 47-year-old says, “I’m never going to be the inidual I was before”, Cole is not mourning the end of his career. His lament about the “internal battle” and “torture”, which has deepened his depression and made him consider taking his own life, is rooted in ill health.Cole has accepted for the last decade that his footballing days are long gone, confined to flickering memories which provide a gloss to the solid statistics confirming he is third on the list of scorers in Premier League history, behind only Alan Shearer and Wayne Rooney. He is also 12th on the all-time list of assists – primarily when playing for Manchester United or as a shy hero at Newcastle.That surgical battle might have been won but the larger war has consumed him. “I was depressed after the transplant because it’s very tough to understand the trauma you still face. I remember emptying a big bag of medication and just crying and thinking, ‘For me to survive another day, this is what I’ve got to take. For the rest of my life. I’m not sure I can continue.’“I’m still struggling emotionally. Physically I’m also struggling. No two days are the same and the medication means you’re up and down. I would never wish this on anybody because it’s a very telling experience. It brings destruction to your family life as well.”We spend 90 minutes together and Cole is a revelation in talking so openly, and with such gritty detail, about his post-transplant life. Unlike an ordinary interview with a former sportsman, Cole does not have a book or a product to plug. He is not on a mission to spread any educational message or offer an upbeat mantra about how life is now lit with serenity and hope.Cole just wants to talk so that he can “put it all out there”. He also wants to say sorry to everyone he has hurt. His family, and in particular his wife, Shirley, have suffered from all his doubts and blues. “I apologise now to everybody for being the way I’ve been. What I was doing, torturing myself over an illness, is horrible. You push them away because you’re trying to quantify what’s gone on. Eighteen months since the transplant, I know it’s a lifetime illness.”The surgical procedure of transplanting a kidney is less complicated than the post-operative battle against rejection. “Don’t forget my new kidney is a foreign object. My body attacks it. So I have to take these anti-rejection drugs to stop my body winning. People say, ‘Stay positive.’ But you never know how long your kidney will last. It could be here for five or 10 years. It could fail tomorrow. Each day you go into the unknown.Has it taken a toll on his marriage? “Massive. It pushes everything to the brink. Before, I would watch people who are depressed and suicidal and not really understand. Now I’m in the same position. Depression kicks in, you have suicidal thoughts. They understand it more than most but I’ve pushed my family to the brink. Me not telling them exactly how I feel has made this past year the toughest I’ve had.Listening to a middle-aged man open up so graphically is moving – especially when it is a former Premier League footballer who once shut himself off from the world because he felt judged. “I’ve always been quiet, and people can look on quietness as a weakness,” Cole says, considering his media image. “It’s like Raheem Sterling today. What they do to him they did to me. Some of the comments people make about you, not even knowing you, that’s the most upsetting thing about football. In my case, it’s often been, ‘He’s arrogant, difficult.’ But then people get to know you. They turn around and say, ‘You’re not like that.’”Cole does not labour the point but, as with Sterling, the suspicion lurks that racism underpins these stereotypes. His father emigrated from Jamaica to England, ending up in Nottingham, in the 1960s. “My dad never really spoke about it but when he first came over, and tried to find lodgings, he saw signs saying, ‘No blacks. No Irish. No dogs.’”After a couple of loan spells he was signed by Bristol City but, after less than a season, Newcastle broke their transfer record and signed him for £1.5m in February 1993. Cole scored a dozen goals in 12 matches to help the side, under Kevin Keegan, sweep into the Premier League. The following season he scored 32 league goals in a devastating partnership with Peter Beardsley and became a St James’ Park favourite.“It was absolutely frightening,” Cole says. “I really struggled to embrace the adulation because that’s not my bag. Even now, I struggle with adulation. I’m getting inducted into Newcastle’s hall of fame next month. Obviously I’m going to try enjoy it but it was just my job to score goals. The adulation feels surreal.”“I soon realised what it was all about. Brian Kidd, the United coach, called me over. He said: ‘Coley, if you think 41 goals a season at this club is good enough, not a chance.’ I looked at Kidd, thinking, ‘He’s got two heads, this fellow.’ But I soon understood there’s more to playing for United than scoring goals. At Newcastle I was just expected to score goals. But at Old Trafford I became a better all-round footballer.”What was it like playing for Sir Alex Ferguson? “Tough. But then I got to like him. I don’t mind managers who have a go at me if that brings the best out of me. Working with Sir Alex was an eye-opening experience. He was fantastic and the only manager I’ve ever come across who could manage different generations. But the way he spoke to us then would definitely not work now. The power is with the players now. But he was the only manager who could get the best out of me. He understood me as a person and even with the Teddy Sheringham thing he was fantastic. He mentioned it to me once and then let it go.”Cole and Sheringham were infamous for never speaking to each other despite forging a highly effective partnership up front. Cole was upset by Sheringham snubbing him as he ran on the field to make his England debut as a substitute in 1995 and never forgave him. He was close instead to Dwight Yorke and they terrorised defences in England and Europe – particularly in 1999 when United won the treble.From such career highs it was hard for Cole 18 years later on the morning of his transplant. “I had a lot of fear. All my concerns were with my family. I was thinking, ‘I’m not going to be here. So let me try to put everything in place before I’m gone.’ I was lucky my nephew was so kind giving up his kidney. They took a kidney from Alexander first and when they came for me I didn’t want to go. It really hit me. My wife was walking me down. I kept saying to her, ‘I’m not sure.’ Walking to the theatre was going into the unknown.“All I remember then is waking up with tubes up my nose. And them saying, ‘It’s a very good kidney, a big one.’ Within a few days you’re passing water properly, you’re getting better.”Cole speaks warmly of his close bond with his nephew. We also talk about, in his own words, “the upsetting trials and tribulations” that have affected his two favourite clubs, Manchester United and Newcastle, recently. But football matters little when it is set against real life.He had been close to tears an hour earlier but Cole seems stronger – if typically candid. “I’ve absolutely hated being ill. Everyone says you shouldn’t feel like that but you think, ‘Shit, I’ve let so many people down.’ But talking about it is my release.”In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

This 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth was their seventh of the season, their 28th goal conceded in the league and another day when Slavisa Jokanovic looks increasingly like a manager guessing his way through the season.David Bowie famously sometimes used the ‘cut-up’ technique to compose lyrics, cutting up phrases then piecing them back together at random. There is an element of that to Jokanovic’s team selection: this game saw him use his the 10th different defence and Sergio Rico replaced Marcus Bettinelli in goal, making Rico their third keeper used in 10 games. It’s worth noting none of the changes have been due to injury.Bournemouth, on the other hand, stride on. There’s nothing unexpected about their victories these days, and this was no exception. At no stage did they look in any trouble, a brace from Callum Wilson and one from the thrilling David Brooks more than enough for Eddie Howe’s composed and exciting side.Fulham looked nervous in the opening exchanges, like someone doing their best to impress a set of intimidating in-laws, but went behind in the 14th minute. Callum Wilson was clumsily knocked over in the box by Timothy Fosu-Mensah and rolled the penalty home himself.Fulham made a claim for their own spot-kick shortly afterwards, but referee Andre Marriner spotted that Aboubakar Kamara had very much gone down under his own steam, and duly booked him. Perhaps Kamara’s desperation to create something – anything – was a reflection of Fulham’s state of mind. He, André Schürrle and Aleksandar Mitrovic darted around, gamely attempting to find a hole in the Bournemouth defence, but no gap could be found.The closest they came to a goal in the first-half was a Denis Odoi header that flashed wide of the near post, and the mood of the crowd reflected the state of things on the pitch. A few boos were heard by the 20th minute, and when a fourth cross from deep was shanked well out of play the vibe downshifted to despondent.Bournemouth, on the other hand, were in a much sparkier mood. They patiently probed when they had the ball and earnestly hassled when they didn’t. The implausibly young and skinny-looking Brooks belied his age and girth, standing out once again. But Jefferson Lerma looked like the team’s leader, a solid presence at the base of midfield who geed up his colleagues when they briefly looked slightly flat.After the break, Simon Francis tested the extent of Rico’s agility with a rocket from way out, punched away by Fulham’s latest goalkeeper. The one concern for Bournemouth at that stage was a slight lack of urgency, the vague sense they thought another goal would come along soon enough, regardless of how hard they pressed for it.On the hour mark, Jokanovic brought on Tom Cairney, so badly missed in the month he has spent out with an ankle issue. But while he introduced a little wit to Fulham’s midfield, he couldn’t do anything about a calamitous couple of minutes that confirmed Bournemouth’s win.Adam Smith whipped the ball off Jean Michaël Seri’s toes, fed the squat, busy Ryan Fraser who in turn slid a beautifully weighted pass through to Brooks. The young Welshman barely broke stride in nutmegging Rico for his third goal of a seriously impressive nascent Premier League career. Brooks was on his way to another when Kevin McDonald tripped him, and with his sending off went any loose hope of a Fulham recovery. Wilson killed that off entirely with four minutes left, slamming home with extreme prejudice when a huge chasm opened in the Fulham defence. Many home fans got up to leave, discouraged by the prospect of a long season ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9147630320641814331360d0de8625a48991af/0_79_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a868b996f592596359295512dbb31c7","title":"liverpool cardiff city premier league match report","story":"There was a shock at Anfield as Cardiff City became the first opposition team to score a Premier League goal against Liverpool for 918 minutes. Otherwise, Jürgen Klopp’s team returned to the top of the table as a matter of routine convincingly and without challenge. Neil Warnock was correct in his assertion that a Cardiff win here was impossible.Mohamed Salah scored his 51st goal in 66 appearances for Liverpool and also provided two assists, for Xherdan Shaqiri and Sadio Mané, as the hosts cruised to the Premier League summit. Mané struck twice while Callum Paterson’s consolation for the visitors spoiled Alisson’s aims of a seventh clean sheet this term.Salah’s 33rd goal in 35 Anfield appearances stemmed from his alertness and the visitors’ failure to deal with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low cross from the right. The right-back’s delivery, having been teed up by Salah initially, was intercepted awkwardly by Sol Bamba who could only ert the ball into the path of Mané. His shot on the turn was blocked by Sean Morrison, Georginio Wijnaldum’s effort from the rebound was erted across goal by Bamba and Salah reacted quickest to convert from close range with Morrison and Bruno Ecuele Manga floundering on the line.Anfield sat back to enjoy the procession and captain for the day Virgil van Dijk almost obliged with a towering header from a Salah cross that kissed the far post before goalkeeper Neil Etheridge collected. But the procession took a while to materialise. True, Liverpool’s authority in the first half was almost absolute and at times it appeared Van Dijk and Dejan Lovren were passing the ball via Alisson just to keep their goalkeeper occupied. Roberto Firmino even managed to prevent a corner with a back-heel nutmeg – somehow while lying on the ground – while the body language of Cardiff’s forward players suggested they had taken Warnock’s comment about the impossible victory too literally. At least their defenders managed to give the impression that this was a contest and not a training exercise.Etheridge was quick out of his box to deny Salah and Adam Lallana in quick succession when a Bamba mistake allowed Mané to release his fellow forward through on goal. Salah went down under a slight touch from Morrison when Alexander-Arnold played the keeper’s clearance back into the penalty area but referee Stuart Attwell was unmoved by the penalty appeals. Lallana thought he had doubled Liverpool’s lead in first-half stoppage time with a header from Alberto Moreno’s deep cross but Morrison was well placed to clear off the line.Cardiff did work themselves into promising situations either side of the interval but lacked the quality and awareness to make the final ball count. They fell further behind when Firmino and Moreno combined to release Mané inside the area and both Manga and Víctor Camarasa made only lame attempts to challenge. The Senegal international punished their lethargy with a sweeping shot beyond Etheridge and into the far corner.Remarkably, and completely out of context with the flow of the game, the visitors ended Liverpool’s and Alisson’s proud record of clean sheets in the league at Anfield this season when Callum Paterson reduced the deficit with 13 minutes remaining. Junior Hoilett’s low cross from the right deflected into the striker’s path off Van Dijk and Paterson gave Alisson no chance by prodding the ball home from close range. It was the first time Liverpool had conceded a Premier League goal at home for 918 minutes, since Michail Antonio netted for West Ham United in February. There would be no comeback.Shaqiri, surprisingly dropped from the starting lineup for the anonymous Lallana, injected greater urgency into Liverpool’s performance and converted a fine third late on. Fabinho released Salah down the right, he picked out Shaqiri inside the area and the substitute cut inside two Cardiff defenders before stroking a calm finish inside the far post.Liverpool’s fourth was equally impressive, with Salah again the provider. Collecting Mané’s pass deep inside the Cardiff half he read the striker’s mazy run to perfection and pierced the defence with a perfectly weighted ball that Mané clipped over the advancing Etheridge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55b52a6e76baec88f903472c9097137f8cf5b5d/9_0_3243_1946/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eba3cee2dca32ae0a6171b7806b3bf3d","title":"watford huddersfield town premier league match report","story":"Roberto Pereyra, Gerard Deulofeu and Isaac Success fired Watford to a 3-0 Premier League win over Huddersfield to secure the Hornets’ best-ever start to a top-flight campaign.Watford now boast 19 points from 10 games – bettering their 17 at the same stage of the 1982-83 campaign, where they finished second.Javi Gracia’s men coasted through this clash in truth, with Huddersfield always game but ultimately outclassed at Vicarage Road.Now winless in 10 this term, the Terriers’ were at times bystanders as their worst start to a top-flight campaign deepened still further.Watford were able to bypass the visiting midfield at will, leaving the hard-working but limited Huddersfield needing either a huge change of luck, January reinforcements – or both – to avoid relegation.Watford strolled into total control of this match inside 20 minutes, Argentina star Pereyra striking first for his fifth league goal of the campaign.Pereyra capped a fine jinking run with an outrageous shoulder-drop dummy to bamboozle the visiting defence – before slotting past the helpless Jonas Lössl to open the scoring.Deulofeu then doubled the hosts’ advantage with another eye-catching finish, albeit amid further shoddy defending.The Spaniard fooled Chris Löwe all too easily – the Terriers defender far too quick to slide in – ghosted past Jonathan Hogg and then lashed home in style.Löwe’s long-range drive forced Ben Foster into a top-drawer save, tipping onto the bar, as Huddersfield finally threatened.Philip Billing saw another fine drive tipped over, and then Laurent Depoitre headed well wide from a corner when he should have hit the target as a minimum.Deulofeu should have heaped the misery on Huddersfield after the break, but instead chipped wide with the goal at his mercy. The midfielder latched onto Isaac Success’s defence-splintering pass, evaded the onrushing Lössl only to dink wide at the last.The second half meandered along with precious little incident until Success tapped in Watford’s third at the death to seal a training-ground ruse.After feinting to lump a free-kick into the box, Watford cut back to Étienne Capoue, who chipped over the top for Kiko Femenía on the inside-right.And when Femenía drilled in a low cross, Success tapped home under zero pressure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19fef5269d56f895405ecfcc772b8cb5af6a7113/0_54_1879_1127/master/1879.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f08e49adf2a3e58745f0d388e6f81c69","title":"leicester v west ham premier league live","story":"5 min: Maddison hits this one deep.

The striker came off at Arsenal ill, but yesterday posted a picture of himself training, claiming he is fully fit, on some social media site or other. Spat ahoy! Spat ahoy? Best ask the manager. “Of course the player wants to start. But I have to manage the player. We have three games in a week and need to manage all the squad.

Which admittedly doesn’t sell it very well, but this could be a doozy. There hasn’t been a scoreless draw between these clubs since 2004 since then, they’ve met 12 times, averaging just over three goals a match. It’s on!The hosts will still be smarting from defeat at Arsenal, who scored three very pretty goals against them at the Emirates on Monday night. Thing is, though, on another night Claude Puel’s men could easily have beaten the Gunners away for the first time since 1973 they took the lead, should have had a penalty, and hit the crossbar. So now the sting of defeat has passed, they shouldn’t be too disheartened.West Ham meanwhile narrowly lost to Tottenham Hotspur. And there’s no shame in that. It’s been a mixed bag for the Hammers on the road this season dispatched with ease at Liverpool and Arsenal, quite magnificent at Everton. They’ve also got a home win over Manchester United notched on their belt. And they won at the King Power last May. So while they’re closer to the bottom than the top right now, they won’t be too down on themselves either.All of which promises much. So with that said, if this match ends goalless, this MBM accepts no responsibility and denies all accusations.

They must take place in solid structures with a permanent roof if they are to be solemnised legally.There is an increasing demand for such services, which are permitted in Scotland, where couples have long enjoyed greater freedom over where they can proclaim their vows.The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is expected to announce in the budget on Monday that he wants to simplify the rules around wedding venues and reduce anachronistic red tape.“While the laws around who can get married have evolved substantially in recent years, the laws on how and where marriages must take place have remained largely unchanged since 1836,” a Treasury spokesperson said. “This review will help the law keep pace with modern Britain, while helping people keep the cost of living down.”The government is to ask the Law Commission to assess the legislation on wedding venues, with a focus on continuing to ensure the dignity of marriage ceremonies is preserved.The independent body said in a 2015 review that marriage laws were badly in need of reform and that there was a strong demand for weddings to be cheap and personal. It also said existing laws were already being stretched to allow more residential ceremonies.The Treasury spokesman also said the existing regulations put small business owners off applying for licences, driving up the cost of weddings and restricting choice. The expected changes would mean more couples would be able to tie the knot in hotels, restaurants and pubs. Licences to hold weddings are only provided for specific rooms, with food and alcoholic drinks not allowed to be sold or consumed in that area an hour before and during the proceedings.The cost of getting married has risen significantly in recent years. The average wedding now costs now between £20,000 and £30,000, including about £4,500 for venue hire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabfd018dee0b2c47e9b96bd316ab88f3dfc7c42/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0221c1f91d4ae4885b00017fef9892ee","title":"how the world smiles secret to collective happiness helen russell","story":"Optimism is more necessary than ever, and understanding how other cultures approach life’s trials and joys may help us achieve contentmentIf you read the paper or look at the news online without becoming depressed about the state of humanity – or make it through your social media feeds before your mood lurches to despair – well done you. You are a beautiful anomaly. For everyone else: huddle in. It’s tough out there and it can be easy to get the idea that the world is getting more miserable by the minute, that we’re all becoming more isolationist and that these are bleak times indeed. Because when things are ticking along nicely, there’s very little to report. Negativity bias means that, as human beings, we experience “bad” events more intensely than we do the “good” – and we also remember them more. So we have to work hard to remain hopeful – or we can’t make things better.Optimism isn’t frivolous: it’s necessary. If we feel hopeless all the time, if we’re always in crisis, the natural response is to give up and stop trying altogether. But we can’t let snark or apathy win. We can be aware of the bad whilst being mindful of how we can make it better. And there are people all around the world finding meaning and happiness every day, both in countries that top the global happiness surveys and in those that don’t.Since I started researching what constitutes happiness in different countries, I’ve been inspired by testimonies about the unique cultural concepts that constitute “a good life”. Of course, definitions of “happiness” vary and metrics to measure contentment also differ. Thailand, for example, has been ranked the least miserable country out of 66 economies for the fourth year running in Bloomberg’s Misery Index. The UN World Happiness Report for 2018 put the Nordic nations in the top four slots as usual, based on healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.Canada, America’s more socially liberal neighbour, has ranked among the happiest nations since the report was first published in 2012, thanks to a generous helping of joie de vivre – especially in Quebec, the French-speaking province. Quebeckers are so happy that were Quebec a nation, it would be second only to Denmark in international rankings (when tasked with explaining why, Quebeckers proffer something along the lines of: “It’s because we’re French, but you know, not France French.” What other nation would describe an orgasm as “a little death”?).Canadians also have a good welfare state and an outdoorsy lifestyle, but what sets them apart from similar cultures is an emphasis on inclusiveness. Multiculturalism is regularly cited as one of Canada’s biggest achievements and the ability to celebrate difference is a distinguishing feature. The Canadian mindset has been heavily influenced by First Nation ideas of equality and instead of crushing aboriginal values, Canada embraced them. Canadians cottoned on to the idea that we’re all richer from a plurality of voices – and that opening up your social circle to welcome in new people and celebrate ersity is a pretty good life plan.There’s also a wealth of ideas from countries that don’t feature on any official lists. Brazil, the country of carnival, football and nuts, has a word for the absence of happiness: saudade, used to describe the feeling of longing for happiness that once was. The term was popularised in the 15th century when Portuguese ships sailed to Africa and Asia and those left behind felt the loss of loved ones. The Portuguese colonised Brazil in the 16th century and the word was taken up by settlers to remember the homeland they’d left behind – a concept now so celebrated in Brazil that it has its own day, on 30 January each year.Researchers from the University of New South Wales have found that accepting and allowing for temporary sadness in this way helps improve attention to detail, increases perseverance, promotes generosity and makes us appreciate what we’ve got. Saudade teaches us that a degree of melancholy in life is inevitable – desirable, even – and something to be savoured rather than ignored. No one can be carnival-happy all the time and the lows help us appreciate the highs.The Thai concept of mai pen rai, or “it doesn’t matter, don’t worry”, reminds us to maintain perspective. Hyperbole is so widespread in today’s society – especially on social media – that if we don’t “love” something it’s assumed we must “hate” it. Only real life isn’t like that. There are myriad shades of grey that we’d all do well to acknowledge before galloping to outrage. A mai pen rai approach dictates that instead of striving all the time for more, the way we live life now is good enough and that “walking the middle ground” is the route to happiness, a theory upheld by researchers from the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. Rest is important, too. Dolce far niente – or the sweetness of doing nothing – is a much treasured concept in Italy that’s seldom spoken out loud but is often hashtagged on Instagram, accompanying pictures of Italians in hammocks. Italy doesn’t top any happiness rankings, but the cliché of the carefree Italian exists with good reason. Italians do “nothing” like no other nation and perfecting the art takes style and skill. It’s watching the world go by over coffee and gelato. It’s laughing at tourists. Or politicians. It’s savouring the moment and really enjoying the present.In Turkey, keyif – or the pursuit of idle pleasure – keeps locals sane and sanguine in turbulent times. Inactivity feels like an act of transgression for many in Europe where the Protestant work ethic is alive and well and held up as a goal for all. And yet when we make time to rest, we have the energy and the reserves to partake in civic debatewash the cardeal with a tax return.Another wellspring for a happy life worldwide is resilience – proven to increase immunity and reduce stress. The unofficial motto for Icelanders and wannabe Vikings everywhere – Þetta reddast – roughly translates as “it will be all right” and has come to represent the unwavering belief that everything will work out in the end. Since Icelanders have made their home in such an inhospitable landscape, it’s a belief that helps them score highly on happiness polls even in sub-zero temperatures.In India, meanwhile, jugaad – meaning frugal innovation, a “hack”, or an attitude and commitment to getting things done, no matter how – has long helped Indians make the best of what they’ve got in hugely challenging circumstances.Some of the themes that emerged while researching my book were universal – such as time with family and friends, having a hobby, taking the pressure off at work, or engaging with nature – but others were more profound. The Bantu term ubuntu means “I find my worth in you and you find your worth in me”, a sense of interconnection and the belief in a bond or sharing that connects all humanity. Bantu is spoken in Central Africa, Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes region, but ubuntu has been claimed by South Africa as a humanitarian objective to live by. In the 1990s, it became a guiding light for the anti-apartheid movement and even appears in South Africa’s Interim Constitution.Nelson Mandela led with ubuntu and it drove archbishop Desmond Tutu’s work as chairman of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Ubuntu urges us to care more, asserting that to be happy, we have to make sure others are, too. Even the people we don’t know. Even when it hurts. As Tutu said: “I am sorry to say that suffering is not optional.” So forget Descartes’ “I think therefore I am,” it’s time for a new philosophical bumper sticker: “I am because you are.” Rested and resilient, with our compassion levels restored, we can take action and make things better for everyone. That way, we’ll all be happier – long term. The Atlas of Happiness by Helen Russell is published by Two Roads at £16.99 on 1 November.

Jimi Famurewa reportsThe British pub may be a byword for hospitality – roaring fires, inviting booths, glinting bottles – but it’s a welcome that has not always extended to immigrants. From the “colour bars” of the 1950s and 60s to the Essex pub landlord who, earlier this year, refused to remove an array of ornamental golliwogs from his establishment, ethnic minorities have, historically speaking, had good reason to approach this bastion of British culture warily.But there is another, lesser-heard story about pubs and the BAME community. Ever since 1965 – when Oliver “George” Berry took over Brixton’s Coach \u0026amp Horses pub and became London’s first black licensee – non-white Brits have been taking control of the spaces from which they were once excluded, often transforming them into vital cultural hubs in the process.Today, this tradition continues with Jamaican-run bars, rural gastropubs under the stewardship of African-born chefs and the Desi pubs of the Midlands which serve delicious Punjabi cooking to buck the general downturn in the trade.It’s even getting the sitcom treatment, in the form of Romesh Ranganathan’s The Reluctant Landlord, inspired by his Sri Lankan family’s time running a Sussex pub, which starts on Sky1 this week.So what are the unique challenges these landlords and landladies face? How do they balance the demands of thirsty students and first-generation immigrants looking for a taste of home? Here, five publicans share the view from behind the bar.This was the first pub I worked in, doing Sunday shifts in the early 1980s because a friend of my family drank here. It was owned by an African man called Nelson. He was one of the people who led the trend around here for black people to want to own pubs. He showed that it was achievable. If you’d just come here from Jamaica, the Golden Anchor was a place you could come in, meet family and friends, and maybe get work in the building trade. On the other hand, I remember walking into pubs in Bermondsey at that time and being the only black person there.By 1998, Nelson had passed away and the new landlords, who were Jamaican, were looking for someone to take over as the licensee. When I started, there were drug boys who effectively ran the pub it was why the other people had given it up. They would be getting their clients in here, not buying drinks. It wasn’t nice at all, but I had to front them out, little me against those boys. My brother helped me and, with some prayers, we got rid of them.Our Caribbean food and music is a big reason people come here. And if we stopped the dominoes, there’d be trouble. We had to move the game from one room to another recently, and the men who play created such a fuss, threatening a boycott. They’ve been playing here for more than 20 years: we know what they’re going to drink, how hot they like their soup. They see it as home, and when they’re dancing on a Saturday night to our DJs, that makes me happy.In all the time I’ve been here, we were never “a Caribbean pub” or “a Jamaican pub” in my mind. It was only when I heard people referring to us that way that I realised it was how people viewed us. But we can’t run this place for one group of people.Obviously the area has changed and, from late 2016 until May last year, we had a pop-up bar in the basement, Little Nan’s Tropical Den, offering kitsch decorations and serving cocktails in teacups. There are young white people who love the food, know what they want and what it should taste like.It’s important to me that they know they’re welcome, that we’re not just a black pub. Everyone is welcome.In 1993, I was 32, selling tools at the market and drinking here. The landlord at the time had fallen out with the brewery and decided to leave. One of the barmen said I should go for it, so I went to Weston-super-Mare to do a British Institute of Innkeeping course, interviewed with Holden’s Brewery and got the tenancy not long after. It was hard work at first. There was a barman who was stealing from me, but I kept him on long enough that he could show me how a cellar worked, teach me about cask beers and what have you.When I took over, there was no food at all it was a watering hole. But when the smoking ban came in, it killed the pub – trade dropped by about three grand a week – so a lot of the Desi pubs started opening kitchens. We started with tandoori chicken from a tent in the yard in 2003 and escalated to a proper chef in 2007. Now everybody wants to eat Indian food. It makes me laugh because when I used to work as an attendant at the swimming baths when I was 19, people would go, “Eurgh, you smell of garlic!”In the old days, we would get people coming to the pub and trying to intimidate us. I can’t say whether it was about race, but we dealt with it ourselves. If they wanted it, we gave it to them. It was like a cowboy film you don’t get the sheriff, you just carry on punching.These days, because of the food, my clientele has changed from a strong Asian base to a strong white British base. Sometimes I’ll bar an English fella for not behaving and he’ll say, “You’re racist.” But this is a business. It’s not somewhere you come and mess about. In its time, the pub has welcomed young, old, Irish, black, Asian. The stigma of racism has gone in Smethwick. And we Asian landlords bear no grudges.Before taking over here in late 2015, I could probably count the number of pubs I had been into on one hand. I’m originally from Nigeria, but I moved here to study and met my English partner. My background was in business, but I did culinary courses and, in 2011, started a business called Kidderminster Catering. I started looking for cheffing jobs, but they tend to mean working evenings and weekends, and I wanted to be there for my kids, who are now 11 and eight. That was when the pub came up, and I thought it was a fantastic way to showcase my food while also being together as a family.We live in the pub, so I haven’t needed babysitters. The children like being able to grab sweets and drinks from the bar. And my daughter gave the customers a laugh once when she came down in her pyjamas, thinking we were closed.At first, running the pub was challenging. We decided to open on New Year’s Eve 2015, which I now know is the worst time. Oh, my God. Before we even opened the door, there were people queueing on the main road and everything that could go wrong went wrong. The draught line stopped working, 200 people were waiting to be served, the tills broke. In the end, we just stopped charging people. It was a disaster, but I learned from it. If my front of house walked out tomorrow, I could clean my own draught lines, and tell you how a pint of beer should taste.This is an affluent, rural, white area, so I’m probably the only black person in town. But food offers common ground. People who would never have gone into an African-Caribbean restaurant come in here. There are people who a year ago would have said, “The thought of eating goat makes me want to puke.” Now, they’re sucking goat juices out of the bone and asking for really hot spice. That makes me so happy.I don’t forget my African history or where I come from. I’ve had people come in and say something racist, so I’ve given them some facts about black history. My husband always says, “If anyone wants to say anything bad about black people, she’ll have your head on a plate.” One guy was talking about immigrants, saying they just claim benefits and so on. I told him, “You can leave now.” I actually had to drag him out. People think that because you’re a woman or you’re black, they can walk all over you. No way.I came to this country from India in 2003 – as a student of public administration – and became a pub landlord in 2010. There was a lot of hard work in between. When I first arrived, I worked in an Asian supermarket during the day and a bar at night. Some days, I would work for almost 20 hours. The best way to stay awake was to not drink alcohol. Energy drinks, coffee – I don’t like those things.I think it was around 2008 that I decided I wanted to start a business, become a shopkeeper or something like that. But when I looked at it, I decided a pub would be easier and I liked the concept of Indian food in a British-style pub.In 2012, I started the play area – the Paw Ways – because it was very hard for me to bring families back to the pub. Some regulars weren’t happy with it, but I told them, “This is my pub now and I’m going to do what I want with it.” It’s got fibreglass animals – giraffes, dinosaurs, a crocodile – that I went to Devon to collect myself. I’ll keep on adding as many as I can.In our trade now, the biggest problem is staffing. It’s hard to find and keep good chefs because a lot of Indian people in the area are now buying pubs. They think it’s a money-growing tree, but it’s not. They don’t see the pain behind the story.If I’m paying my chef £300 and somebody says to him, “I’ll pay you £350 if you come to me”, then he’s gone and that’s a big problem.But I’ve got a good team and I’m proud of myself. I came to this country with no English and now I’m running a pub.This place used to be a music venue, and I remember when we first came to look around in 2014, the estate agent warned us that it was in a bad state. I thought, how bad could it be? But my God, it was disgusting. It smelled of puke and God knows what else the toilet was smashed to bits.It made sense to make the Caribbean aspect of the bar – the food, the music – our unique selling point. I didn’t want to go into any areas I wasn’t familiar with. Caribbeans aren’t really big on ales, so we don’t sell them. We focus on cocktails and rum instead. Another thing we brought in was our “Rastaman” mannequin. It was originally a statue of a blond-haired surfer guy that we asked a company to turn into a rasta he basically just looks like a white guy with a tan. Some students stole him one night and another idiot punched his arm off, but he’s still standing, just about.We’re not tied to a brewery or company, so I think we’re the first independent, black-owned bar in Sheffield. I’m only 25, but I’ve grown into being a landlord.There are strange moments, though. We’ve had customers come in who have assumed that one of my white staff members is the owner. On the other hand, I’ve had some black customers say, “Oh, there are too many white people here.” My response is always, why does it make a difference? We get a good mixture of white British people and Caribbean people, and we try to balance both.I also want to use Blues to start a black enterprise scheme. I got the taste for running my own business when I opened a cafe as part of my business and accounting degree. I had grown up with lots of moneymaking schemes – making beats and selling them to people, hiring my bedroom out as a studio. But as a young black guy, you’re probably less likely to be given a loan from the bank to start a business. I want to use funds from special nights to give minority people in Sheffield that helping hand, whether it’s assistance with a business plan, DJing apprenticeships or even helping a young barber rent a chair in a barbershop. It’s important to me that this is a place that helps the culture and the community.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61efeff56e2a21897721fe049dbab54c01321aa/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78fa2d5ab1c0dc160d517717ccb7960c","title":"photojournalist steve mccurry a life in pictures","story":"A new book, Steve McCurry: A Life in Pictures, compiled by the photographer’s sister Bonnie McCurry, captures his iconic images, from his early work in the US to his journey into Afghanistan hidden among the mujahideen, coverage of the 1991 Gulf war and 911, and more recent work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a2754c044cfd54825e2771536be8c263827a34/19_0_1703_1022/master/1703.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a903998f1b86d5c95a7b4378056b6e6","title":"weinstein ex assistant ban workplace non disclosure agreements","story":"Zelda Perkins says debate over her ex-boss and Philip Green highlights need for changeHarvey Weinstein’s former assistant Zelda Perkins has called on the UK government to urgently ban the use of non-disclosure agreements in the workplace following the Sir Philip Green allegations.Perkins, the most high-profile example of an inidual breaking an NDA drawn up between lawyers and powerful clients over allegations of sexual harassment, said the debate surrounding Green highlighted the need for the agreements to be made illegal.Perkins claimed she had been prevented from speaking out after alleging sexual assault against the film producer. She had thought her only option was to sign an NDA.Perkins, who worked for Weinstein’s Miramax Films in London during the 1990s, claims Weinstein “sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a colleague of mine”.Green was named in parliament on Thursday as the leading businessman accused by the  of sexual and racial harassment. Peter Hain, who identified him in the Lords, said he was using parliamentary privilege to circumvent NDAs used “to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying”.Perkins has now called for NDAs to be made illegal when used to cover up any type of crime committed in the workplace.“In an employment environment there isn’t any reason, or any time, when they are acceptable,” she said. “I know people shout out that it protects the victim as well, but it only protects the victim because of the current climate. There shouldn’t be any shame or fear about calling out bad behaviour, but at the moment the environment is skewed to help the perpetrator.”The government is reportedly considering prohibiting NDAs about sexual harassment in the workplace, but Perkins called for the ban to be much wider.“It shouldn’t just be that NDAs are banned around sexual harassment, it’s about discrimination, it’s about race, environmental accidents, it’s about people in power.“This about a whole cultural, social attitude change. If you’re in a position of power, part of the deal that you make when you have a lot of power is that actually you should be acting more responsibly than anybody else. Historically it’s always been like this, once people become powerful they think they are above everything.”Green has “categorically and wholly” denied allegations of “unlawful sexual or racist behaviour”. Lawyers for Weinstein have said the film producer “categorically denies engaging in any non-consensual conduct or alleged threatening behaviour”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f45ce40f2c0766300f46de4461a9d6795ec716f1/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81ca0d594aeb96488d83559d6b7bca7","title":"were a nation of self storers but how safe is your stuff","story":"There are more than 1,500 self-storage sites in the UK – but a recent fire exposed how vulnerable customers areWhen Helen Chapman* was moving home but needed somewhere to store her possessions temporarily, she checked out the cost of facilities near her home in Tottenham, north London. On her doorstep was a two-storey warehouse owned by Safehouse Self-Storage, which offered a favourable deal to hold her items for eight weeks.On the evening of 18 September 2017, events took a dramatic and unexpected turn when the warehouse went up in flames in a blaze that was tackled by 140 firefighters and 25 engines. The disaster struck five weeks after the freelance chef had deposited 20 boxes in the 15 sq ft unit – and just days before she planned to collect them and bring them to her new flat.Nothing survived – Chapman had lost everything. The warehouse was sealed off and she was not even allowed to access the site so she could sift through the rubble.“I was devastated. The fire burned for 10 days and every morning when I woke up I could smell it. I am still so angry, as I had paid them to look after my stuff and keep it safe,” Chapman tells  Money.“I paid £140 for eight weeks, which included storage, insurance and a deposit, which I thought was a good deal. The next few weeks were horrendous as I gradually started remembering all the precious things in those boxes.”Chapman bought only “a quite minimal” level of insurance, which meant the payout was far below the value of her goods.But the Safehouse fire has exposed how vulnerable consumers are when things go wrong – unless they have taken out “belt and braces” insurance – and how the sector is (surprisingly, in the light of the Grenfell Tower fire) subject to only light-touch regulation.Most of the large storage companies, such as Shurgard, Access and Big Yellow, require customers to take out insurance. Shurgard, for example, says they should take out at least £2,000-worth of cover, at a cost of £12 a month, rising to £45 a month for £15,000-worth.The cheapest option is to first contact your existing home insurance provider, which is likely to extend your cover to items outside the home for a short period, often at little or no extra cost.There are also stand-alone policies, such as those at Surewise, which charges £9 for two months’ cover for goods worth up to £2,500.Many people using storage companies take only minimum cover, believing the risk to be small. But the sad stories of Safehouse customers – about 500 lost nearly everything – may prompt a rethink.Take, for example, Nadeem and Silvia and their family, who had recently moved back to the UK after 20 years in Italy. They had put almost everything they owned in the storage unit while looking for a new house and business premises. All their belongings perished.Another family, between house moves, lost the contents of their three-bedroom home, including irreplaceable war service medals.Stella Whalley, an artist who had a unit at Safehouse for many years, lost “a lifetime’s work” with an approximate value of more than £90,000. She says: “It has taken me a long time to recover mentally from this and I have had to leave my home in London and work abroad as I can’t afford to rent a studio there.”A music producer and manager of an Emmy-winning band, who was using storing overspill from his office, had master tapes, platinum discs and memorabilia destroyed.Among Chapman’s lost items were her prized Le Creuset pans, owned by her late grandmother – which helped trigger her passion for cookery – as well as family jewellery, including her grandmother’s wedding ring from her 73-year marriage. “I did not take out a high enough level of insurance because it was a very temporary situation which I thought was low risk,” she says. “I believed my goods would be safe, with 24-hour security etc.“I actually felt safer knowing they were being protected in Safehouse than with me and therefore not so vulnerable to burglary. The derisory amount offered by the insurer is insignificant in comparison to the true value of the things I lost.”Safehouse, a less well-known storage chain, is understood to be a family business. It apologised to its customers on its website for “a colossal and intense blaze that has completely devastated the site” and told them the contents of its storage units “should be considered completely destroyed”. Money was unable to reach Safehouse by telephone and the company did not reply to emails. It was not a member of the Self Storage Association UK, which advises all self-storage customers to insure their goods for their full replacement value. Most communication between Safehouse clients was via WhatsApp.“Some of us stood outside for days crying and demanding answers,” Chapman says. “That’s how we met and formed an action group.”They organised a crowdfunding drive to raise money for legal advice. But this week they were told the chances of a successful outcome were slim.* Not her real name"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a4169c42169b569336919f015a210ed0841c38/0_1286_7625_4572/master/7625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b84b460cf181d875f16cf59080599af","title":"one to watch zuzu liverpool pop","story":"With her electrifying unpredictability, the sci-fi-loving singer-songwriter could be the future of Liverpool popCilla Black. Sonia. Sporty Spice. Heidi from the Sugababes. While pop was made in Liverpool’s image, there have been scant female voices carrying forth its lineage. That’s one reason why 23-year-old Zuzu – no other names offered – is so captivating. “I don’t speak the language nor the tong-guh,” she sings on All Good, her scouse accent flying as proudly as Courtney Barnett’s Australian brogue does in her songs. Like Barnett, Zuzu excels at the kind of guitar music that shifts easily from hangdog to heroism, though she has a stronger inclination towards pop – her choruses tend to light up like a match dropped in a box of fireworks. Beauty Queen, in particular, has that electrifying Taylor Swift thing.A sci-fi enthusiast, Zuzu’s songwriting is littered with space references. Dark Blue, a rich, slumping rock song, starts out maudlin but vaults into an unexpectedly euphoric chorus about shared self-pitying tendencies: “Just like everybody else on the planet, we just fell from the sky and act as if we found it,” she sings. It’s the lead single from her next EP, which she’s self-recording despite signing to Virgin earlier this year.Zuzu learned her craft as a lonely kid, filling time: she also directs her videos, makes comics and promises a Cardi B cover and Christmas single before the year’s up.

The amendment, if passed, will state that acceptance of the prime minister’s deal must be dependent on a public vote taking place beforehand, in which people would be offered the choice of leaving on the terms of that deal, or staying in the EU.The group, led by the Tory MP and former GP Sarah Wollaston, is determined to maintain the momentum from last weekend’s march through London by 700,000 people in favour of a people’s vote, by showing remainers that MPs in all the main parties are prepared to fight for them in parliament.Wollaston is working with a team of two other GPs – the Tory MP Phillip Lee and Labour’s Paul Williams – and the SNP’s Philippa Whitford, who is a surgeon. They are particularly concerned by the effect Brexit will have on the NHS but warn it will also be a catastrophe for the economy and jobs.They believe the move has the backing of more than 100 MPs, and that they have a chance of pushing the amendment through if the Labour leadership shifts position and whips its MPs in favour of a second vote.A senior Labour figure who backs the move said: “There are some supporters of a second referendum who think the main push should come later, amid the chaos that would ensue from May’s deal failing to get through parliament or a no-deal. But we believe a killer amendment like this could be our only chance. We cannot afford to miss it.”The prospect of such a vote will increase the pressure on the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who would prefer a general election to a second vote. A majority of his party members and activists want a second referendum, and most would prefer to stay in the EU rather than accept a poor Brexit deal.Wollaston, who spoke at the “people’s vote” march, said: “Without a second referendum vote on the final deal there is no informed consent to Brexit. The consequences will last for generations. Valid consent requires the government to set out the final version of Brexit and allow people to weigh up the risks and benefits.“Quite simply Brexit will be bad for health, science and the economy in ways that will touch all our lives. As a group of four current and former clinicians we feel that the principle of informed consent is as important when it comes to Brexit as it is to patients when weighing up the pros and cons of surgery.“People must have the right to look at the final plans, the evidence about consequences and have the opportunity to change their minds.”Williams said: “Before politicians make the biggest leap that this country will make in all of our lifetimes, we should check with people to make sure this is really, really what they want to do. We now know so much more than we did in 2016. Companies are stopping investments in the UK. NHS staff are leaving because they don’t feel welcome. Medical research collaboration with Europe is ending.“Our country will become poorer, have less influence and have less control with the type of Brexit deal that Theresa May is agreeing. Is this really a price worth paying?”Senior ministers confronted the prime minister last week over their suspicions that No 10 will agree a deal that they could never accept. At a stormy cabinet meeting on Tuesday, May was told there must now be the “closest possible political supervision” of the Brexit negotiations.Ministers demanded a full cabinet discussion, including an assessment by the chief whip, Julian Smith, and a legal ruling by attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, before Britain signs anything. The so-called “Irish backstop”, demanded by the EU and agreed to by May last year, would at the very least keep Northern Ireland tied into the EU’s customs and standards rules.Ireland’s EU commissioner, Phil Hogan, told May there was no chance the EU would back down on the issue. “Nobody should be in any doubt about the unity of the EU to ensure that the commitment to an operational backstop on the island of Ireland is honoured and included in the withdrawal agreement so that a hard border on the island of Ireland is avoided,” he told the Observer.In a hair-raising rundown of planning for a no-deal Brexit, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, told colleagues he was looking at whether trade could be rerouted through Dutch and Belgian ports should the French take a “tough stance”. He said Britain was highly dependent on the Channel tunnel and said the private sector should “think creatively” to help solve the capacity problem at UK ports.On aviation, it was pointed out that while companies such as Ryanair could move their headquarters to keep planes flying between EU destinations, this was “not an option for British Airways”. It was also announced that the government was about to tender for warehouse space to store crucial medicines.Leaders of the SNP, the Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats met the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels last week. In an article written after the talks, Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid’s leader at Westminster, and the Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said one message had been that Labour was now the main obstacle to another referendum.At its party conference earlier this month Labour said it would push for a general election in the event of Brexit chaos, but another referendum was an option if it could not force one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3172b0cdf9f3728f882e8008a8ac70279a1f3a3/446_22_4395_2637/master/4395.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7407a486f1fce485ed04ff5cb3b24f39","title":"mega mission mars ancient life nasa rovers sample return","story":"American rocket engineers are being urged to push their next Mars mission to the limits of technological performance. Space scientists have told Nasa they want the agency to “dream big” to ensure their new robot rover, scheduled for launch in 2020, visits a maximum number of sites to increase chances of uncovering signs of ancient life on Mars.Rock samples – hopefully bearing fossils – would then be left in caches on the Martian surface, to be collected several years later and returned to Earth in a complex series of robot “sample return” missions costing more than $10bn.For this investment, the scientific community says it wants to have the strongest possible chance of finding signs of ancient Martian life – hence its call for the next robot rover to the red planet to visit the largest possible number of places where it can collect rocks, hopefully rich in fossils. However, it acknowledges this mission will push the robot vehicle to the very limits of its performance.“The community prefers a mega-mission,” said Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology, quoted in Nature this month. “If we are going to do a sample return, it has to be a sample cache for the ages.”The planet today has almost no atmosphere, no liquid water, and its surface is bombarded by intense radiation. “We now think the likelihood of life existing on its surface is slim to non-existent,” said Matthew Golombek, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.So Nasa’s next Mars mission has been designed to answer the query: was there ever life on Mars?US scientists are concentrating on rocks formed in watery environments billions of years ago, when the planet was much more Earthlike. These rocks, as they formed, would have preserved remnants of any life that flourished before the planet’s atmosphere evaporated and its surface water boiled off.It will be the task of the next, as yet unnamed, Mars rover to drill into promising sediments, collect samples and place them in test tubes that will then be dumped in caches. The original proposal was to create one cache but, at a meeting this month, scientists pressed for several to be created.Three sites close to each other were pinpointed as being particularly promising andwere voted as favourites among scientists at the meeting in Glendale, California: these are known as Jezero crater, Northeast Syrtis and Midway. Jezero and Midway are thought to be most useful. However, the two sites are 17 miles apart. Nasa’s most advanced robot, Curiosity – a sister craft to the forthcoming rover – has travelled only 12 miles since it landed in 2012. “Creating two caches at Jezero and Midway would push our technology to the very limits,” Golombek admitted. “On the other hand, we need to make sure we get the best possible samples. We are going to have to work hard on this.”Around 2026, Nasa plans to launch a follow-up mission that would land a rocket launcher and new robot craft, called Fetch Rover, on Mars. Fetch Rover will gather up the caches and deliver them back to the rocket, which will then blast the samples into orbit round Mars. There it will rendezvous with an orbiter to carry the samples back to Earth.“We will have the strictest quarantine conditions enforced when we collect and store those samples,” said Golombek. “It will be worth the effort and expense, however. This is going to be our best chance of finding out if life evolved independently on another world and that life here is not just a lucky accident.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925a19bf5b7aac5b9660f48ae6e19680c5d70e5d/300_0_2677_1607/master/2677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca8104b7508332b156ee1286fdec9cd3","title":"england new zealand rugby league match report","story":"• England 18-16 New Zealand• Gildart scores magnificent late try on England debutOliver Gildart’s late try ensured victory for England in the opening Test against New Zealand in Hull, following a pulsating affair which suggests the remainder of this three-match series will be thoroughly compelling.Gildart, a late inclusion in Wayne Bennett’s squad due to an injury to Sam Burgess, ensured his England debut would be an occasion to remember, as he scored a magnificent solo try which ultimately proved to be the difference in a fantastic advert for international rugby league.New Zealand had led on several occasions earlier in the contest, including twice in the second half, when penalties from the boot of Shaun Johnson had put the Kiwis in control. Gildart, however, had the final say as England drew first blood, with victory at Anfield next Sunday ensuring a series win for the hosts with a game to spare.Without 12 players from the squad that reached the World Cup final, this series offered Bennett an opportunity to provide a glimpse into the future for the national side – and Gildart, as well as several others, certainly showed the future is bright for England.England led as early as the fourth minute when Sam Tomkins – making his first appearance for the national side since 2014 – finished a fine move to open the scoring. The Kiwis battled back commendably though, with tries from Esan Marsters and Dallin Watene-Zelezniak put the tourists 12-6 ahead.The New Zealand captain would be involved in a pivotal moment as half-time approached though, as the full-back’s tackle on Jake Connor while the Hull man crossed the line was deemed to be dangerous, resulting in a penalty try that levelled matters at 12-12 at half-time.Johnson twice kicked the Kiwis back ahead after the break – with Connor responding with a penalty goal of his own on 55 minutes - and for large periods of the second half, it looked as though those goals would prove to be the difference. Gildart, however, would produce the game’s decisive moment with 14 minutes remaining when he raced away to ensure victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f25c1cc213553bcb3726c6bfc995fb2a1a937ecf/18_0_4577_2747/master/4577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e931b7158c54a813039dbc2ddaf9009","title":"sri lanka v england t20 international live","story":"3rd over: Sri Lanka 16-2 (Chandimal 7, de Silva 0) Denly has figures of 2-0-5-2, and a career IT20 bowling average of 4.66.Another wicket for Joe Denly! Dickwella charges down the wicket, plays for non-existent spin and is bowled. The ball skidded on to hit off stump. “England have found their mystery spinner!” says Mahela Jayawardene. “He doesn’t spin it!”2nd over: Sri Lanka 13-1 (Dickwella 3, Chandimal 5) Tom Curran almost strikes with his first delivery. Dickwella pulled him to square leg, where Hales swooped forward to take the catch at ground level. His muted celebration suggested he wasn’t certain it had carried cleanly, and so the umpires went upstairs. The soft signal was not out and, as ever in these cases, there wasn’t enough evidence for the third umpire to overturn the decision. There’s another referral later in the over, this time for a run-out. The non-striker Dickwella was home and the ball deflected off the stumps to the boundary, so Chandimal gets four bonus runs.Joe Denly strikes with the last ball of the first over! Kusal Mendis tried to slog sweep a flighted delivery that skidded on to hit the stumps. He missed a straight one, essentially, but who cares. That’s a lovely moment for Denly, who is playing his first international match since 2010.20th over: England 187-8 (Plunkett 7, Jordan 2) England edged, scampered and thumped 10 runs from the last over. That’s a decent effort, especially after the damage done by Malinga in the previous over, and it means Sri Lanka need 188 to win.Rashid drags the penultimate delivery of the innings back onto the stumps.19th over: England 177-7 (Rashid 0, Plunkett 4) Plunkett digs out the hat-trick ball, an excellent yorker from Malinga, and blasts the next delivery down the ground for four. That was a brilliant over from Malinga - six runs, two wickets - and he ends with figures of two for 30.Two in two balls for Malinga! Stokes is cleaned up by a low full toss and smacks his bat against his pad in frustration. He struggled to get going and made 26 from 27 balls. Malinga is on a hat-trick.Malinga is too good for Denly, who holes out to long on to end a useful innings of 20 from 17 balls.18th over: England 171-5 (Stokes 26, Denly 18) Udana replaces Malinga, whose last over is being saved. He also has an impressive collection of slower balls and restricts Stokes and Denly to six singles in the over. Superbly bowled.17th over: England 165-5 (Stokes 23, Denly 15) After a slow start to his innings, Denly relieves some pressure by thumping Dhananjaya back over his head for four. That’s the first of three boundaries in four balls from Denly, an emphatic response to his trial by Malinga in the previous over.16th over: England 152-5 (Stokes 22, Denly 3) Denly is hoodwinked by a magnificent slower full toss from Malinga that dips late and just misses the off stump. That’s the start of a brilliant over, full of the usual variations. He bowled four consecutive dot balls to Denly, who could barely lay bat on ball, before England scampered a single off each of the last two deliveries.15th over: England 150-5 (Stokes 21, Denly 2) The new batsman Joe Denly gets off the mark with a single from his first ball. Amid the chaos and the rain, England are just about on course for 200.Moeen’s breezy innings ends when he misses a mow across the line at Dhananjaya de Silva. It was a lovely little cameo of 27 from 11 balls.14th over: England 141-4 (Stokes 18, Ali 23) The captain Thisara Perera comes into the attack. Stokes top-edges a pull shot that goes high in the air and lands just short of third man. Then Moeen, who looks in great touch, belts Perera for consecutive sixes. The first was a sweetly timed pick up over square leg, the second a lusty clout to cow corner. Moeen’s elegant savagery has brought 23 from nine balls.13th over: England 126-4 (Stokes 17, Ali 9) Remember when batsmen used to play themselves in? Roy hit his second ball for six today and Moeen has done the same to his third, driving Sandakan lazily for six. Sandakan, the left-arm wrist spinner, ends with figures of one for 39 from his four overs.12th over: England 116-4 (Stokes 15, Ali 1) The ambidextrous spinner Kamindu Mendis bowls the last four balls of the over he began before the rain delay. With two left-handers at the crease, he is bowling just right-arm offspin for the time being. England milk three singles from those four deliveries.The players are back out on the field. We’re in serious danger of seeing some more cricket.Play will resume at 4.30pm It’s stopped raining and the covers are coming off. We haven’t lost any overs either. Glory be!All hail Virat “If I may be allowed to chip in on the matter of Virat Kohli, he was not someone liked by people around the world,” writes OB Jato. “He was talented, but he used too many expletives, was too impulsive, and a touch too aggressive. His wristwork was good, but his technical flaws were laid out in England. Now, his technique has changed, his attitude has changed, and the respect people have for him has increased beyond anyone’s, perhaps even his, imagination. Instead of being milestones, the hundreds he scores are just side-effects of the job at hand. He is the ultimate team player. His ODI average is above sixty, leaving most fans drooling and fellow players jealous, but they seem inevitable for a player like him at the same time. And every single cricket lover adores him for all that he has become. “Just as I write this, he proves my point. After scoring his 38th century, he does not even bother taking off his helmet. He just raised his bat, punched his partner’s glove, and signalled the dressing room to sit down, which they duly did. For him, the situation is what he wants to excel in. We could all take a leaf out of his textbook, and learn to live life like he does - being calm, striving for success in the most unlikely of situations, and having the willpower to improve all the time.”There’s no real change in the weather. It’s light rain, certainly by Sri Lankan standards, but the covers are still on and there are no plans for an inspection just yet.“While play is stopped in Sri Lanka, maybe it will be rational to move over to nearby India (through the telly, of course) and see Kohli possibly score his 38th century, his third on the trot?” says Abhijato Sensarma. “What a player he is! The chase itself is in a tense stage too, with Dhoni gone and the last specialist batting pair no longer at the crease. Another thriller is on the cards for the fans.”As I type, Kohli’s average in ODIs has just gone above 60. Sixty!I take it all back. Apparently the rain is starting to ease off, so we might have some more play sooner rather than later. Nobody knows anything.The rain is getting heavier, so I fear that might be it for the day. There’s still plenty of time left but that’s not much good if it pours down for the next couple of hours.11.2 overs: England 113-4 (Stokes 13, Ali 0) Stokes pulls Mendis for six and then the umpires decide the rain is too heavy. It’s not apocalyptic, however, so there is still a chance of more play. Let’s hope so because it’s been a memorably manic start to the match.Roy’s spectacular innings continues with consecutive sixes off Sandaka, a slog sweep followed by a thump down the ground that just clears the rope, but his luck finally runs out when he is dismissed in strange circumstances. Roy flashed at a wide googly from Sandaka which was taken by the keeper Dickwella. The umpire was unmoved until Dickwella jumped up and down in celebration, at which point he raised the finger to give Roy out. Roy, who seemed irritated by Dickwella’s role as wicketkeeper-batsman-umpire, reviewed the decision without success.Replays showed a slight bottom edge so it was the correct decision to give Roy out. Bbut I’m not sure what the umpire was playing at it was almost as if he was waiting for confirmation from Dickwella that Roy had edged it before giving the decision.10th over: England 89-3 (Roy 56, Stokes 3) Replays show Stokes would have been given out had Sri Lanka reviewed that LBW appeal. It has started to rain, though it’s fairly light at the moment so play will continue. Roy blasts Kamindu Mendis through the off side for four, heaves a full toss for six to reach an eventful half-century from 30 balls and is then dropped for the fourth time! That was a much tougher chance for Kusal Mendis on the run, though he probably should have taken it.9th over: England 74-3 (Roy 42, Stokes 2) Roy is dropped twice in Sandakan’s over, both absolute sitters. That’s extraordinary. The first was to the substitute Samarawickrama at midwicket, the second to Shanaka at long off. Roy heaved a six over midwicket in between the dropped catches, and then Stokes survived a very good LBW appeal after missing a sweep at a googly. I’m surprised Sri Lanka didn’t review that as it looked really close.8th over: England 65-3 (Roy 34, Stokes 1) The ambidextrous spinner Kamindu Mendis is going to bowl for the first time. He starts with some left-arm spin to the right-handed Roy, who takes a single off the first ball, and then switches to offspin for the left-handed Stokes. What the bloody blazes! It’s important for England to forget the novelty and the hoopla play the ball not the ambidextrous bowler. But they can manage only three singles from a very impressive first over. Mendis looks equally capable as a left-arm spinner and an offspinner. Look, both hands!7th over: England 62-3 (Roy 32, Stokes 0) Roy looks rattled, understandably enough, and needs to settle down quicksmart. England have lost three wickets for 21 in the last 23 balls.With the Powerplay over, the left-arm wrist spinner Lakshan Sandakan comes into the attack - and his second ball brings a wicket, albeit through a run out. Morgan mistimed a reverse sweep and was called through for a very dodgy single by Roy. He was miles short when Sandakan collected the throw from short third man, turned and threw down the stumps in one movement. Roy, though he has batted well, has played a big part in the dismissals of both Hales and Morgan.6th over: England 59-2 (Roy 30, Morgan 11) Morgan drives Aponso over mid-off for a one-bounce four. When he’s in form, he is exhilarating to watch.5th over: England 52-2 (Roy 27, Morgan 6) Malinga returns to the attack, and the in-form Morgan gets his first boundary with a beautiful piece of timing through extra cover.  “Hi Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Does Joe Denly’s presence in the side indicate a willingness of England’s part to turn back the clock?”Is this a precursor to a conversation about Ian Bell?Alex Hales has gone third ball. He missed a sweep at Aponso and was hit on the pad, prompting a huge appeal which was eventually given. I thought it might have been slipping past leg stump, and Hales was clearly angling for a review, but Jason Roy seemed to suggest he should suck it up. That was a mistake because replays showed it was missing leg stump by a long way. That’s a very poor decision.Buttler chips Aponso low towards extra cover, where Chandimal swoops forward to take a good catch. Buttler had looked in good nick, with three boundaries in his seven-ball 13. 3rd over: England 37-0 (Roy 27, Buttler 9) Isuru Udana, the left-arm seamer, drops a difficult return chance off his first delivery. Roy, duped by a slower ball, muscled it whence it came Udana stretched to his left in his follow-through but couldn’t hang on.Roy has another scare later in the over when the umpires refer an appeal for obstructing the field to the third umpire. He was more than halfway down the track when Buttler sent him back, and as he attempted to make his ground he unwittingly blocked the throw from Shanaka. As he did not change direction in an attempt to block the throw, he is rightly given not out. He celebrates the reprieve by driving the next delivery sweetly over long on for six. He played that with a golf swing.An eventful over concludes with another referral to the third umpire against Roy. This time it was for a catch on the off side, but replays confirmed it was a bump ball.2nd over: England 29-0 (Roy 20, Buttler 8) The left-arm spinner Amila Aponso shares the new ball and improves on Malinga by only conceding 13. Roy clumps the first ball back over his head for four and switch hits the second just over point for another boundary. Jos Buttler joins in with a stunning drive between mid off and extra cover for four. That could barely have been placed or timed better.1st over: England 16-0 (Roy 11, Buttler 4) A flying start from England, who take 16 from Lasith Malinga’s first over! Jason Roy swished the second ball over long off for a majestic six, and he and Jos Buttler added a boundary apiece later in the over. “Afternoon, Rob,” says Ian Copestake. “Will you allow me to address the white elephant in the room? Does an ambi. bowler have to announce to the umpire that he is switching from right-arm over to left-arm whatever?”Yes. You owe me five large for that information. The difference gets tacked onto the principal.It’s dry at the moment in Colombo, though there are some nasty clouds overhead. Kamindu Mendis has been included in the Sri Lankan side, while Joe Denly is back in the England team for the first time since 2010.Hello. Let’s be honest, Twenty20 is so 2020. That’s the year in which the next World T20 takes place, and for now England’s white-ball focus is almost entirely on next year’s 50-over World Cup.T20 internationals have been a bit of an afterthought since that unthinkable climax in Kolkata two years ago, when Carlos Brathwaite ransacked England’s hopes and dreams with four consecutive sixes in Ben Stokes’ final over. A one-off match against Sri Lanka won’t change that, but there is at least the chance to see a rare and special talent. Enough about Joe Denly’s recall to international cricket for the first time since 2010 (honk!) because the ambidextrous spinner Kamindu Mendis will make his international debut for Sri Lanka.There have been a few ambidextrous bowlers in international cricket before, but none, as far as I’m aware, who have switched on a regular basis. This match might go down in history after all. Or it might just rain all night.Play is scheduled to start at 2.30pm BST, with the toss at 2pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c95a0f0545e87b08760f315ceffa2f8ea5386c5a/298_310_3544_2126/master/3544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55950ad341f43c13a9ef17159389c51b","title":"50 best uk pubs sunday lunch craft beer history dog friendly","story":"The pub is a great British invention. Here, experts pick their favourites for Sunday lunch, picturesque settings, craft beer, history and more. All (but one) are child- and dog-friendlyFor those who prefer their views more landscaped than wild, this pub is next to Henley’s elegant Georgian bridge, at the point where Oxfordshire meets Berkshire. The river is placid, the ducks entertaining, the air clean, and sunsets and mist keep the view varied all year round. The Angel ought to be a snooty tourist trap but remains a proper pub, with proper ale – Brakspear is a true Oxfordshire classic. The pub even has its own moorings for people with boats – or you can just wear deck shoes and pretend.• theangelhenley, every day 11.30am -10pm (closes 7pm Sunday)Permanently moored at Hotwells, west of the city centre, this retired industrial vessel, built in 1936, is now one of Bristol’s brightest, airiest pubs, offering a view of the magnificent SS Great Britain across an expanse of water always teeming with activity. There’s a range of interesting local beers in cask and keg, with a particular emphasis on the reliably decent Bristol Beer Factory. Sit on a stool by the window and watch dinghies swoop and turn and water taxis glide by, while historic ships the Matthew and the Mayflower (not that one) make their rounds. And you may occasionally see a dog on a paddleboard.• grainbarge, noon-11pm (11.30pm Thu-Sat)Like many licensed premises in attractive settings, this old pub is now more hotel-restaurant, but at its heart remains a welcoming stone inn, decked out with nautical relics. It’s still fine to turn up in hiking boots and have a pint without eating, either on the terrace on a sunny day or at the bar next to the wood-burner (dining is more formal in the evening, with lighter fare at lunch). In the right weather, Babbacombe Bay does a passable impression of the Mediterranean, with the sea just the right shade of turquoise. Inland, the wooded slopes and red Devon sandstone are beautiful too. To stay the night is pricey, with rooms from £245.  • caryarms, noon-11pmPopular with hikers who huddle here to warm up and dry off (“Please Do Not Block the Fire As Others Around You Also Like to Feel the Heat”) the Crown is a no-nonsense pub with no-nonsense old-fashioned beer and warming, filling food. Looming over the plain stone building is Pen-y-Ghent, the smallest of the famous Three Peaks, but a wonder nonetheless, especially with the shadows of fast-moving clouds playing over its green-grey bulk, or snow on its sides.• crown-hotel, Mon-Fri noon-3pm, 6pm-11pm , Sat noon-11pm (10.30pm Sun)The view from this pub is dominated by the town’s castle, a relic of the Norman invasion. Beyond that is the steep wooded cut of the twisting Wye Valley: you can’t see it from the pub, but a short walk between pints will get you there. The Three Tuns is an old pub with a modern makeover that works rather well – it’s idiosyncratic and has friendly bar staff. There’s a line-up of solid ales from Wales and south-west England.• On Facebook, Mon-Fri noon-11pm, Sat-Sun 10.30am-11pmThe start of the Pennine Way, just outside the village of Edale, is only a short train journey from Manchester or Sheffield, but feels much further, offering a deep country atmosphere without too much effort. This pub makes a point of welcoming those with muddy feet and is surrounded by darkly looming but still manageable hills. The beer is supplied by Marston’s and its subsidiary brands (Wychwood, Banks’s) and tastes like heaven after an hour or two in sun, or rain. The beer garden is unusually lovely by English standards, too.• dorbiere, noon-11pm (Sun 10.30pm)Moors and oceans are great, but looking up the Tyne towards the city’s bowed bridges from this pub in Ouseburn is another kind of delight. It is especially exciting at sunset, as the Instagrammers and amateur photographers of north-east England have discovered – city lights gleaming against Miami Vice skies. The pub cleverly treads the fine line between craft beer hipness and down-to-earth backstreet local atmosphere (the ancient tables have Scottish \u0026amp Newcastle blue star logos). Imperial stouts and double IPAs sit alongside sessionable cask ales, aspirational street food alongside local meat pies.• On Facebook, 11am-11pm, Fri-Sat 10am-midnightThis old-fashioned harbourside pub sometimes feels ready to weigh anchor and set sail itself, thanks to nautical fixtures, maps and memorabilia. Views are of Porthgain’s picturesque working harbour, the Celtic sea, and hillsides dramatically strewn with the ruins of hoppers that once held crushed stone from nearby quarries, for road building. In summer, the green in front of the pub is packed with tourists and excited children, but out of season the pub is a warm, safe spot for watching waves break over the harbour wall.• sloop, 9.30am-10pm (midnight Fri-Sat)This part of Suffolk rolls away forever, with a sky that’s somehow bigger than anywhere else. The Harbour Inn, by the River Blyth among boat sheds and jetties, is a pub designed against flood: in the lower bar, power-points are on the ceiling, pints are passed down through a hatch, and the floors are tiled for the ease of sweeping away mud. In summer it’s the perfect spot for watching clean white clouds float over the marshes, while at night there’s the opposite of a view – blessed blackness, and muttering estuary winds that bring to mind the ghost stories of MR James.• harbourinnsouthwold, every day 11am-11pmThis is a rambling, cosy pub with two beer gardens, its own affiliated microbrewery, and a sigh-inducing view of Trevaunance Cove between cliffside stretches of the South West Coast Path. It somehow feels like a secret despite being a short stagger downhill from the centre of the village, and generally heaving with tourists, cyclists, and motorcyclists. For the best view, clamber up past the terrace to the cast-adrift higher beer garden. In foul weather, stare out at the gales, mist and mizzle until you’re drenched, then retreat to steam by the fire in the front bar.• driftwoodspars, 8am-11pm most nightsBy Jessica Boak and Ray Bailey, authors of 20th Century Pub, (Homewood Press, £16.99), available at .Bookshop for £14.61A stay here means interesting contemporary food, tastefully decorated bedrooms (doubles from £135 B\u0026ampB), and lots of great walks. It’s also near Llangorse Lake. The back bar is linked to two smallish dining rooms, with modern prints on bright blue and ochre walls, leather sofas and mixed stripped chairs around scrubbed tables. Choices for Sunday lunch include local beef or lamb with cauliflower cheese and yorkshire pudding (£16), or vegetarian Glamorgan sausages of girolle mushrooms and spring onions (£16). There are 18 well-chosen wines by the glass and carafe, a range of sherries, three local beers, and Welsh spirits and cocktails.• eatdrinksleep.ltd.uk, food noon-2.30pm, 6-9pmThis handsome old inn faces the green of this Teesdale village, where you can still see the original stocks.

Non-trad Sunday lunch options are miso-glazed pork belly with baby pak choi and sesame sauce (£15.95), and a vegetarian imam bayildi with couscous and fattoush salad (£11.95). There are local ales on hand pump, a dozen wines by the glass and farm cider.• asshetonarms, food noon-9pm (Fri and Sat 10pm, Sun 8pm)This pub and hotel has been run by the same family for years and the little bedrooms (doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB) are a perfect base for exploring the Scottish Borders, and the abbey ruins are only a few steps away. The bar has a mix of locals and visitors and serves Orkney Red Macgregor beer, a dozen wines by the glass and around 80 malt whiskies. The more formal restaurant needs to be booked: its beautifully presented food is much in demand: slow-cooked feather blade of beef with crispy haggis nuggets and mustard sauce (£17.25), or roast pumpkin with beetroot and mozzarella crumble (£13.95). There are seats in the garden and booklets of walks marked out by the Melrose Paths Group.• burtshotel, food noon-2pm, 6-9pmDespite its exceptional food, this pub has a proper public bar for those who simply want a drink and a chat. Here there’s a wood-burner, 20 wines by the glass (focusing on France’s Languedoc-Roussillon region), three changing real ales and cider made in the village. Other bars have white or dark beams, a mix of old wooden furniture on bare boards and another wood-burner the stylish restaurant must be booked in advance. Favourite Sunday dishes include guinea fowl with braised turnip and leek and sherry sauce (£20), and a vegetarian choice such as honey and thyme beetroot press with ricotta and spinach tortellini (£15). There are walks round the delightful village on the River Ouse, and further afield.  • cambscuisine, restaurant noon-2.30pm, 6.30-9pm (9.30pm Fri, Sat), Sun 12-8pm pub food noon-3pm, 6pm-11pmIn a fold of the Lythe Valley, this slate-roofed inn has been welcoming customers since the 16th century. It’s stylish yet relaxed, with a busy public bar where there are Barngates and Bowness ales, 15 wines (including champagne and prosecco) by the glass, malt whiskies and local damson gin. Two linked beamed rooms have an open log fire and a wood-burner, fresh flowers, candles and daily papers a separate restaurant is light and airy. Food is faultless with dishes that include roast lamb loin and braised shoulder with crispy haggis, onion purée and hotpot vegetables (£25.50), and veggie options such as beetroot gratin with wild mushroom and gruyère crust (£14.50). Windermere is nearby and walks from the pub are many. • the-punchbowl, food noon-4pm, 6-9pmThe lovely garden here has palm trees, a path leading to rock pools and seats overlooking St Michael’s Mount and the Lizard. Inside, there are seascapes on bold paintwork, antique chairs and deep sofas, an open fire and one huge window. Food is good up-to-date brasserie fare, and there are local Cornish ales, 14 wines by the glass or carafe and a fine choice of gins and vodkas. Sunday dishes include roast rib of Cornish beef with kale, beetroot, roast potatoes, yorkshire pudding and red wine gravy (£16), and a vegetarian choice such as mousseron and leek cannelloni.

The bare-boards restaurant has French windows opening on to a conservatory. The menu includes rack of lamb with dauphinois potatoes (£19.95), and a vegetarian dish such as couscous with aubergine, tomato and courgette ragout and grilled halloumi (£13.95). There are local Harveys ales plus guests, cider from down the road and 14 wines by the glass. Well-appointed bedrooms (doubles from £140 B\u0026ampB) have their own terrace, and there’s a holiday cottage to let. NT-owned Sissinghurst is close.• thethreechimneys, food noon-2.30pm, 6.30-9pmIn this immaculately kept country inn, the food cooked by the landlord is king – they grow their own vegetables, rear livestock and keep bees. The menu includes partridge ragout with currants, foraged ceps, white wine, pappardelle and pecorino (£16), and, for non-meat eaters, baked gnocchi with garlic, butternut squash and walnuts (£16). Locals pop in for a pint of Longdog Bunny Chaser or West Berkshire Good Old Boy, 10 wines by the glass and a farm cider. There are cushioned chairs around polished tables on terracotta tiles, a wood-burner and a delightful garden. Public footpaths lead from the car park, and Silchester Roman walls and Vyne House are close by.• thewellingtonarms, food noon-1.30pm, 6-8.30pm, Sun noon-3pmAs a civilised break from the A1, this inn is hard to beat: a former labourers’ cottage, with small and attractive bar rooms, a friendly atmosphere, dark beams and a log fire in a stone inglenook. There’s a beer named for the pub and 25 wines by the glass or carafe. Favourite Sunday lunch choices include local venison with dauphinois potatoes and red wine sauce (£22.50) with vegetarian dishes such as leek and potato pie with hazelnuts (£14.50). A shop sells the pub’s own jams and chutneys, plus takeaway meals. Outside is a terrace with big flowering pots and seats on the lawn. Bedrooms are in the main building and a Georgian property opposite (doubles from £120 B\u0026ampB). There are walks from the door, and Clipsham Yew Tree Avenue is a collection of 150 yew trees, some 200 years old.• theolivebranchpub, food noon-2.15pm, 6.30-9.30pm, Sun noon-2.45pm, 7-9pmBy Fiona Stapley, editor of the Good Pub Guide 2019 (Ebury Publishing, £15.99). Available at the  Bookshop for £13.75They like their cask beer at West Yorkshire’s first community-owned pub, which reopened in 2014. There are always six hand-pumps in the compact bar, offering beers that change as regularly as the weather in this part of the world (breweries include Nomadic and Wild Child). The pub also hosts beer tastings, meet-the-brewer nights and an annual harvest festival. During the 2015 flooding, the pub, sitting on higher land, acted as hub and hearth for those affected by the deluge. This is a well-pubbed part of the world, but the atmopshere and beers mark it out as special.• foxandgoose.org, Mon 2pm-midnight, Sun-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-2am Time has a habit of leaving its trace on village pubs and the Duke is no different. Originally built as a medieval hall house, it became an inn during the 17th century. Old beams can be seen above the bar, and the ghost name of a former brewery owner is just visible on an outside wall. Reopened with the help of what is obviously a very active community (volunteers also run the village shop), this is a lively place attracting drinkers, foodies and families with events including pizza nights, beer and food evenings and a general sense of a good time. Help yourself to dog biscuits if you bring your best friend.• thedukeofmarlborough, Wed-Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-6pmThe good people of Bamford thought big when saving their pub in 2013: they also took over an adjoining cafe and post office, so you can send a postcard, have a cup of tea and a scone and, when the sun is over the yardarm, into the pub you pop for a pint or two. Flagstones, bare stone walls, wooden beams and settles set the scene for the interior, and in the winter you can sip your beer by the log-burner. There is good robust, home-cooked food and a sense of belonging, and after a day walking in the Peak District, foamy Black Sheep bitter is an ideal contemplative pint. • anglers.rest, 11am-11pm (Sun 10.30pm)Opened as the Hope Beer House in the 1870s, this pub got its mock-Tudor panelling between the wars. In 2010, closure loomed, but locals clubbed together and bought the lease (adding the freehold in 2015). Now it’s an award-winning pub with two bars and a conservatory at the back. The mood is comfortable and cosy, with plenty of old photographs, thoughtful beers from the likes of Siren, Vibrant Forest and Magic Rock and a hum of conversation in the air – all of which demonstrates wherever there’s a lively community, hope is always present. • hopecarshalton, Mon-Sat noon-11pm, Sun 10.30pm. No childrenIn 2010, what was then the Bevendean pub was closed by the police due to a series of antisocial incidents, leaving this housing estate close to the South Downs and Brighton University without its hub. Four years later it reopened as the Bevy, after locals bought it and carried out essential works (the vicar spent a day sanding). The result is a bright, airy, chilled-out and chatty pub that is more than just a place for a pint and something to eat (breakfasts are very popular). There’s a cafe, meeting space for clubs and organisations, quizzes and music nights. The whole project is an example of how an urban pub in an unfashionable area can be saved. • thebevy, noon-11pmThis part of the world is made for thinking: the mountains of southern Snowdonia brood, while the slate mines of neighbouring Blaenau Ffestiniog are long silent. But at Y Pengwern (the Pengwern Arms) there is laughter, the clink of glasses full of copper-hued beer brewed in nearby Porthmadog, and the strum of guitars on music night. Seven years ago villagers bought the last pub in the village, which had been closed since 2009, and saved this former drovers’ inn, where Victorian writer George Borrow once had a few ales. The new kitchen uses as much local produce as possible. There are also rumours of a ghost, Martha, who once owned the pub. She can now rest easy. • ypengwern, Mon-Thu 6-11.30pm, Fri 5pm-midnight, Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-11.30pmThe beer at this stone-built pub in a beautiful fellside village doesn’t have to travel far – it’s made next door. Community ownership of Hesket Newmarket Brewery came first, in 1999, and it was only several years later that the villagers (including long-time regular Chris Bonington) clubbed together to buy the pub. There’s a real fire, black-and-white prints on the wall and mugs and jugs hanging from wooden beams. This is ale territory, with not a creme brûlée porter in sight, though American hops make an appearance in the Brim Fell IPA.• theoldcrownpub, Mon-Thu noon-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-10.30pmThe Rose \u0026amp Crown was taken under community ownership in 2013, the first of its kind in the north-east. Built in the 17th century, it’s a cosy little hideaway in a village close to Slaley Forest. The decor is traditional (settles, wooden beams and a solid bar), the beer from a variety of local breweries including Allendale and High House Farm (all cask beers come from within a 10-mile radius). The menu reflects the mixed tastes of a rural community, from black bean vegetable stir fry to a whale of a battered fish with chips. There’s a disused nuclear bunker close by, but the Rose \u0026amp Crown is a much more life-affirming attraction. • roseandcrownslaley, Mon-Thu and Sun noon-10.30pm, Fri and Sat noon-11pmIf there’s no one behind the bar when you arrive, chances are someone on your side will serve you, such is the fraternal nature of this compact village pub just outside Exeter. The community currently leases the pub and is raising funds to buy it outright as the building’s owner wants to sell. It would be a shame if it was lost, as it is a true community hub, hosting a book club, gin tastings, quizzes and bingo it’s also welcoming inside, with horse brasses, beams, a wood-burner and the kind of patterned carpet all village pubs aspire to. Three cask beers are available, as well as Sandford Cider, made in nearby Crediton. Here’s hoping the villagers meet their target.• stokecanoninn, Mon-Thu 11.30am-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Fri-Sun 11.30am-11pmRed brick, solid, implacable – the Red Lion has stood opposite the village green since the 18th century. In the early 1980s, then owner Whitbread decided to sell, and it was rumoured it would become a steakhouse – banishing any sense of localism. But the villagers rallied round and the UK’s first community-owned pub came into existence. Cricket is big in Preston, and the Red Lion is almost like a club house for the four teams that turn out in the summer. There are cosy log fires, darts, great food and, in early November, a fireworks display. No wonder it’s currently Camra North Hertfordshire’s Pub of the Year.• theredlionpreston, Mon-Fri noon-2.30pm, 5.30-11pm, Sat noon-3.30pm, 5.30-11pm Sun noon-3.30pm, 7-10.30pmBy Adrian Tierney-Jones, member of the British Guild of Beer WritersOn a limestone cliff overlooking the Jurassic coast, this was originally a pair of cottages and has only been a pub since 1793. It boasts a museum of stonemasonry and local fossils, and the big stone slabs used as beer garden tables make it feel like there’s been a pub here since the stone age. There’s no bar: you queue outside the scullery door. This is one of a handful of pubs to have made it into every single edition of Camra’s Good Beer Guide. • squareandcompasspub, summer noon-11pm, winter noon-3pm, 6-11pmWander into the small village of Warham and you could believe you’ve stepped back into the 1950s. The interior of the pub does its best to maintain this illusion. One room resembles a Victorian sitting room, with a portrait of her imperial majesty and another of local lad Lord Nelson flanking an old piano. Another room is a scullery full of old posters advertising Oxo, mustard powder and bile beans. This interior may not be strictly “authentic” – the landlord is a keen collector – but that really doesn’t matter. It’s still an absorbing escape from the 21st century. • warhamhorseshoes, Mon-Sat 11am-11pm, Sun noon-10pmLondon’s last galleried coaching inn is hidden inside a former railway goods yard: you could work on busy Borough High Street for years without spotting this National Trust-owned pub. Tourists from the US and Japan cross the river in search of its ancient wooden balconies that stand in defiance of the Shard, looming overhead. Dickens definitely drank here Chaucer began the Canterbury Tales in the Tabard, which stood next door until the 1880s and Shakespeare almost certainly saw plays performed in its courtyard – a predecessor of, and inspiration for, the first purpose-built theatres. • greeneking-pubs, Mon-Thu 11am-11pm, Fri-Sat 11am-midnight, Sun noon-10.30pmDuring the 1819 Peterloo Massacre, the 15th Hussars and the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry – consisting largely of local businessmen – rode past this pub on their way to slaughter unarmed civilians. The place had a different name then, but according to legend it acquired its new one when it sheltered people from the carnage. The story is told in murals on the pub’s walls, and along corridors which always seem to lead to snug corners you never noticed on previous visits. A lone survivor of long-demolished streets, this hulk of a building still seems to succour the exhausted office workers who slump through its doors. • On Facebook, Mon-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1am, Sun noon-11pmAs places where communities gather, Belfast pubs were easy targets during the Troubles, and the Sunflower wasn’t the only one to be attacked. It is, however, the only one that retains a monument to those times in the shape of the iron cage outside the door, where people could be checked for weapons. Today, the cage remains unlocked. A slogan on the wall beside it, copied from long-gone graffiti just up the road, reads: “No topless bathing. Ulster has suffered enough,” reminding drinkers that humour was always a defence against adversity. • sunflowerbelfast, Mon–Thu noon -midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1am, Sun 5pm-midnightPurpose-built as an inn in the 14th or 15th century, the George has been endlessly remodelled since (recent work revealed 15 types of plaster on the top floor alone). Its visual attraction lies in additions that are clearly very old sitting atop stone so ancient it almost seems to be melting. Inside, the open fires, candlelit tables and leaded windows feel unchanged rather than artificially preserved or restored, evoking centuries of people sitting here eating, drinking and laughing. Upstairs, the creaking bedrooms will provide a challenge for even the most sceptical disbeliever in ghosts.• georgeinnnsp. Mon-Sat 10am-10pm, Sun noon-10pmThis red-brick Victorian pub is a classic example of designs that are much more beautiful than they strictly needed to be. Joyless reformers used to complain that features like tiles, stained glass and snob screens, all beautifully preserved here thanks to a Grade II listing, used to keep people in pubs spending money they didn’t have. There was also a view that the poor simply didn’t deserve surroundings like this: it would give them ideas. Laurel and Hardy drank here when performing in Birmingham, and even served behind the bar.• thebartonsarms, Mon-Sat noon-11pm, Sun noon-10.30pmMany pubs offer the promise of stepping back in time. The difference with the Canny Man’s is that you can’t be quite sure what time you’re stepping back into. At first glance it’s Victorian, but the 1940s crooning from the jukebox, the plush Venetian red stools, the collections of parasols, photographs, musical instruments and several lifetimes worth of random stuff, mean that if you were born any time between 1930 and 1980, this place will remind you of visiting an ancient aunt. She never had a drinks list this good though.• cannymans, Sun-Wed 11am-11pm, Thu 11am-midnight, Fri-Sat 11am-1amHidden down a back alley (like any self-respecting ancient tavern), Whitelocks is the oldest pub in Leeds. Built in 1715, it is long and narrow with low ceilings. You’re inevitably pressed up close to a bar that seems filled with more drinks than you could have thought possible. The eight-inch step up behind the bar means the staff gaze benignly down on you, making you feel like a grown child in a magical, alcohol-infused sweet shop. The beer selection is timeless rather than old-fashioned: the sister bar next door is full of craft beer, but in places like this, decent ale never went away.• whitelocksleeds, Mon-Thu 11am-midnight, Fri-Sat 11am-1am, Sun 11am-11pmThe very best pubs serve as extensions of the publican’s personality, and may even be manifestations of their passions and interests. High in the Preseli hills, and built of pinky-red corrugated iron, Tafarn Sinc was thrown up quickly as a train stop connecting the slate mines in the hills to the towns in the valleys below. There’s no reason why it should now be a pub with a garden featuring mannequins on an old station platform and steam train sound effects. But there’s no reason why it shouldn’t, either. • tafarnsinc.cymru, daily 11am-late (closed Mon in winter)By Pete Brown, author of Miracle Brew: Adventures in the Nature of Beer (Cornerstone, £9.99). Available at  Bookshop for £8.59Despite its location between Cowgate and the Royal Mile, this bar and 350-strong bottle shop remains cool, calm and civilised, even in Edinburgh’s busiest seasons. Twelve keg lines pour innovative beers from breweries as distant as Leith’s Pilot and London’s Partizan (in pints now too, not just schooners!), and you can drink anything from the shop in the bar (£2 corkage). Tap takeovers with the likes of Burning Sky or Malmö’s Rocket add further interest.In this plainly decorated former Georgian coaching inn, the cask ale selection starts out traditional (Stancill’s Barnsley Bitter, £2.60 a pint), but its keg lines are devoted to wild, modernist beers from global leaders such as Manchester’s Cloudwater, Copenhagen’s Warpigs and Barcelona’s Garage Beer. Its cask beer festivals (the next is 29 Nov-1 Dec) are a riot of one-off brews, as are the Shakespeare’s own out-there collaborations (horseradish and beetroot stout, anyone?). Similarly, its Stupidly Delicious Beer events showcase rare, aged imperial stouts alongside just-released, super-fresh double IPAs. • shakespeares-sheffield, Sun-Thu noon-midnight, Fri-Sat noon-1pmOpened in 1997 – when the very concept of a European-style cafe-bar was a novelty, “specialist beer” meant Belgian and the cool kids were still drinking Red Stripe – North has evolved into one of the UK’s foremost beer hangouts. It has also spawned six sister bars and North Brewing Co (which launches its own 24-tap bar in Leeds this November). North’s minimalist, wooden-slat interior – it’s like drinking in the belly of a whale – feels timelessly modern and its caskkeg lines showcase contemporary beers from the northern craft powerhouses alongside international trendsetters such as Brus or Basqueland. Decent, snacky scran and late-night DJs, too. • northbar, Mon-Tue 11am-1am, Wed-Sat 11am-2am, Sun noon-midnightIn a region dominated by St Austell brewery pubs, Falmouth is something of craft beer sanctuary (see also, pub-bookshop Beerwolf). A natty bar in the historic Old Brewery Yard, Hand is an 11-tap setup (two gravity-dispensed cask beers are kept in the cellar), which flies the flag for cutting-edge Cornish breweries Harbour, Verdant, and Black Flag, as well as sourcing from far and wide. It recently held a tap takeover with New York brewery Equilibrium. Note: £1.50 corkage to drink in from the bottle shop. • On Facebook, Mon-Thu 1pm-1am, Fri-Sun noon-1amHead out into Ouseburn and there are grittier (Free Trade Inn) and quirkier (Cumberland Arms) pubs that are equally essential, but this surprisingly swanky brewpub under the Tyne Bridge – part post-industrial craft bar, part gentleman’s club – is a cosy winter bolthole. It is closely associated with the excellent local Wylam brewery, whose beers feature prominently, as do experimental creations from the pub’s own microbrewery. The Bridge’s food is relatively affordable and reliably brilliant. • thebridgetavern, Sun-Thu noon-11pm, Fri-Sat noon-1amThe best beer bar in London? That is impossible to call. It is a huge city with numerous options which, either on choice (Craft Beer Co, Euston Tap) or novelty for a beer tourist (Crate, the Harp, the Rake), might easily fill this slot. A stylish railway arch bar in Bethnal Green, Mother Kelly’s gets the nod because across its six fridges and 19 keg beer taps, even the most well-travelled beer geek will find something new and arresting. From a Three Floyds and Burning Sky collaboration to Metal Face, an aged mixed-fermentation saison from Oxbow Brewing (no, me neither), Mother Kelly’s is a feast of one-offs, experimental ales and rare collaborations from around the world – some eye-wateringly expensive. • motherkellys, Mon 4pm-11pm Tue-Thu noon-11pm Fri-Sat noon-midnight, Sun noon-11pmDown by the Mersey, hot new craft outlets come (Dead Crafty, Black Lodge brewtap) and go (RIP the 23 Club) but, fittingly, given that its ground floor is decked out to resemble the prow of a boat, the Ship ploughs steadily on through every new wave in beer. Originally, a real ale pub, the Ship now has 10 cask pumps augmented by 14 craft-keg lines of constantly rotating joy. The Ship also runs a city-centre bottle shop (Ship In A Bottle), the Flagship brewery and the Wirral Beer Festival (Easter 2019). • theshipandmitre Sun-Wed 10am-11pm, Thu 10am-midnight, Fri-Sat 9am-midnightBy Tony Naylor,  food and drink writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0312c40de39a9af32d6ed3b4f325bafc67371a7b/344_1003_5641_3385/master/5641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=312fff23789e9a827c898efb96607000","title":"the joke is always on us how people just do nothing struck comedy gold","story":"From YouTube to a Bafta and now a film, the old mates behind the BBC show have hit the big timeIn a dimly lit room backstage at an underground club in east London, four men in their 30s share their masturbation secrets with me. Seapa finds it difficult at the moment: it hurts. Seapa also says (Seapa does most of the talking) that Steve does it with his legs behind his head, and that he spits on his... Well, I won’t say, in case you’re having your breakfast.Anyway, he’s joking, he says. “We all wank perfectly normally.”Until Seapa remembers Hugo. “Hundred per cent a fact: Hugo has to do it on his knees.”Rather than deny it, Hugo corrects him. “Not even on my knees,” he says. “Squatting on all fours.” He has an explanation, too, one that harks back to his teens and verges on the Freudian. “I think it’s when I had a family computer downstairs at this level,” he says, indicating its height. “Literally, the laptop’s there and my chin’s there…” I’m not totally picturing it, and not trying too hard, to be honest the four of them crack up.Apologies for sharing, but this is symptomatic of the entire 90 minutes I spend with Seapa, Steve, Asim and Hugo. These men know each other very well, are proper friends from way back, with no secrets, no no-go areas, and who cares if there’s a geezer from the  here as well (“You’re a journalist, you’re not a human,” Seapa tells me). They relentlessly take the piss, out of each other, out of me they’re boysy, rude, open, very funny – inidually, collectively, all ways.It has to be said that the line between fact and fiction isn’t always clear. I’d guess the story about Hugo is true, about Steve not (I hope). I’m not even sure how we got on to masturbation. Oh, yes, they were talking about “blazing” (smoking weed, something else they do a lot of, although there’s some talk of having stopped) and how it affects the senses, vision and touch, and it progressed naturally from there, do you see?As well as being blazers and wankers, they – real names Allan “Seapa” Mustafa, Steve Stamp, Asim Chaudhry and Hugo Chegwin – are the creators, writers (principally Steve and Seapa) and stars of the award-winning BBC comedy People Just Do Nothing.Confession: I’m a fan, big time. If you know the show, you surely will be, too – and if you don’t, you should get involved. A mockumentary sitcom centred on Kurupt FM, a pirate radio station broadcasting UK garage to not very many people at all in west London, it won a Bafta last year (beating Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag), which Seapa doesn’t let you forget.People Just Do Nothing is not a million miles from The Office – in actual mileage (it’s about 10 from Brentford to Staines), as well as in format and vibe. They’re massive fans of Ricky Gervais’ show: Seapa’s character, MC Grindah, is a kind of tower-block David Brent, while The Office producer Ash Atalla has become their executive producer. (As well as Gervais, they mention Alan Partridge, Brass Eye, Peep Show, Spinal Tap, Summer Heights High and documentaries such as the BBC Three series Tower Block Dreams.)But PJDN is much more than The Office at 130bpm. It’s a heartfelt homage to a very different world – beautifully observed, authentic down to the music samples and trainer brands, because it’s a world its makers know inside out, having grown up in it. It’s more than a television show, too as Kurupt FM, they have toured clubs and venues, played Glastonbury and taken over Radio 1Xtra.You don’t need to know your UK garage from your drum’n’bass, or be a pirate radio aficionado, to appreciate People Just Do Nothing. Because, more than anything, it’s about people – not doing nothing, so much as doing the wrong thing.I realise this could be getting a little muddly: four different characters, being played by four different people. Usually, for interviews, as with their live shows, Kurupt FM remain in character. Today, they’re letting the masks slip, but it’s a blurry line between the real and the invented. So, for reference, your cast:MC Grindah, convinced he’s the greatest MC on the planet, unwisely unwilling to let go of the dream, unrelated to the dating app played by Allan “Seapa” Mustafa, 33, who also writes.DJ Beats, Grindah’s lieutenant, loyal and loving, in spite of Grindah’s bullying (he is like a badly treated labrador) played by Hugo Chegwin, 33. Hugo, incidentally, is a nephew of Keith “Cheggers” Chegwin. Doesn’t play pop, though.Chabuddy G, their sort-of manager, a wheeler-dealer Arthur Daley kind of fella and hopeless entrepreneur played by Asim Chaudhry, 31.Steves, basically on drugs, a “wiggy mess”. If they were the Happy Mondays, he’d be Bez played by Steve Stamp, 33, who also writes.Even if you’ve never tuned into a pirate radio station, let alone been to one, you will know one or more of a Grindah, a Steves, a Beats and a Chabuddy G. Know and likely also love, because, despite their absurd foolishness, there is lots to root for, too.It’s also about jokes – ongoing jokes, such as Angel, Grindah’s daughter with his girlfriend (later wife) Miche, who clearly isn’t – biologically speaking – Grindah’s daughter, on account of the colour of her skin (she’s mixed race Miche and Grindah are white). Then there are the smaller, more ephemeral jokes, such as Grindah’s definition of salvation: “McDonald’s on the horizon when you need a shit.” Or Chabuddy G’s devotion to Sean Paul Gaultier fragrance. Or Chabuddy’s explanation of what hormones are: “Little balls of anger that live inside women.”Yes, PJDN is undeniably blokey. “It’s tricky, because pirate radio is such a boys’ club,” says Steve, possibly the most thoughtful of the four, and definitely the tallest. “I think we’ve worked hard to try and get more of the female perspective in there.” This comes mainly via Miche (the brilliant Lily Brazier, who grows into the role and demands a place at the cast’s top table).“One thing I would say, though, is the joke is always on the men,” Seapa says. “Grindah’s pretending to be this bravado guy, but he always gets bit on the arse and looks like a dickhead in the end.”The show’s pilot and the first four episodes were only loosely threaded together. But from the second series, story arcs began to form, narrative rainbows over the concrete Brentford skyline – themes, issues, even. Not just male hopelessness, but loss and grief, addiction, bankruptcy and homelessness, abusive relationships. Prepare yourselves – in the fifth and final series – for gentrification. And, sadly, for everyone having to grow up. First, though, back to the beginning...If you’re up to speed, you’ll know this means going back to the beginning halfway through – just as Grindah does in the middle of Grindah and Beats’s track, Heart Monitor Riddim (Lyrical Blow To The Jaw). “So me and Steve used to run a dogging company, out of a car park in Guildford,” Seapa says in the dingy backstage room (the club was the location for today’s cover shoot this room, though horrid, seems entirely appropriate).“We were on a forum, because we all caught the same disease,” Hugo adds.Neither is true (I don’t think). But they all agree that Hugo was central to the beginning of what became a beautiful thing. “Hugo’s the clitoris,” Seapa says, taking it back down there. That’s Seapa’s role, as well as doing most of the talking, and the reminding about their Bafta.Hugo – more of an introvert, less readable, equally comfortable with filth – goes with it: “And these guys are my orgasm.” Loads of laughing at that.Here’s the actual truth (I think). Hugo grew up next door to Steve in Brentford, on the other side of the M4 motorway from the towers of the Haverfield Estate, as featured in the show. Hugo met Asim (from Hounslow) and Seapa (from Chessington) at Thames Valley College through a shared passion for smoking weed and creating music. Hugo would make hip-hop beats in his room Asim rapped and made videos. Seapa ran a tinpot pirate radio station, and hung around squat parties and raves.When Seapa and Hugo dropped out of college, they used their student loans to visit Steve in Thailand he was travelling having finished uni (English literature at Sussex). They went to beach parties, where Steve, who wasn’t really taking serious drugs, would pretend to be on pills just for a laugh. (This was the birth of his character Steves.)Back in London, they continued to hang out, smoking more weed, messing around with Xbox Live and early camera phones, creating more characters. They used to make prank calls, too, which is where Asim’s character, Chabuddy G, began, partly inspired by his father, a bit of a hustler who once ran a business from a portable office.I wonder if Asim – warm and instantly likable – has ever been accused of stereotyping, playing a comedy south Asian businessman with a finger in a lot of pies? “I’ve had a bit,” he says. “But you have to look at the detail behind it, the layers of research that go into it, and the real-life connection you have to it.”Anyway, Asim, who had been camera operator (because he had a camera), was now in it, as Chabuddy G, even if he wasn’t clear what it was.What would become People Just Do Nothing was born, chiefly, out of experience, hence the pinpoint authenticity. But the irony of authenticity is that a lot of work went into it.They created their characters, and improvised material that they posted on Asim’s YouTube channel. Some of the people they knew wondered why the hell they were doing it, investing all this time and energy into posting YouTube clips (this was before everyone starting spending all their time posting YouTube clips).“We were about 24, and everyone else was working, and we hadn’t really achieved anything,” Seapa says. “We didn’t start out like, ‘This is going to be on telly and earn money’, we just did it. We were in shit, dead-end jobs, but we always made sure we were doing something creative.”At one point, three of them were working in the same call centre. Hugo also worked at a will-writing firm, in accounts (if he were in The Office, he’d be Tim).“All I had on my CV were admin jobs that I wasn’t proud of,” Steve says. “If I wanted to get something I enjoyed, I would have to create my own work and show that I can do stuff outside the admin world. There always needed to be projects – writing.”Steve always wanted to write. “I didn’t know if it was going to be scripts or...”“Romantic novels,” Steve agrees, going along with it, a little resignedly at first, then raising him. “Erotic novels.”“At one point, you were into Ukrainian erotic novels, weren’t you?” Seapa asks, not just seeing him, but raising him further. And they’re all off again: they were all into Ukrainian erotic novels and read them aloud together, sitting back to back, topless, but no one wanted to do it with Asim, because of his back hair. Make up your own mind about the veracity of that one.The YouTube episodes were not an overnight viral sensation the viewers trickled in over a couple of years. But the producer Jon Petrie, who worked with Atalla at the independent production company Rough Cut TV, saw them and got the boys in for a meeting in early 2011.“They basically said, ‘Are you happy for us to approach channels on your behalf and try to get you a pilot?’” Steve says.They were keen to – and did – retain creative control, hanging on to the baby that had been conceived over a big chunk of their lives, in their bedrooms, blazing, back to back (maybe). But they also got some help with things like how to write a script, which they hadn’t done before: the YouTube webisodes were all improvised.Today, there is still room for improv to sneak in: they reckon it’s about 70-30 script to improv in the final cut. “We’ve been in these characters since 2010, so we’re very comfortable with them,” Asim says. “We know how they’re going to react, what they’re going to say.”After the pilot went out on BBC Three in 2011, a series was commissioned, followed by a second, then a further two. The Bafta came after a poignant third series that ends – on Valentine’s Day – with a birth and a death.There’s irony in their success, too, because, while in many ways their lives mirror those of their characters, they have also left them way behind. A big part of the ongoing joke is that, while Kurupt FM claims to be the biggest and baddest pirate station in the land, even the more conservative claim of “over 100 listeners” is hopelessly optimistic – it’s probably time to think about throwing in the mic. Whereas for Seapa, Steve, Asim and Hugo, things are kicking off big time. It’s not just the series, the live show and the real radio station takeovers (where they hold their own alongside Stormzy and Craig David) there is the hilarious sketch they did with very game “urban artist” Ed Sheeran on Comic Relief last year (they attempt to make him “less shit”) Chabuddy G has a comedy advice book out, How To Be A Man and if you’ve taken a British Airways flight recently, you will have seen him as the lead in the (actually funny) safety video. After this final series, there’s going to be a film, which they’re working on (they’ve been talking to the Inbetweeners people, who successfully translated their sitcom to the big screen).About all of which, they’re dead proud – not so much about where they’ve got to, more where they started from. “Where I’m from, no one I know has come into this industry,” Seapa says. “I didn’t even know it was an option.”“You don’t have to come through the conventional route,” Asim adds. “You don’t have to go to the Edinburgh festival, you don’t need to be in a drama club, you don’t need to do this – you’ve got a camera, you’ve got funny friends.”“For the younger generation who’ve grown up with YouTube and stuff, maybe we can be a small inspiration,” Hugo starts to say, before being interrupted by Seapa: “Hugo Chegwin, motivational speaker!”Speaking of sic, they don’t say sick (with a k, for Kurupt FM), as in good, as much as they do on the show. Or trust me. Or bruv. But they do finish each other’s sentences, as only people who are close do. Mostly Seapa finishes them.What is clear – while we talk, but also watching them arse about in the photoshoot – is they enjoy hanging out together, and it’s from this, and trying to make each other laugh, that the comedy comes. “These are my funniest friends,” Steve says. “The more I work with other actors, I realise that, even though we’re not actors, what we do in front of camera is impressive.”Asim agrees, and says that for him it’s mainly about trying to make Steve crack up. Hugo talks of the journey, the experiences, the bond they’ve formed – something that a lot of music acts don’t have.Are they the Beatles of Brentford? “I don’t know,” Seapa says. “Have they got a Bafta?”Our time is up and Seapa has the last word, unsurprisingly. Nor is the direction he takes it in surprising. “Nice little chat,” he says. “Hope that was good for you.” And he laughs, they all do. “It’s like we just had sex.”• The fifth and final series of People Just Do Nothing starts on BBC Two next month.

A 14th device was reported by the billionaire Tom Steyer, who has called for Trump’s impeachment.Cesar Sayoc was arrested at an auto parts shop in the city of Plantation on Friday morning. His white van, which was covered in stickers celebrating Republicans and denouncing the president’s opponents, was parked outside.Sayoc, 56, has an address in the Miami suburb of Aventura and an extensive arrest record. According to his social media accounts, he works as a booking agent for a live events company and is a former wrestler and cage fighter.Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, said at a press conference in Washington Sayoc had been charged with five offences including threats against former presidents, assaulting current and former federal officers and mailing explosives. The charges were filed to federal court in Manhattan.“Let this be a lesson to anyone, regardless of their political beliefs, that we will bring the full force of law against anyone who attempts to use threats, intimidation and outright violence to further an agenda,” Sessions said.Asked why most of Sayoc’s alleged targets were Democrats, Sessions said: “He appears to be a partisan.” A court filing said the stickers covering Sayoc’s van included “images critical of CNN”, the TV station frequently derided by Trump, whose New York studios were the target of two bombs.Speaking at the White House, Trump praised the “incredible job” done by investigators and promised to punish the person responsible. Speaking later at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump won applause from his loyalist supporters for calling for national unity and an end to political violence. But he soon attacked the media, encouraged chants of “CNN sucks” and set the audience up to boo the Democratic House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and reprise “lock her up” chants aimed at Hillary Clinton.FBI director Christopher Wray said Sayoc had been linked by a fingerprint to a package sent to the California congresswoman Maxine Waters. DNA possibly from Sayoc was also found in one of the packages, Wray said, stressing that they contained authentic explosives.“These are not hoax devices,” Wray said, adding that more could yet be in the mail.Three bombs were confirmed by authorities when charges were brought, bringing to 13 the number known to have been sent. None exploded before being found and no injuries were reported.The packages found on Friday were sent to two senators, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California to James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence. Steyer, a donor to Democratic groups, said an additional suspect package addressed to him was intercepted in Burlingame, California.Sayoc was born in Brooklyn, New York, and registered as a Republican in 2016, according to public records. His social media accounts contain photographs and video clips in which he is wearing Trump’s signature red baseball cap with the slogan “Make America Great Again”.The 56-year-old has also posted material online denigrating Muslims and raising popular rightwing conspiracy theories including the false claim that Clinton killed a former deputy White House counsel, Vince Foster.He threatened CNN in a tweet in August. Rochelle Ritchie, a former aide to Democratic politicians, said on Friday she reported Sayoc to Twitter earlier this year after he warned her: “Hug your loved ones real close every time you leave you home.” Twitter told her Sayoc had not violated its rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment.Sayoc’s arrest record stretches back more than 25 years and includes charges for theft, battery, domestic violence and other offences. In August 2002, he was found guilty of making a bomb threat to a utilities worker.Daniel Lurvey, an attorney who represented Sayoc in some of his criminal cases, said Sayoc had been “normal and courteous” and did not seem politically angry. “I think it’s a recent phenomenon that’s happening to a lot of people who have feelings under the surface that are brought out by this isive political climate,” said Lurvey.On Friday afternoon, police and security guards were blocking off an upmarket 27-story condominium block in Aventura, where Sayoc has been listed as a resident.Neighbours said they were surprised. But one, Dan Ochsenschlagen, said there had been friction on the condominium board between Sayoc’s mother, the registered owner of the apartment, and other board members. Ochsenschlagen said Sayoc’s mother, who often made political statements, was president of the board for 17 years until she was voted out last December.“Some of the things that were going on were very questionable,” Ochsenschlagen said. He said he had reported what he called “financial irregularities” to police in Miami.  was not immediately able to verify the claims.Authorities hoped Sayoc’s arrest would end the steady discovery of more matching envelopes, containing what appeared to be pipes packed with explosives and connected to wires, across the US. The criminal complaint against Sayoc said the packages included photographs of the targets’ faces that had been crossed out with a red “X”.The first package was discovered on Monday in a mailbox at the New York home of George Soros, a wealthy liberal donor. It was followed by similar packages intercepted by the secret service that were addressed to the homes of Obama and Clinton.Over the following days packages were found addressed to former vice-president Joe Biden, former attorney general Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, Waters and the actor Robert De Niro. All are high-profile opponents of Trump.The package addressed to Booker was intercepted in Florida while the one for Clapper was discovered at a post office in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan. It was addressed to Clapper at the offices of CNN, a few blocks away, where he is employed as an analyst.CNN’s Manhattan offices were evacuated on Wednesday when another suspected pipe bomb was sent there, meant for Brennan. Both former intelligence officials have been outspoken critics of Trump’s actions in office. Clapper on Friday said the packages were part of campaign of “domestic terrorism” intended to sow fear.“This is not going to silence the administration’s critics,” Clapper told CNN. “But anyone who has in any way been a public critic of President Trump needs to be on extra alert and take some precautions particularly with respect to mail.”Clapper praised the FBI for its work and for persevering in the face of abuse from the president. Trump has accused the FBI of being involved in a “deep state” conspiracy to undermine him and of botching an inquiry into a private email server used by Clinton. “Will the FBI ever recover its once stellar reputation?” he asked in a tweet in August.Shortly before the arrest, Trump complained that the attempted bombings were damaging his party’s prospects for next month’s midterm elections. He also appeared to stoke conspiracy theories.“Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this ‘Bomb’ stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows – news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!”, Trump said. The president had also complained in a 3am tweet he was being unfairly blamed for the attempted bombings.The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said Trump’s reaction was “wholly inappropriate” and showed he had “never fully made the transition” to being presidential. “Am I hopeful that the zebra changes his or her stripes today? No,” Cuomo said on CNN.Supporters of Trump speculated without evidence that the devices were not viable and could not have harmed people. Cuomo said: “No one can say that they were fake bombs. These were dangerous devices that could explode.”De Niro made his first remarks on the pipe bomb discovered at his offices in lower Manhattan. “I thank God no one’s been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us,” he said. “There’s something more powerful than bombs, and that’s your vote. People must vote!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/602a2b8e7bc0260ed598ebf5dbd49c65230ad64f/0_211_4314_2589/master/4314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a92b75584d4806c2073cbd743888444","title":"democrats see bright future rooted in bernie sanders impact","story":"‘We’re building the socialist wing of a broader movement’ says organizers of Democratic groupsThe left is pouring its energy into the November midterm elections.

That lawsuit would have covered more women, but a judge dismissed it.“The civil complaint, filed a year ago, alleged that Google was paying women less than men doing similar work while also denying promotions and career opportunities to qualified women who were ‘segregated’ into lower-paying jobs,” Sam wrote.On Thursday, the New York Times published an investigation saying Google paid a $90m severance package to an executive while concealing details of a sexual misconduct allegation against him.Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders “have been conflated for years”, writes Bhaskar Sunkara, the founding editor of Jacobin. But they shouldn’t be.Sanders “was trained in the dying remnants of the Socialist party and cut his political teeth in trade union and civil rights organizing”, Sunkara says.Warren, meanwhile, despite establishing herself as a progressive Democrat, believes that markets and corporations can be reined in by policy – which Sundara says is different from Sanders’ “worker-centric” approach:“Elizabeth Warren is a progressive who can be an important part of a broad coalition for change, but we need a democratic socialist leading that coalition if we’re to deliver it.”The origins of the #MeToo movement are a decade older than the first allegations against Harvey Weinstein, the ACLU says.

Jolley acknowledged that California, which began recreational pot sales this year, is expected to dominate the industry in size and scale. But John Restrepo, principal analyst at Las Vegas-based RCG Economics, which produced the analysis, said: “Nevada will be a very important market and should be a leader in regulations.”Nevada received just under $70m in tax revenues on that figure, including $27.5m for schools and about $42.5m for a state “rainy day” contingency fund. Nevada is among nine states and Washington DC that have legalized recreational marijuana. Sales got off to a rocky start amid a legal battle over distribution licenses, and tourists still do not have a place to legally smoke the pot they can buy. Hotels do not allow smoking in rooms and laws regulating marijuana lounges have not been approved. Smoking is not allowed in a Las Vegas museum, Cannabition, that recently opened and features a glass bong taller than a two-story building. Democratic state senator Tick Segerblom, the legislative godfather of Nevada’s marijuana law, said on Friday lawmakers should allow pot-centered venues ranging from spas to yoga studios to concerts and festivals. “You can’t encourage people to come to Nevada to buy marijuana and then say, ‘Oh by the way, you can’t use it here,”’ he told the dispensary association.The economic report said 64 retail dispensaries are now open statewide, with more than half in Las Vegas. The 40 businesses that participated in a survey for the report employed about 1,300 people. The report projected more than 8,000 jobs in the industry in the next six years. It did not look at public safety, health, human services, schools or criminal justice costs associated with legalization. In Washington state, where voters legalized pot in 2012, a 2017 report examined two years of data and found no evidence that recreational sales affected cannabis abuse treatment admissions. It found that adults 21 and older were “significantly” more likely to report heavy cannabis use in parts of the state with high per-capita sales. In Nevada, the report said marijuana cultivation and production is centered in and around Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Pahrump. It said 99 of 120 licensed marijuana farms and 69 of 83 processing sites are in Clark and Nye counties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

Sorry, but the answer is no!Nikki Waller, a Wall Street Journal editor recently did something extremely brave and incredibly difficult. She went a month – an entire month! – without using exclamation marks in email. The point of this sadomasochistic experiment was to investigate why the perky punctuation mark has become such a ubiquitous part of office communication and why so many people, particularly women, are self-conscious about their exclamation mark habit.Female bosses, Waller notes, “tread a thin line”. To be taken seriously in the workplace, women have to project gravitas and authority but also not come across as too tough and unfeeling.“Routine emails can become complex calculations about warmth, likability and authority,” she writes, with exclamation marks offered like olive branches. Like me! But respect me. But like me! While freeing herself from her exclamation addiction, Waller says, was tricky, it “felt great”. No longer weighing the emotional impact of every sentence, she felt like “just another manager, making sure work gets done”.There has been much written, in recent years, about whether women should cut down on exclamation marks in the office. Just as there has been much written about how women should stop saying sorry so much. And how they should be more assertive. And how they should speak up more. The upshot of all this advice is that if you want to get ahead in the corporate world, you should act a lot more like a “man”.Sorry, but I find that infuriating! Women are socialized to be people-pleasers, sure, but there’s nothing wrong with that. Trying to make other people feel comfortable is a good thing. It should be encouraged! Rather than telling women to lean in to obnoxious behavior, we should be encouraging a corporate world that isn’t governed by stereotypically male values. We should be teaching men to act more like women.We should also stop complaining about the proliferation of exclamation marks. Grammar snobs may love to hate them, but the reason we are so fond of them is that they’re an incredibly efficient way of conveying tone in electronic communication. It’s time we just got over exclamation inflation and embraced the much-maligned form of punctuation once and for all!Sahle-Work Zewde, a seasoned UN diplomat, has become the only female head of state in Africa. Her unanimous appointment comes a week after Ethiopia reorganized the government so women had half of all cabinet posts. While the role of president is largely ceremonial in Ethiopia, Sahle-Work’s ascension is still hugely significant. “In a patriarchal society such as ours, the appointment of a female head of state not only sets the standard for the future,” Fitsum Arega, the chief of staff for the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, said on Twitter. “But also normalizes women as decision-makers in public life.”On Thursday the New York Times published a report alleging Google protected a former employee, Andy Rubin, from sexual misconduct charges. After Rubin, who created Android, was accused of coercing a female colleague into a sex act, Google allegedly investigated and found the claim credible. The New York Times say that he was asked to resign but given “a hero’s farewell” and a $90mn exit passage to soften the blow. After the story was published Google’s CEO sent an email to all employees saying it had been “difficult to read” and the company was “dead serious about making sure we provide a safe and inclusive workplace”.Randa Siniora, general director of the Women’s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling in Palestine, recently became the first female Palestinian campaigner to address the UN security council. “The Israeli occupation and the resulting humanitarian crisis are deeply gendered and exacerbate existing gender inequalities,” she said. “Women disproportionately endure the violence of occupation borne by all Palestinians, and often with gender-specific consequences.”But women are overlooked in the political debate. The plight of Palestinian women is also frequently overlooked by western feminists, I would add. Then again, there are so many more important things to write about. Such as: are exclamation points sexist?Yeah, I know penguins have nothing to do with the patriarchy, but it’s been a tough week.

The investigation was later dropped after police decided insufficient numbers of people had been outraged.Ireland voted to allow same-sex marriage in 2015, and nearly two-thirds of Irish voters backed the repeal of the country’s abortion ban in May this year, leading the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, to proclaim the “culmination of a quiet revolution for the past 10 or 20 years”.The  poll, conducted by IpsosMRBI, questioned more than 4,300 voters outside 160 polling stations across the country. It produced broadly similar projections.The results of both polls were published at 10pm as polling stations closedMore than 3.2 million people were entitled to vote in 40 constituencies across the country.Opinion polls throughout the campaign consistently placed Higgins as the favourite, despite being plagued by questions over presidential expenses.If re-elected, the 77-year old will become the fifth Irish president to serve for two terms.

The supreme court, which is empowered to resolve constitutional disputes, is shut for the weekend and reopens on Monday.The president’s United People’s Freedom Alliance party had earlier Friday quit the coalition that had governed with Wickremesinghe’s party.Speaking to jubilant supporters outside his Colombo home late Friday, Rajapakse also called on Wickremesinghe to step down.Members of his party must “respect democracy, respect the country and respect the law”, the former president said through a loudhailer from a balcony.Rajapakse loyalists stormed two state-owned television networks overnight – which they regard as loyal to the outgoing government – and forced them off the air.Video footage from private networks showed police overwhelmed by mobs at the Rupavahini national TV station but elsewhere in the capital streets remained calm.As president for nine years beginning in 2005, Rajapakse crushed the Tamil Tigers in 2009, ending a 25-year conflict, but refused to acknowledge abuses committed during the bloody civil war. The United States called on all sides in Sri Lanka to operate within the constitution and refrain from violence, and urged the island to move forward on post-war reconciliation.“We call on all parties to act in accordance with Sri Lanka’s constitution, refrain from violence and follow due process,” the State Department said. Constitutional lawyers, political activists and pundits have debated on social media and Sri Lankan TV whether Wickremesinghe’s ouster was legitimate. The constitution says the president has the right to appoint someone he thinks has a majority in parliament.But the 19th amendment, added in 2015, says a prime minister can only be removed when he or she ceases to be a member of parliament such as for failing to meet criteria to be an elector or candidate, when a vote of no-confidence is passed, or when he or she chooses to resign.“At the moment, there is a constitutional crisis – two persons each claiming to be the prime minister,” said Jehan Perera, executive director of the nonpartisan National Peace Council of Sri Lanka.“What the president now should do immediately is to summon Parliament and have a vote. That’s the democratic way to resolve this crisis,” Perera said.Rajapaksa lost a bid for re-election in 2015 amid mounting allegations of corruption and nepotism. Under his former government, dozens of journalists were killed, abducted and tortured and some fled the country fearing for their lives.His return to power as prime minister could signal that Sri Lanka is sliding back to an era of violence against political opponents, critics and journalists, observers said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e489093301500bd338e7b324ca7c80f65779e6c5/0_323_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d02c2feeaffa37d756e08d62199d3248","title":"uns outgoing syria envoy wants regime to stop being obstructive","story":"Staffan de Mistura has been frustrated that Syria is resisting the creation of a potentially vital committeeStaffan de Mistura, the outgoing UN special envoy for Syria, will today plead with Russia, Turkey and European powers to use the next month to force the Syrian regime to stop blocking the establishment of a committee to draw up a new constitution that could be key to ending the seven-year civil war.Syria agreed with Russia at the beginning of the year to co-operate with the committee but has reneged on the plan as it eyes a non-negotiated total military victory.The committee had been seen as the best hope for a peaceful resolution to the war, but western powers believe the Syrian regime, victorious on the battlefield, is now being allowed by Russia to obstruct the plan.Western countries believe that if no progress is made towards setting up the committee, Syria is likely to restart its efforts to recapture the province of Idlib where a fragile ceasefire had prevented an attack on the 3 million-strong province.De Mistura told the UN security council that the Syrian foreign ministry refused on Wednesday to accept the UN had any role in setting up the committee and raised objections to the names of the independent members the UN had proposed to include.The independents, including women, ethnic groups and civil society, are due to represent a third of the committee alongside a third for the Syrian government and a third for the opposition groups.The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will meet today in Istanbul with De Mistura, along with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, and the French president Emmanuel Macron. Russia initially proposed the committee at a meeting convened amidst fanfare in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in January.Moscow seems reluctant to acknowledge the role that was given at Sochi to the UN in drawing up the committee’s composition.Many in the west and some UN officials feel they have been played by Russia as the Syrian government regained territory this year from the opposition. De Mistura recently said he was standing down as UN special envoy after four years for personal reasons, but his departure reflects his frustration at the UN’s lack of leverage in ending the war.Speaking at a briefing of the UN security council in New York, the French envoy to the UN, François Delattre, called for the committee to be created immediately, pointing out the idea had been a Russian diplomatic initiative and claiming the Syrian regime could not be allowed “to ruin our collective efforts without which peace is unachievable”.He said the coming weeks could be crucial and the risk of an escalation of the conflict could not be ruled out.America’s deputy envoy, Jonathan Cohen, said “further obstruction on the committee’s formation is unacceptable. Further delay risks squandering the window of opportunity provided by the Turkish and Russian de-militarised zone that has succeeded in preventing further bloodshed in Idlib and beyond.“Parties have been consulted. No one should doubt that the UN special envoy has the mandate to move forward to establish the constitutional committee. Any list proposed by anyone must have the approval of the special envoy, not just in its membership, but in how it is compiled.”Karen Pierce, the UK envoy to the UN, said she found it incredible that it was necessary to rehearse for the benefit of the Syrian government why the UN was involved in trying to settle the war.“Either Russia has given the UN and this council assurances it has proved too weak to deliver on, or it was all a cynical smokescreen designed to ert attention and energy while Russia, Syria and Iran prosecuted the military campaign,” she said.Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian envoy to the UN, said there are no grounds for artificial deadlines and accused the west of moralising against Russia."},{"url":null,"title":"irish is spoken in house of commons for first time in more than 100 years","story":"  October 24, 2018Plaid Cymru MP is one of only a few MPs to use Irish in the House of Commons   October 25, 2018, 1901: \u0026lsquoAn angry yell of indignant astonishment arose from the Irish benches\u0026rsquo "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676819.1540624742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schoolgirls on brexit the adults are not thinking straight","story":"School children from Crossmaglen talk to Simon Carswell from the  about living on the border, Brexit and the Troubles.

Photograph: Olivia KellyThe   Counting of the presidential election vote is under way in centres across the country with early tallies showing Michael D Higgins is set to be re-elected President of Ireland.Independent candidate Peter Casey is polling strongly ahead of the other candidates, in line with the 21 per cent share of the vote he achieved in the Ipsos MRBI exit poll on Friday night.\u0026nbspCount centre staff began opening the ballot boxes at 9am this morning, sorting the presidential ballots from the blasphemy referendum ballots, which will take place after the presidential count is completed.The exit poll projects that Mr Higgins will win 56 per cent of the vote, comfortably enough to win the election on the first count.The poll was conducted among 4,365 respondents outside 160 polling stations across the country on Friday, and its accuracy is estimated at +-1.5 per cent.Turnout is estimated at about 45 per cent in what would be the lowest of any presidential election since the State was founded.It may also be the highest vote ever in any of the eight presidential elections in the history of the State.The previous lowest turnout for a presidential election was in 1997 when 46.7 per cent of the electorate turned out and Mary McAleese was elected.Mr Casey, whose campaign was marked by criticisms of Travellers and their separate ethnic status, is polling strongly in the early tallies and in Friday’s exit poll he surged ahead of all the other challengers to finish with 21 per cent of the vote.Seán Gallagher, who won half a million votes in 2011, is failing to make any headway in the tallies and the exit poll predicts he will finish with just 7 per cent of the vote - some 22 percentage points less than his 2011 share of the vote, when he won 29 per cent.According to the exit poll, Sinn Féin candidate Liadh Ní Riada won 8 per cent of the vote, Pieta House founder and Senator Joan Freeman won 6 per cent, while Independent candidate Gavin Duffy flopped completely, ending a miserable campaign with just 2 per cent of the vote.In Dublin South Central with 27 per cent of boxes open - Mr Higgins was on 61.2 per cent, Mr Casey on 13.7 per cent, Ms Ní Riada on 9.5 per cent, Ms Freeman on 7.4 per cent , Mr Gallagher on 4.6 and Mr Duffy on 1.3 per cent.In Dublin Central with 59 per cent of boxes open Mr Higgins is on 69 per cent, Ms Ní Riada is on 10.7 per cent, Mr Casey 9.8 per cent, Ms Freeman on 5.5 per cent, Mr Gallagher on 3.4 per cent and Mr Duffy on 1.2 per cent.There were 241 spoiled votes, more than twice the number so far than the 94 voters who gave Mr Duffy their number one in Dublin Central.Mr Duffy is polling as low as 0.1 per cent in early tallies from some county Dublin constituencies.The turnout in parts of Jobstown, near Tallaght, is as low as 9 per cent, according to informal tallies of votes in the Dublin South-West constituency.First-count results for the six Dublin constituencies being counted at the Citywest convention centre in west Dublin are expected in mid-afternoon.In Dublin Fingal with 90 boxes tallied out of 145 in the constituency, Mr Higgins is on 58.8 per cent, Mr Casey on 17.6 per cent and Ms Ni Riada on 9 per cent. Ms Freeman is coming in at 6.3 per cent, Mr Gallagher on 5.7 per cent while Mr Duffy brings up the rear on 2.8 per cent.Mr Casey is polling more strongly in urban centres such as Swords than in more rural parts of the constituency. Ms Ní Riada’s vote is similar to the 9 per cent Sinn Féin secured in the constituency in the last general election, but party workers said her vote seemed to be more transfer-friendly than Sinn Féin’s has been traditionally.In Dublin West, with 87 per cent of boxes tallied, Mr Higgins leads the way on 61 per cent, followed by Mr Casey on 18 per cent. Ms Freeman in in third spot with 7.3 per cent followed by Ms Ní Riada on 6 per cent, well down on Sinn Fein’s general election vote of 14 per cent. Mr Gallagher has 5 per cent of the vote and Mr Duffy has 2 per cent.One Carrigaline box from Cork South Central showed how comfortable Mr Higgins’s victory will be with Mr Casey leading the other challengers in the race for runner up spot.Mr Higgins took 222 votes with Mr Casey on 54, Ms Freeman on 24, Ms Ní Riada on 23, Mr Gallagher on 18 and Mr Duffy taking eight votes of the 349 votes cast.According to tallies in Cork North Central, largely conducted by Sinn Féin with some Labour involvement, Mr Higgins was on 53 per cent after eight boxes while Mr Casey was running at an 25 per cent.Ms Ní Riada was polling at 10.5 per cent - well ahead of Ms Freeman and Mr Gallagher, both on 4.8 per cent with Mr Duffy trailing the field at 1.6 per cent.In neighbouring Cork South Central, Mr Higgins was again comfortably leading the field with 57 per cent after 18 boxes while Mr Casey was on 18.8 per cent with Ms Ní Riada on 10.9 per cent.As in Cork North Central, Mr Gallagher (5.8 per cent) and Ms Freeman (5.5 per cent) were running neck and neck in Cork South Central, while Mr Duffy was again trailing the field at 1.6 per cent.Tallies of over 40 per cent of boxes in Galway West show Mr Higgins running at over 64 per cent, with Mr Casey slipping back from an earlier 23 per cent to 20 per cent.The tallies by Labour and Sinn Féin of over 80 of 200 boxes in the constituency show Ms Ní Riada at over 5 per cent, and Ms Freeman at over 5 per cent, Mr Gallagher at just over 3 per cent and Mr Duffy at 1.4 per cent.Early trends are showing Connemara supporters of Mr Higgins giving Ms Ní Riada their second preference, while city boxes are showing a mix of second preferences - but with Mr Casey polling well. Sinn Féin voters also appear to be opting for Mr Casey as their second choice in Galway West.Mr Higgins recorded a 57.8 per cent vote in his home constituency of Galway West in 2011.In Galway- East, 30 per cent of boxes tallied earlier showed Mr Higgins recording almost 51 per cent, Mr Casey on 33.8 per cent, Mr Gallagher on 5.7 per cent, Ms Freeman on 4.4 per cent, Ms Ni Riada on 3.2 per cent and Mr Duffy on 1.5 per cent. Boxes in Raheen, Gort and Gortanumera showed an overwhelming vote in favour of Mr Higgins.In Roscommon-Galway, a tally of 27 per cent of boxes showed Mr Higgins at 45.4 per cent, Mr Casey on 31.4 per cent, Mr Gallagher on 8.5 per cent, Ms Freeman on 5.9 per cent, Ms Ni Riada on 5.8 per cent and Mr Duffy on 2.9 per cent.Tallies in West County Limerick suggest Mr Higgins will top the poll but Mr Casey is coming in a strong second and Ms Ní Riada is well ahead of the other candidates in third place. Mr Casey polled extremely well in west Limerick towns and villages with high traveller populations including Rathkeale and Abebeyfeale. He also topped the poll in one of the Askeaton boxes according to some tallies. In the village of Glin, Mr Casey received 36 per cent of first preference votes in one box tallied.Turnout in County Limerick was 46 per cent. Meanwhile, first count results for Limerick city are expected around 3pm.Mr Higgins is also polling well in Limerick city averaging at about 58 per cent. Boxes tallied in JFK on the north side of the city showed strong support for the current president with Mr Casey receiving around 23 per cent of first preference votes.Counting for the blasphemy referendum will commence once a winner has been declared in the presidential election.The referendum to delete the reference to blasphemy in the Constitution was, as expected, overwhelmingly passed, with the exit poll predicting that 69 per cent of voters have backed the proposal, while 31 per cent have voted to retain the blasphemy provision.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678326.1540654776!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"duffy s only regret is losing over 100 000 in election campaign","story":"Arriving at Dublin Castle, presidential candidate Gavin Duffy says he has no regrets despite a disappointing finish. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Gavin Duffy and his wife Orlaith Carmody at the result centre for the Presidential Election at Dublin Castle on Saturday. Photograph: Collins Dragons’ Den presidential election candidate Gavin Duffy has said his only regret in the campaign was losing money.The businessman, who looks set to finish with the fewest votes of all six presidential candidates, said: “Any time you lose money you’ve a regret. That’s a regret,” he said. Pressed about how much the campaign cost him, he said it was “definitely over €100,000”. A candidate must secure at least 12.5 per cent of the votes to be able to reclaim their expenses. On the basis of the exit polls and first results, only Michael D Higgins and Peter Casey will reach this threshold. Mr Higgins is set to be re-elected on the first count with exit polls and first results giving him 58 per cent support. “I am disappointed when you contest and you don’t really compete at the end of the day but no regrets and I’m saying that genuinely,” Mr Duffy said on Saturday. Asked where his campaign went wrong, he said: “well it didn’t go right I’d say”.Mr Duffy said he did not find the campaign “bruising”. It was a “test of your values and your character”. He added: “I would be really annoyed if I hadn’t contested”. He noted “one candidate, by mentioning a minority, you can see how that grabs headlines”.Speaking to reporters as he arrived at Dublin Castle for the count on Saturday he said: “I’m the only person in the country who isn’t surprised by Peter (Casey) and the performance”.He questioned whether there was a strategy to Mr Casey’s campaign. “If there was a strategy you’d have to attribute some evil genius to him, which I don’t think he deserves. “He was throwing grenades repeatedly. One of them was going to explode and it did and it drove him up in the polls.”Mr Duffy said five of the six candidates “did not go to that area of populism. We have a President with a socialist track record being returned with a handsome majority.” He said: “I look back on the campaign and I don’t think I did anything very wrong. I just didn’t do enough things to connect with the people of Ireland.”But Mr Duffy quipped he was “concerned” that he liked “much of the cut and thrust of it”.As a result, he did not rule out running for public office again but “I think there’s a perception amongst the public that it’s a bit audacious that the first office you run for is the head of State.... there’s two things in life, you either succeed or you learn.”He was worried at the trends in other parts of the world where people start picking on minorities. “The very reason I entered that was to avoid that.”He called on the Traveller community to not exaggerate the response to comments about them.Mr Duffy said “it just played to the frustrations that some people feel out there. I don’t think it’s a specific minority issue.”He said his son had sent him a message that “he was proud of his parents, what we’d done and that we didn’t go to certain places”.Mr Duffy said he was very positive about Ireland’s future “as long as we don’t go the route of other countries like the US, the UK and parts of Europe that’s emerging and we saw a little bit of that in this election. But it didn’t grab the wind the way it has elsewhere.”Today “was about President Higgins winning a fantastic result, going back with a strong mandate for the next seven years, even though I contested him on that,” Mr Duffy said.

Photograph: CollinsMichael D Higgins is set to be easily re-elected President of Ireland when the votes are counted on Saturday, according an Ipsos MRBI exit poll for The , despite a strong showing for Independent candidate Peter Casey.The poll projects that Mr Higgins will win 56 per cent of the vote, comfortably\u0026nbspenough to win the election on the first count.But turnout was expected to be low, reflecting a lack of public enthusiasm for the contest that was evident throughout the campaign.The poll was conducted among 4,365 respondents outside 160 polling stations across the country on Friday, and its accuracy is estimated at +-1.5 per cent.Mr Casey, whose campaign was marked by criticisms of Travellers and their separate ethnic status, surged ahead of all the other challengers to finish with 21 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts.Opinion polls in the early part of the campaign estimated negligible support for Mr Casey.However, after his criticisms of Travellers, and his assertion that there was a growing culture of welfare dependency in Ireland, support appears to have surged towards Mr Casey in the final weeks of the campaign, with pollsters at some polling stations reporting he was attracting as many voters as Mr Higgins.The other candidates all finished in single figures having made little significant impression on voters.Seán Gallagher, who won half a million votes in 2011, failed to make any headway according to the poll, which predicts he will finish with just 7 per cent of the vote - some 22 percentage points less than his 2011 share of the vote, when he won 29 per cent.But the biggest disappointment was probably for Sinn Féin, whose candidate Liadh Ní Riada won just 8 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts. This is a level far below Sinn Féin’s support at the last general election, and just a third of the party’s current support in the most recent Ipsos MRBI Opinion poll.Pieta House founder and Senator Joan Freeman won just 6 per cent of the vote, the poll predicts. Independent candidate Gavin Duffy flopped completely, ending a miserable campaign with just 2 per cent of the vote, the exit poll finds.The expected result comes after a scrappy campaign that saw no candidate emerge unscathed. While Mr Higgins was never moved from his perch as hot favourite throughout, he shipped considerable criticism over his use of the Government jet, expensive hotel accommodation on overseas visits and the lack of transparency over how an annual €300,000 allowance for his office was spent.Although Mr Higgins was often put on the defensive, especially during the debates he attended, none of the other candidates were able to turn Higgins’s discomfort into support for them, and the incumbent retained a huge lead throughout the campaign.The breakout from the pack of challengers only came late in the campaign with Mr Casey’s criticisms of Travellers and aspects of Ireland social welfare system.The referendum to delete the reference to blasphemy in the Constitution was, as expected, overwhelmingly passed, with the exit poll predicting 69 per cent of voters have backed the proposal, while 31 per cent have voted to retain the blasphemy provision.Younger voters overwhelmingly backed deletion, while older voters were much more evenly split, with 48 per cent voting to retain the constitutional article as it currently stands.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678310.1540650945!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael d higgins vs peter casey some perspective is important","story":"Arriving at the Dublin count at the Convention Centre, Independent candidate Peter Casey says he will run for president again - unless he is Taoiseach at the time of the next presidential election.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins: he won with a resounding majority, the largest ever in a national election. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe    The most important fact of the presidential election is that Michael D Higgins won with a resounding majority, the largest ever in a national election.There has been, and continues to be, an understandably intense focus on the 20-odd per cent that Peter Casey secured in the election. Fair enough: that 20 per cent is important. But the other 80 per cent is important too, no?And that overwhelming majority was dominated by the huge vote for Higgins – an intellectual, a socialist, a man of letters, a man of the left.He has also been a career politician, a democrat and a parliamentarian – someone who has dedicated his life to advancing his social and political goals through the routes of parliamentary politics and public advocacy.Someone who has been content to work our democratic system, even if he has always been impatient with it. Someone who has made the compromises that come with power and so managed to leave a legacy of enduring achievement. Someone conspicuously happy with the status and dignity of the highest office and determined to use it as a rhetorical platform.For all the venom directed at our established way of doing politics and government, someone who is very much of that world has just won 56 per cent of the vote. Casey won 21 per cent. So, you know some perspective is important here.Casey is enjoying his moment in the sun on Saturday. He might found a new party. Or join one. He might stand for office. He might not. He’ll let us know soon. He might run for president again, if he’s not taoiseach. (Sure maybe he could do both?)Students should be able to live on university campuses. People should be able get on the housing ladder. We are too focused on Dublin. We should use the networks of the diaspora. It’s a disgrace that elderly women are on hospital trolleys. And so on and so on, brain-farting out soundbites and platitudes.This isn’t the rise of a new political force. It’s taxi-driver stuff. It’s the end of the bar in the golf club after a long day. It’s Ross O’Carroll-Kelly’s dad with a Derry accent.This was a second order election with a low turnout and a result that was a foregone conclusion. It is the latest indication that there is always – always – a protest vote, a two-fingers to the establishment vote (Sinn Féin gets a chunk of it, usually so do Independents).Do you really think Casey will be a significant figure in our politics in six months? In six weeks? Like Dana is? Like Declan Ganley is? If there was a space for a right-wing, conservative, law and order, low taxes party, then what happened to Renua?That is not to say that Casey’s vote is without significance. It is not. A fifth of the voters is a lot of voters, and despite the candidate’s disavowals on Saturday morning that raising the Traveller issue had contributed to his surge, it’s pretty clear that it did. The Traveller thing was the trigger for him, allowing him to break away from the Higgins challengers, amplifying his voice and focusing his campaigning appeal.Political analysis often makes the rhetorical mistake of seeking one simple answer to what are actually quite complex questions. But the question of why Casey did so well does not just have one answer, it has several Travellers are certainly part of it, but just part of it.Other parts include the traditional protest vote. And the general humpiness of many voters – feeling squeezed by the cost of living, under pressure from everything, running faster and faster just to stand still – is part of that picture.That and the sense among voters that they had a free pass to give anyone and everyone a kick in this election, from which no direct effects on their daily lives were possible, as the President does not do budgets or make social policy.But whatever the exact composition of the Casey vote, it is certain that parties and candidates will be looking closely at it. Casey’s comments about Travellers and the welfare state will no doubt embolden a hundred cheaper imitations in the local elections to come next year.Anyone who thinks that antipathy to Travellers – some of it rooted in prejudice, some of it in response to bad behaviour by some Travellers – is something new in Ireland hasn’t been listening very closely.But it has not been widespread in politics. As a result of this election, that may begin to change. What usually happens is not that a new vehicle emerges for these views – but that the existing parties assimilate them.There is no reason to think it will be different this time. This election has not turned the world upside down. But it will have effects on our politics.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle‘Safe’ 15 mph zones would be worse for the environment than higher speeds, campaigners warnPetrol thefts downgraded as more police forces fail to turn upPlans to turn Mayfair townhouse famed for society soirees into casino has neighbours fumingPolice respond to reports of shooter at Pittsburgh synagogueGalapagos conservationists celebrate as hotel developers seen off by new nature reserveMan dies after fall from third floor window after suspected armed burglars forced their way inFormer England football manager Glenn Hoddle \u0026#39collapses\u0026#39 at BT studiosRoyal tribute to Invictus Games hero who brought British partner back from brink of PTSD episodeLord Hain defends decision to name Sir Philip Green as businessman at centre of #MeToo scandalComment: Only Connect: my love-affair with TV\u0026#39s brainiest quiz showMuch Apu about nothing: why calling The Simpsons racist misses the pointApu \u0026#39to be dropped\u0026#39 from The Simpsons after racism rowKhashoggi suspects will face trial in Saudi Arabia, says foreign minister, as row grows over extraditionDisillusioned shanty town residents  prepared to risk their votes on Brazil\u0026#39s answer to TrumpSnow hits Scotland and northern England with wintry conditions and plunging temperatures across UKSix-year-old boy dies in house fire in DerbyshireJohn Le Carre\u0026#39s sons on Little Drummer Girl: \u0026#39Having a vital female character is resonant in the time of #MeToo\u0026#39BBC presenter recalls how \u0026#39creepy\u0026#39 Donald Trump called her \u0026#39beautiful\u0026#39 Duchess of Sussex reveals little-known visits to troops in AfghanistanWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

Giant tortoises roam the islands, and Blue-footed Boobies – found only in the Galapagos, with their amazing turquoise feet – fascinate visitors. Marine iguanas, unique among modern lizards, also only live in the Galapagos they can live on both land and in the sea, ing to depths of up to 30 feet.The landscape in the Galapagos has been blighted by over 500 non-native plant species, such as eucalyptus trees from Australia, while the native wildlife has been threatened by the introduction of animals such as feral cats, rats and wild goats.“The islands are fighting for their survival,” Mr Salaman added.Mr Salaman, born in Australia but raised in the UK, says that his interest in conservation was sparked by watching Sir David Attenborough on television as a child. He has since met Sir David, and informed him of his inspiring role.A sea lion swims as a tourist takes a picture of it in Santa Cruz Island at Galapagos Marine ReserveThe Galapagos archipelago is located some 600 miles from continental Ecuador and is composed of 127 islands, islets and rocks, of which 19 are large, and four are inhabited.San Cristobal is home to the port city of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the capital of the islands.The government of Ecuador passed a law in June 1959 designating all of the Galapagos Islands a national park, except for those areas owned by existing colonists. As a result, 97 per cent of the land is protected, which Mr Salaman argues is still not enough.Rainforest Trust hopes that their purchase will set an example for other organisations.It\u0027s hoped that in five to ten years the reserve will be turned over to the government of Ecuador and incorporated into the national park. “It’s going to be very labour intensive, and take a massive effort,” he said, adding that he hopes to encourage volunteers such as students, retirees, and those on gap years or sabbaticals to come and join Rainforest Trust’s Galapagos project.“We want to make it part of the protected environment.”Petrol thefts downgraded as more police forces fail to turn upPlans to turn Mayfair townhouse famed for society soirees into casino has neighbours fumingPolice respond to

turn mayfair townhouse famed society soirees casino has","story":"Princes Eugenie at her wedding this month to Jack Brooksbank wore Dame Margaret Greville\u0026#39s emerald and her diamond Kokohsnik tiara that she left to the RoyalsAs one of the early 20th Century’s most renowned and flamboyant society hostesses, Dame Margaret Greville loved nothing more than entertaining the great and good at her lavish Georgian home in London’s Mayfair.Neighbours looked forward to her soirees in the hope of catching a glimpse of guests including King George VI and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, as well as politicians and lords.Following the death of the millionaire in 1942, the Grade II listed townhouse became a gentlemen’s club and then home to Debrett’s, the society etiquette experts, before eventually being turned into offices in the 1970’s.Now controversial plans to transform the imposing building into a 24-hour casino have been met with outrage among the neighbourhood’s well-heeled residents.Instead of glimpsing royalty, they fear they will see an influx of “prostitutes, conmen and moneylenders”.Numerous objection have been filed to Westminster council about the Charles Street proposals lodged by finance company Continuity Capital.One resident, whose identity has not been revealed, wrote: “Crime is on the increase at an alarming rate throughout London. Casinos unfortunately attract money lenders, criminals of various denominations, conmenwomen, malefemale prostitutes.”Another letter lists how serious crimes, including a murder and robbery, have been carried out at British casinos over a number of years. Another complaint lodged said: “A casino would bring undesirable activities to a residential area including drunken and violent behaviour.”The lavish interior of the Mayfair townhouse still has features Dame Margaret Greville personally chose to create sumptuous surroundings for her society soireesWhile many wrote noting how Mayfair was saturated with casinos - there are about seven within walking distance - others fear a designated smoking area could pose an asthma risk to children sleeping nearby with their windows open.One parent said she was “concerned by the health and safety risks from the smoke infiltrating our children\u0027s bedrooms” during the summer months when windows are left open at night.The plans say that the casino would occupy five of the six storeys and feature a “VIP gaming, slots and sports lounge, private lounges, private dining, a restaurant bar area, kitchen and wine stores.” It would hold a maximum of 140 members, with no more than 240 visitors in a single day, and close only on Christmas Day.Some residents fear that a 24 hour establishment could mean a loss of privacy with “guests and staff able to look into our bedrooms all hours of the day and night.”Dame Margaret Helen Greville (1863 - 1942) was a British society host and philanthropist, born Margaret Helen AndersonAnother worry was the prospect that chauffeur driven vehicles ferrying rich gamblers to the area could cause gridlock in the surrounding streets.In his letter opposing the application, Alexander Hauschildt, from the Residents’ Society of Mayfair and St James’s, said it could “damage the atmosphere” in a street made up of predominantly homes and offices.The applicants, however, insists noise would be kept to a minimum because visitors would be asked to leave quietly and any music would be restricted. A tobacco smoke extraction system will be fitted and views into neighbouring properties will be blocked by “inter-layer glass”.They add that any concerns about the sumptuous interior decorations Mrs Grenville required to impress her guests, including Georgian plasterwork dating back to when the house was built in 1753 and two Rococo ceiling, would not be affected and many features would be in fact restored.Mrs Greville was the illegitimate daughter of the Scottish brewer William McEwan who had an affair with a domestic servant.He left her a vast fortune worth the equivalent to £65 million today She and her husband, Reggie Greville were so keen to cosy up to the Royal Family that the Grevilles were nicknamed the Grovels in the society pages of newspapers. King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were regular visitors to their Surrey estate, Polesden Lacey.After her death she bequeathed the Queen Mother a diamond necklace that reputedly belonged to Marie Antoinette, a pair of diamond earrings, tiaras and a ruby necklace.The Greville Emerald and her diamond Kokohsnik tiara was worn by Princes Eugenie at her wedding this month to Jack Brooksbank.‘Safe’ 15 mph zones would be worse for the environment than higher speeds, campaigners warnPetrol thefts downgraded as more police forces fail to turn upPolice respond to reports of shooter at Pittsburgh synagogueGalapagos conservationists celebrate as hotel developers seen off by new nature reserveMan dies after fall from third floor window after suspected armed burglars forced their way inFormer England football manager Glenn Hoddle \u0026#39collapses\u0026#39 at BT studiosRoyal tribute to Invictus Games hero who brought British partner back from brink of PTSD episodeLord Hain defends decision to name Sir Philip Green as businessman at centre of #MeToo scandalComment: Only Connect: my love-affair with TV\u0026#39s brainiest quiz showMuch Apu about nothing: why calling The Simpsons racist misses the pointApu \u0026#39to be dropped\u0026#39 from The Simpsons after racism rowKhashoggi suspects will face trial in Saudi Arabia, says foreign minister, as row grows over extraditionDisillusioned shanty town residents  prepared to risk their votes on Brazil\u0026#39s answer to TrumpSnow hits Scotland and northern England with wintry conditions and plunging temperatures across UKSix-year-old boy dies in house fire in DerbyshireJohn Le Carre\u0026#39s sons on Little Drummer Girl: \u0026#39Having a vital female character is resonant in the time of #MeToo\u0026#39BBC presenter recalls how \u0026#39creepy\u0026#39 Donald Trump called her \u0026#39beautiful\u0026#39 Duchess of Sussex reveals little-known visits to troops in AfghanistanSir Philip Green named as #MeToo scandal businessman by Lord Hain: How British newspapers reactedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/03/12/rtxw6jx.jpg","title":"asda job losses sainsburys merger business finance economy","story":"Created with Sketch.Subscribe  registerSubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsWalmart-owned supermarket said it was looking for ways to improve efficiency in the current competitive retail marketClick to followThe IndependentAsda is set to begin consulting with staff over potential job cuts, and could slash 2,500 roles next year. Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen, are facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the targets set out by the Paris Agreement. Investors have written to 55 companies in total, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups which might oppose progressive climate change policies. Some of the other businesses that have been approached include Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy intensive sectors”, investors said, and the decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. However, the worst effects of global warming - including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities - will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C, a figure the scientists think will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, director of ethics \u0026amp engagement, Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policy making on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeiffer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The settlement allowed the UK government to resume selling off its stake in the bank, which it has held since it bailed out RBS during the crisis.

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not about them -\u0026nbspthe character -\u0026nbspbut the character imposed by the designer.”Vodianova – who was the world’s third highest earning model in 2012 and is currently ranked by models as one of the fashion industry’s New Supers – said the proliferation of social media has changed\u0026nbspthe whole fashion industry.“For young models, it’s really, really hard. It’s really hard without this following. I know a lot of brands are asking models how many followers they have – this dictates whether they get the job or not.\u0026nbsp“It’s interesting because that means personality is celebrated and it’s not really about the brand\u0027s\u0026nbspideal of the, let’s say, face. It’s crazy because very beautiful girls, or whatever that means, will miss out and the job will go out to someone who is very charismatic and funny and has a lot of personality. Some people find it unfair but I think it’s interesting.”The model, who does a range of campaigning work, noted the “competitive” nature of this shift but said it allowed for a greater ersity of models.She argued the growing influence of social media has led the industry to embrace a greater range of body shapes but it still had a long way to go.“A lot of it is forced by social media and by the fact more and more of these conversations are surfacing. The industry sort of follows it like a trend. Unfortunately, it is\u0026nbspstill not normalised enough.“The issues of one type of body and perfection are changing a lot because we now see consumers wanting to see more ersity,” she added. “Big influencers and the brands themselves now have a great presence on social media so they can hear from their consumers directly about what works and what does not. I think this is really positive.”\u0026nbspShe added: “Influence has gone from the industry-at-large to a mix of\u0026nbspimportant influencers.\u0026nbspThe newcomers and Instagram stars mean it is a very different landscape. It’s very interesting.”But she said the issue of body ersity has yet to revolutionise the world of catwalk high fashion – noting such designers create their clothes with slim women in mind.\u0026nbsp“That is the way they want to see it. But then often what is in the catwalk is not what you find in the shop,” she said.Asked whether she thought this provided a negative role model for young girls, she said the responsibility needed to lie with designers rather than the models themselves.Created with Sketch.Model with Down\u0027s syndrome makes strides worldwide Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Model Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekModel Madeline Stuart, who has Down\u0027s syndrome,  standing on a runway during rehearsal at the Angel Orensanz Foundation during New York Fashion Week Madeline having her final touches made before before walking in the Colleen Morris presentation of the SpringSummer 2019 collection during London Fashion WeekMadeline has her makeup applied backstage before the Colleen Morris Presentation Madeline enjoying her time backstage of the Soiree show at London Fashion WeekMadeline walking onto the catwalk for the Colleen Morris presentation Madeline and her mother, Rosanne, pose for photos while sightseeing in Trafalgar Square Madeline walking in the Swedish School of Textiles show at London Fashion WeekMadeline celebrates after stepping out of a taxi cab as she arrives for New York Fashion WeekMadeline looks through a window as her mother is interviewed about Madeline\u0027s modelling careerRosanne Stuart attempts to cover her daughter, Madeline, from rain as they walk to a show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline waits backstage as a dress is steamed before a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline having her make up applied backstage before walking in the Lulu Et Gigi presentation at New York Fashion WeekMadeline being assisted backstage before walking in the Rutu Bhonsle runway show at New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage before walking in the Burning Guitars runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline standing backstage between two male models at New York Fashion WeekMadeline stands among models backstage after walking in the Burning Guitars presentation during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits at the Remedy Diner with her mother and manager Rosanne after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion WeekMadeline sits in the back of a taxi cab after walking in a runway show during New York Fashion Week“What is it to do with catwalk models? We can’t blame catwalk models.\u0026nbspThey are beautiful. And they are often very healthy. They are naturally skinny,” she said. “Whether there should be more ersity, that is another story. A lot of these girls and a lot of these models were born this way. I was born this way so I can speak on their behalf.”\u0026nbspShe called for a greater variety of female body types to be represented on the catwalk. “There will always be a place for girls who are naturally slim, but I would love to see more beautiful, curvy women on the catwalk. I see a lot of these shows and I think it should be more like in real life.”\u0026nbspVodianova joined the United Nations Population Fund to lead a global symposium on tackling the taboos surrounding women’s health around the world in Antalya in Turkey on Thursday and Friday of this week.“Too often women’s health issues go unheard and unnoticed because of unwarranted stigmas and taboos which have let far too many women down for generations,” she said.She said the global issue of period poverty was close to her heart – revealing she was subject to fierce trolling after sharing a photo of herself holding a sanitary pad with her two million Instagram followers.The model said she received\u0026nbsparound 5,000 comments in less than ten hours and\u0026nbspthe reaction of Russian women to the image was “crazy”.“Most of it was harsh criticism saying ‘How can you do this? There are teenagers following you.\u0026nbspWhy don’t you start posting pictures sitting on the toilet? Why don’t you post toilet paper?’ I could not believe my eyes. I am not used to so much hate and criticism thrown my way.”\u0026nbsp“Then I thought this is really cool actually.\u0026nbspiIt proves my point that these conversations are so important. I just did not realise this\u0026nbspshame and stigma was so close to home in Russia.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Campaigners say they are alarmed that the proposal appears to be going ahead despite the lack of a formal public consultation, environmental assessment or parliamentary enquiry.“If given the green light, this development will change the face of England’s countryside forever. Yet no formal assessment of the environmental impact it will have has taken place,” said Paul Miner, head of strategic plans and devolution at CPRE.“Despite costing at least £5.5bn in public money, there has been no formal public consultation around developing the Arc. The lack of debate equates to a major, and troubling, democratic deficit at the heart of the proposals.”Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingGreen MEP for the South East Keith Taylor said the study revealed “the terrifying extent of the impact of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc”, and questioned the legality of pushing ahead without consulting with local communities.“It clearer than ever that the project a monumental disaster and act of environmental sabotage,” he said.Responding to the claims,\u0026nbspan NIC spokesman\u0026nbspsaid: “Our recommendations come with the clear condition that new schemes should not compromise the high quality natural environment for existing and future residents, and do not need to involve any changes to existing Green Belt protections.“In fact, our report made clear the need for significant investment in landscape improvements, affordable housing and sustainable transport. These changes are vital to make the most of the area’s economic potential and the contribution it makes to the wider UK economy.”CPRE\u0026nbsphas called for a full assessment to be conducted that looks at the impact on people’s health and wellbeing as well as environmental impacts including climate change.Instead of investing in the new expressway, the group called for investment in improved public transport in the region alongside a commitment to building “genuinely affordable homes”.The government is aiming to build 300,000 new homes need to be built each year in England to meet demand, and experts have warned of significant backlogs.Mr Brokenshire said: “The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is an opportunity to further strengthen rural economies, enhance the environment and benefit local communities.“Our new planning rulebook strengthens protections for the Green Belt and\u0026nbsp we have sets out our ambition to ensure housing projects are more environmentally friendly.”Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What I\u0026rsquom doing is working cross-party with other colleagues, I\u0026rsquove taken on a consultant - Steve Bullock, who\u0026rsquos a very prominent anti-Brexit campaigner.We\u0026rsquove got to be really sensitive to this. We do need to turn this round because the consequences of delivering Brexit will be awful. The consequences of not delivering Brexit are still significant.It\u0026rsquos a real challenge that we got. We\u0026rsquore on it but sometimes we need to do that a wee bit quieter than perhaps is usually my style.SNP has been publicly opposed to Brexit with the party threatening to vote down Theresa May\u0026rsquos final deal if it excludes a bespoke trade agreement for Scotland.\u0026nbsp14.00 update: Relatives of EU nationals should be allowed to remain in UK after brexit, say ministersA pilot of the scheme to allow EU nationals to remain in the UK after Brexit should be extended to family members, Scottish and Welsh health secretaries have saidThe EU Settlement Scheme pilot, due to begin in November, is open to health and social care workers and university staff, offering them the chance to apply for settled status before the UK leaves the EU in March.However family members are not included and will have to wait to a later date to have their status confirmed.Scotland\u0027s Health Secretary Jeane Freeman and her Welsh counterpart Vaughan Gething have urged UK Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes to reconsider, and have offered to host a pilot in Scotland and Wales in which relatives can take part.Ministers are calling for the families of EU nationals to be allowed to remain in the UK (Image: getty)Failure to do so would mean the ministers could not actively promote the pilot, they said.In a letter to Ms Nokes, the health secretaries said: We reiterate our view that the scheme as currently proposed is much more likely to deter, rather than to encourage, our EU staff from taking this opportunity to clarify their immigration status ahead of the UK leaving the EU on March 29 2019.We ask that you reconsider your decision not to include family members in the scheme.If you are amenable, and if your concerns are mainly about making the pilot cohort too large to manage, then we would be content to pilot the inclusion of family members in Scotland and Wales.If you are not able to agree to this, we would not feel comfortable actively promoting the scheme to health and social care staff in Wales and Scotland, although it is not our intention to oppose, or in any way to obstruct, the smooth operation of the scheme across the UK.A Home Office spokesman said: The EU Settlement Scheme will make it easy for EU citizens to get the status they need. In late August, we invited a small number of EU citizens to apply as part of the first testing phase to prove some of the functionality and processes.In order to ensure that the numbers of those involved in the testing remain controlled, family members of those applying during the private beta are not able to apply - unless they are themselves eligible through their employment with, or support from, the participating organisations.Family members of those granted status under the private beta can apply when the scheme is rolled out more widely.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Millions more are set to go onto Universal Credit in the coming months - as it continues its rollout across the country.But last week it was revealed that its set to be paused in order to try and fix some of the problems in the system - and more money could be pumped in to make sure that Brits don’t lose out.Many claimants say they don’t get their payments under the new system for many weeks after they are told they will - and end up being pushed into debt as a result.Some are forced into arrears on their rent and bills - and others have even had to resort to prostitution as a result, one MP said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000443139462.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"karren brady on women at work","story":"I wanted to stop her right there and ask: “What on earth are you sorry about  Why don’t you know your worth “Why don’t you have ­confidence in the contribution you make ”It left me wondering why so many talented and competent women lack confidence at work to get the best out of their job. Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The African plate is subdacting, going under, and the European plate we say itsabout cm a year.So all this middle and southern Mediterranean is a very active zone, so it has produced many earthquakes in historical times and in the present.We have stories collected from historical times from a large earthquake magnitude . offshore near Crete in AD which produced a tsunami and reached even Egypt.We have another in AD near Sicily, which devastated some cities in Sicily and caused a tsunami.Large scale earthquakes will continue to go ahead in Italy and Greece. But not only big earthquakes are associated with big risk.She cited last years . magnitude earthquake which struck central Italy as one example of a moderate tremor that can cause carnage.This hit on January  a few kilometres northwest of the town of LAquila, killing  people and laying waste to several ancient towns.She added: Risk comes even from moderate earthquakes, they tend to happen every five years in these countries. They are more frequent than large ones.Last year scientists said they expected an increase in earthquakes due to a tiny decrease in the speed of the planets rotation.A report presented at the Geological Society of America argued that five periods of intense seismic activity throughout history have followed periods of when the Earths rotation slowed.However, Segou did not believe the frequency of the tremors hitting Europe was increasing.Associate Professor of Earthquake Science in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne, Mark Quigley has previously told news.au central Italy is experiencing crustal extension.He says: Eastern central Italy is moving to the NE relative to Rome.As a result, this region experiences normal faulting earthquakes as the land is torn apart. The fault systems are short and structurally complex, so the earthquakes are not overly large by global standards.But because the earthquakes are shallow and structurally complex, and because many of the local towns and cities contain vulnerable buildings, strong shaking from these earthquakes has the potential to inflict major damage and loss of le in urban areas.Some  per cent occur around the rim of the Pacic Ocean.The plates - giant rock slabs that make up the Earths upper layer - are always slowly moving.They often collide and slide against each other, according to National Geographic.This impact can be unnoticeable on the surface but can cause immense stress between the plates.When this stress is released, it causes massive vibrations, called seismic waves, often hundreds of miles through the rock to the surface.There are fears that there is a big one on the way after a flurry of volcanic activity in the Pacics Ring of Fire.A study from Calornia says that the cluster of tremors around the planets so-called Ring of Fire- a horseshoe-shaped geological disaster zone - could indicate the big one is due to hit.The research, published in the journal Science Advances, involved analysis of  major earthquakes around the Pacic Ring of Fire between  and .Europe also has a number of volcanoes - some dormant, others active - which have in the past caused catastrophic events and huge loss of le.Among these is Mount Etna, on Sicily, which was first recorded erupting in BC, and has exploded around  times since.This last occurred in  when a BBC crew were pelted with boiling rocks and steam as they filmed the mountainside.Many in Europe also remember the  eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, in Iceland, which triggered huge air travel disruptions across western and northern Europe.Last year, researchers at the University of Leeds revealed the findings of a study which determined such ash cloud eruptions could occur once every  years.Co-author Dr Graeme Swindles said: In , when Eyjafjallajökull erupted, people were really shocked – it seemed to come completely out of the blue, but the eruption of Grímsvötn, the following year, was an extraordinary coincidence.Although it is possible that ash clouds can occur on an annual basis, the averageinterval for the last , years is around  years.The last time volcanic ash clouds affected northern Europe before the recent event was in ,  years ago – but aviation was much less intense at that time and it simply didnt have the same sort of impact.Our research shows that, over thousands of years, these sorts of incidents are not that rare – but people wondering how likely it is that the  chaos will be repeated in the next few years can feel somewhat reassured.Just this year alone the world has witnessed destructive eruptions in Hawaii, Bali and Guatemala.However, Clive Oppenheimer, professor of volcanology at the University of Cambridge, says there has not been an increase in volcanic activity.He told The : There have been quite a few eruptions in the news lately, so people question whether there’s an increase in rates of volcanism that we’re seeing just now, and this isn’t really the case.Eruptions are happening all the time - some make the news headlines and others don’t.If we look at the statistics back in time, the main thing we see is a reporting bias. There are not many eruptions during World War Two, for example, when people had other things to really worry about.So of course things will flare up in one place or another place and then it will be very much how those eruptions affect people and whereabouts in the world - whether that then becomes newsworthy."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000424503091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sewage drinking water thames bosses","story":"Thames Water said today the UKs capital will lose £ million a daydramatic measures arent put in place to save the citys water supply.The population of London is set to rise by two million people in the next  years which could lead to a million litre daily shortfall of water, made worse by climate change reducing natural resources.So Thames Water plans to open a reuse plant at the Deephams Sewage Treatment Works in North East London which will turn sewage into water clean enough to drink - a UK first, the Evening Standard reports.But the plant is not currently planned for everyday use - its intended for times of projected or actual drought.Discussions with the Environment Agency are ongoing about the viability of this plan.After plans to build a new £.billion reservoir in Oxfordshire were rejected by the government in , the plan is being revived by Thames Water.It is intended for water to be shipped down the Thames along the Oxford Canal to ensure taps keep flowing.The reservoir near Abingdon would play a vital role in supplying water to the South East.It will be complete by ,the government approves it.Thames Water also owns the UKs only desalination plant in Beckton, East London, which turns sea water into million litres of drinking water a day during drought.The company has a water resources management plan for the next  years which has budgeted £.billion until .A spokesperson said Thames Water is pledging to reduce leakage from its ,-mile network of pipes.He added: “More needs to be done to protect Londoners from the risk of severe drought.“Restrictions on water use in London alone could cost more than £million a day.”The reuse plant will put million litres of water a day back into the system by passing treated sewage through a desalination membrane to clean it.Its then mixed with reservoir water, treated again and pumped into the network.The spokesperson added: “We wouldn’t consider reusewe didn’t think the water would be good enough.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dad convinced telly possessed turns on weird messages","story":"Eerie footage captures the scene that unfolded after he checked his home surveillance equipment.At the beginning of the clip, all seems normal in the familys living room - until the television appears to switch itself on.It then flicks through several channels before the video cuts out.The footage, titled My TV turned on by itself was uploaded to Reddit.Recalling the spooky encounter the dad said: “This happened about five minutes after I locked the door and went to bed.‘My we, who is pregnant, was already in our room asleep.“There was no one  in the house – especially behind the curtains – and the remote has a full battery.”But other users were not convinced.One wrote:  [There] has to be a reasonable explanation.”Another claimed: “Maybe someone was messing with you from outside ”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CM-IMAGE-POO-MUZZ1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=710\" height=\"1298\" width=\"960","title":"mcdonalds human poo london newham","story":"Disgusted Ben Terry posted a picture of the human poo on the chains Facebook page.The image shows what appears to be a small piece of excrement lying on the toilet floor at the outlet in Forest Gate, Newham.Wet tissues are scattered beside it on the floor, which appears to be wet.Ben wrote: Actual human poo on the floor in Forest Gate McDonalds.

Among those are high profile former ministers including Amber Rudd and Iain Duncan Smith - the architect of the governments flagship welfare scheme. Ministers including Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns, Environment Minister George Eustice and Work and Pensions Minister Alok Sharma could also be rejected at the polls. Analysis by campaign group  degrees shows these constituencies have more people who could be moved onto Universal Credit - potentially losing them money - than the MPs majority. If just a fth of those affected are Conservative voters who switch their vote, the Conservative party could lose so many seats at any election they struggle to work even a minority government.  It comes as a public spending watchdog found Universal Credit is causing “unacceptable hardship” for many of its claimants. The Public Accounts Committee said the Tory “fortress mentality” is failing claimants who are struggling to adapt. Universal Credit, which is being rolled out gradually, replaces six existing benefits with a single payment - but critics have argued the programme, which has been subject to several delays, is flawed. A report by the Child Poverty Action Group suggests single parents face a cut in their income of pound, a year, families with two children could lose pound, on average and families with three children face a cut of pound,.Despite being the architect of UC, Iain Duncan-Smith has himself quit the Cabinet over welfare cuts and has demanded another poundbillion be pumped into Universal Credit to make it work. While former Tory PM Sir John Major has warned it could become Theresa Mays poll tax which sparked riots and helped lead to her downfall.

Ginette Lees, , had been stuck in traffic with her partner, Jason Jones, and three youngest children when they saw the bizarre sight. Her terried daughter, Gracie, cried out: Mummy, why hasnt he got a head  Ginette had to do a double take and decided to film the strange incident. Her eerie footage showed the apparently headless man walking along the pavement with a walking stick in one hand and a bag in the other.  She said: It was a very odd thing to see out of the blue. Its certainly not something you expect to see on your typical shopping trip. We had pulled up besides him at one point and had to wait for the traffic lights to change, but I still couldnt see his head. However, all was not as it seemed, and Ginette ensured she drove around him to show the children it was actually just an elderly man leaning on his walking stick.  She said: It took for us to drive past him to see that he did indeed have a head. After Gracie pointed him out, I have to admit I had to do a double take too. I jokingly said he has come out early for Halloween. We love Halloween in our family. I have three very excited kids ready to get dressed up. He hasnt given the kids any inspiration though - Oskah is being a monster again this year.  Ginette and her family had been out shopping last Saturday near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, when they spotted the elderly man. She explained: It was Saturday afternoon and we were driving through Huthwaite. We were going shopping with the children when Gracie goes mummy, why hasnt he got a head  They were stunned. We made a joke out of it and were all laughing. I didnt really want her to think there were headless men wandering around the streets, especially on the run up to Halloween with all the clowns and Michael Myers. I would say he was in his eighties, easily, and he was walking for ages - he was very slow. As we drove back up on our way back the kids were looking out for him.

But she refused to sign on, blaming confusion about her future and embarrassment about sponging. She told Manchester Evening News: “I was not claiming benefits because I didn’t want to be seen as sponging. I wanted to find my own way. “My nana said I just needed to find my feet. I knew I wanted to do something in public services. “I just ended up stayed at home and doing nothing. “I dragged it out. I was scared I was going to be judged. It became harder the longer it went on.” Aged , she started working in a department store, but hated the job and was confused about what to do next after dropping out of college. The situation lasted for a year, and it was only when a neighbour suggested she see a talent coach called Anthony Vanterpool that things began to change.  She said: “By the time I got in touch with him I was not confident at all. I was not where I wanted to be and I didn’t know how to get there.” He explained: She needed quite a bit of reassurance back then. “She was very fixated on not wanting to let people down and didn’t want to be put under pressure. “Between leaving college and meeting me something had sapped her confidence away. We lost all focus and direction and didn’t know where she wanted to go.” Together Anthony and Jordanna wrote up her CV and started to talk about her career options. In the end, it was an off-the-cuff comment that convinced Jordanna she could change her le. Anthony told her: All progress will place you outside your comfort zone. You are what you make yourself.” From then on Jordanna embarked on a health and social care course with the support of GM Talent Match, which forced her to mix with people of dferent ages and backgrounds and tackle any problems head on. “I was not quite sure how I would take to it but from day one I really enjoyed it,” she said. When Jordanna struggled with a classmate she decided to face up to the woman and confront the problem - something which has had a lasting impact.  She said: “I never would have been able to do that before. It was challenging but I faced up to it. “I always used to question myself and I didn’t like confrontation and when anything did happen I couldn’t face it head on.

She now has ambitions to become a paramedic herself. “This job is something I enjoy and it’s really rewarding,” Jordanna said. “It’s a challenge but it’s worth it. “But young people do need help. I do think to myself, ‘ I hadn’t had this help, where would I be today ’” Mr Vanterpool said a lot of young people he helps are held back by barriers, including illiteracy, poverty and mental health problems. He explained: “I think it’s a lot to do with peers and who you socialise with, plus your family network. “If you don’t have your own aspirations you may look at other people’s aspirations and then you find thats not what they really want. It’s about unpicking that. “A lot of it is down to that fear factor - fear of failure, being embarrassed andyou’ve not got anyone steering you it can be really dficult.” Unfortunately, the dficulties Jordanna faced in her teenage years are not uncommon. As such, Greater Manchester Talent Match is calling on local authorities to be better resourced to track young people past the mandatory age of . The Big Lottery-funded programme, which offers one-to-one, long-term support to unemployed young people, is due to end. Experts are applying for further funding but are worried young people will be left without support. “For a city region of Greater Manchester’s status and ambition, it isn’t acceptable to have young people fall through the cracks with their potential and ambitions unrealised,” Talent Match programme manager Marie Graham said. “These iniduals personal growth and fulfilment also has huge positive knock-on effects to communities and society as a whole.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry joined","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry joined by David and Romeo Beckham as they attend final day of Invictus GamesThe Duchess wore a power suit for the wheelchair basketball event, arrived to cheering crowds in Sydney as they took their seatsShareCommentsByRussell MyersAbigail OLeary:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video prince-harry-meghan-arrive-invictus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan Markle and Prince Harry are rounding off the last day of their Australia Royal Tour at the Invictus Games in Sydney - with the Duchess getting a cheeky kiss on the cheek.

The future king, , has revealed he let himself, Diana and the Royal Family down by going ahead with the doomed wedding despite his overwhelming doubts - which at one point reduced him to tears. The brutal bombshell was dropped by Robert Jobson, a royal reporter for nearly three decades, who has spent  months accompanying Charles on official tours around the world and has now written a book on the prince. Charles spent  years married to Diana. He proposed on February , , but Diana felt it was like a call to duty.  They wed at St Pauls Cathedral in London on July ,  and orced on August ,  - a year before the princess died. According to Jobson, alarm bells began to ring for Charles about Diana during the few meetings they had before tying the knot. He apparently realised they were not compatible when she burst into tears and would stare blankly at him when he spoke of what he had done during the day. The more he saw of Diana, the more the prince knew in his heart he had made a terrible mistake, Jobson wrote in the Daily Mail, which is serialising the new biography.  The author also claims the prince found Dianas alarming and irrational mood swings and temper impossible to deal with. Charles is said to have told pals: I desperately wanted to get out of the wedding in , when during the engagement I discovered just how awful the prospects were, having had no chance whatsoever to get to know Diana beforehand. But despite his overwhelming doubts and cold feet, Charles went ahead with the wedding - watched by  million. The decision is something he still regrets to this day and he has agonised over it for years, Jobson came to discover following conversations with the prince, people close to him, and inside sources.  Diana made no secret in the past that she too had second thoughts - claiming they had only met on  occasions before marrying. Prince Philip is also said to have expressed concerns over the relationship and told son Charles to either marry Diana or leave her. The couple went on to have children William and Harry, and Charles says he respects their love for their mother and the way they keep her memory alive.

Royal correspondent Robert Jobson, who has written the book, claims the prince knew within just a few meetings that the pair were ill-suited. Not just that but the -year-old told friends in the weeks up to the wedding that the more time he spent with her, the more he realised he was making a mistake but neither felt they could back out. He now admits he did not get to know Diana well enough - they met no more than  times - before their engagement in February .

Someone close to Diana lived hand-to-mouth with the Press An impeccable source for the book told Robert Jobson that there were unbelievable and pernicious lies aided and abetted by somebody rather close to me  who he believes lived hand-to-mouth with the Press.

Prince Charles has always insisted there is no truth to it.  There was no tryst on the royal train The most extraordinary and pernicious of these, Charles told a close friend  is that first of all I secreted Diana on board the royal train. The story, which circulated in November , three months before their engagement, caused a furore and is thought to have prompted the Duke of Edinburgh to write to Prince Charles urging him to wed or leave Diana.

Further twisting of the story in the years to come would see the tryst with Diana replaced with a secret rendezvous with Camilla - also untrue. Camilla was not smuggled into Buckingham Palace on his wedding night And there was no truth that Camilla - now the Duchess of Cornwall - was smuggled into Buckingham Palace the night before his wedding to Diana on July  . He told a friend: The idea that this could have happened and that I could have done any such thing is beyond belief, and yet this monstrous nonsense has persisted.  Other stories which he labels either a lie or an invention are claims Camilla was pelted with bread rolls by shoppers in a store in Chippenham, Wiltshire. Bread rolls thrown at Camilla in Chippingham It was in  that the BBC enraged the Prince of Wales when a story online called Camilla the woman who has in the past suffered such indignities as having bread rolls thrown at her by Diana fans. The story was regurgitated in The Dailysix years later and every time it is repeated Prince Charles is riled.  The truth is that it was a media exercise which involved actresses throwing bread rolls at one another, with a lookalike actress employed. Charles has also railed against the image of him being so pampered that he had toothpaste squeezed onto the brush for him. Toothpaste squeezed onto brush for him At a royal dinner one night Robert Jobson was sat next to Michael Fawcett, the Princes former valet and supposed toothpaste squeezer. The story is not true, said Mr Fawcett, and it still irks Charles.

On her coronation in , the Queen promised to serve her country for the rest of her le. But it has long been speculated that Prince Charles could reign as a regent sooner than expected. Now, in revelations in a new book by veteran royal correspondent Robert Jobson, its suggested the Queen could pass on her duties as monarch when she reaches , reports Mail Online . Earlier this year, Charles was appointed the Queens successor as Head of the Commonwealth - currently made up of fty-three sovereign states.  In a speech at Buckingham Palace to leaders of the commonwealth, the Queen said: It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity to future generations, and will decide that one day the Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in . The royal familys has had one famous abdication - that of Edward VIII, the Queens Uncle. His stepping down from the throne was one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the royal family, with the Queens father George V becoming monarch. Despite rumours of the Queen stepping back, royal commentator Richard Fitziwilliams told Express the abdication of the -year-old monarch’s uncle Edward VIII “haunted” the royal family and Elizabeth II remains committed to her duty to the nation. He said although Charles’s “whole le has been a preparation for kingship”, the Queen will want succession to occur “naturally.  Other revelations in the new royal biography include details on Charless alleged worries about marrying Princess Diana and how he knew it was a massive mistake. The future king, , has revealed he let himself, Diana and the Royal Family down by going ahead with the doomed wedding despite his overwhelming doubts - which at one point reduced him to tears. The brutal bombshell was dropped by Robert Jobson, a royal reporter for nearly three decades, who has spent  months accompanying Charles on official tours around the world and has now written a book on the prince.  Charles spent  years married to Diana. He proposed on February , , but Diana felt it was like a call to duty. They wed at St Pauls Cathedral in London on July ,  and orced on August ,  - a year before the princess died . According to Jobson, alarm bells began to ring for Charles about Diana during the few meetings they had before tying the knot. He apparently realised they were not compatible when she burst into tears and would stare blankly at him when he spoke of what he had done during the day.  The more he saw of Diana, the more the prince knew in his heart he had made a terrible mistake, Jobson wrote in the Daily Mail , which is serialising the new biography. The author also claims the prince found Dianas alarming and irrational mood swings and temper impossible to deal with. Charles is said to have told pals: I desperately wanted to get out of the wedding in , when during the engagement I discovered just how awful the prospects were, having had no chance whatsoever to get to know Diana beforehand. But despite his overwhelming doubts and cold feet, Charles went ahead with the wedding - watched by  million. The decision is something he still regrets to this day and he has agonised over it for years, Jobson came to discover following conversations with the prince, people close to him, and inside sources.

Heulwen Ebsworth, a beautul, vibrant -year-old, died suddenly from a brain —aneurysm in  when her three daughters were still teenagers. “When the doctors asked us about donating my mum’s shyorgans, all I could feel was fury,” wrote Rhian, who was then just . “It was the most painful moment of my le.” Heulwen wasn’t registered as an organ donor but her shyfamily knew she would want to help others and agreed.

And that knowledge will comfort her forever. “I had no idea,” I said after reading the piece. “Well, it’s not something that comes up in conversation,” she replied.

Iraq got bombed back to the Stone Age. North Korea was invited to tea. Into the void where the Axis of Evil once terried the world, a new existential threat to civilisation has been born. And it has a spire  metres tall. Unbeknown to the , tourists who visit it each year, it seems that Salisbury Cathedral is built on an inter-dimensional whirlpool which sucks evil down towards hell like sand in an hour-glass. The presence of these unwitting pilgrims, walking widdershins around the cloisters, merely speeds up the spiritual centruge.Hence the bemusement of Russian spies who, on an entirely-heterosexual visit under  names to the East End of London, found themselves dragged towards the bewitching building. They broke free of its unearthly tractor beam only when they dropped a bottle of perfume that Ruslan had bought as a gt for his mother, and was unfortunately past its sell-by date.Caught in the Salisbury swirl, the liquid mutated into a battlefield nerve agent with unforeseen deadly consequences when it was dropped on the doorstep of a building that happened to be home to a Russian defector. They didnt get to see the spire. Which is a shame, because theyd heard it was the tallest in Britain.  The vortex is felt across the world. It drew a team of  assassins from Riyadh to Istanbul, where CCTV was disabled when an unfortunate journalist tripped and fell over a discarded bone saw, several times, and then cut off his own face and thew it down a well. It also compelled his accidental murderers to flee before the Turkish authorities could persuade them to headbutt a bullet, develop a sexual attraction to mincers, or perhaps most suicidally of all, announce they were taking up careers as journalists.The evil eddy even forced an otherwise-gentle and liberal soul entirely in tune with st century social norms to scream UGLY BLACK B******! at a Windrush migrant.The more cynical corners of the internet have whispered that Ryanair flights are the twisted children of Salisburys malevolent maelstrom, producing miniaturised tides of despair and misery, but the companys official ouija board insists in the face of all the evidence that it is just a coincidence.  Now it appears Salisburys undertow to the underworld has drawn someone all the way into the cathedral itself, there to smash two holes in the specially-toughened glass box in which lies one of only  remaining original copies of the Magna Carta.At time of writing no-one has been charged in relation to the Get Carta incident, but there are three madcap theories of who could be responsible:. A grammarist insistent on adding the definite article to the documents customary description, becausethe is written on the bloody thing people cant not use it . The ruler of a nation in political crisis who wants to add a th clause stating Brexit means Brexit on the basisthey didnt know what it meant in the th century she cannot be blamed for making it up as she goes along in the st . Nicholas Cage on one of his many flights of fancy, trying to crack a hidden medieval code that links the Founding Fathers to Jesus secret lovechild, whose ultimate descendant turns out to be Indiana Jones dad.  Of course, thats all ridiculous, isnt it  As mad as finding someone in Old Sarum wants planning permission for an underground shark tank, or that Kim Jong Un has moved his embassy to Middle Wallop. Or genuinely thinking that because both Porton Down and a village called Palestine are in the vicinity, Salisbury must be on speed-dial to the Devil himself. There are no forces of evil. Salisbury is no more be a wormhole to the netherworld than it is a coral atoll in the South Pacic. Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta was too dumb to realise it was alarmed, it would disentegrate within  minutes and would be harder to sell on than Philip Greens used undercrackers. Evil is a supernatural force which means some people are born beyond redemption - destined for corruption and amorality, and liablecaught to be crucied, electried, poisoned or shot because theyre something other than human. But evil is just an excuse.Humans are merely bad. They make bad decisions and do bad things, making bad excuses along the way. Vladimir Putin ordered the elaborately-dficult murder of Sergei Skripal because he thought the defector was evil, and evil deserves the effort. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia ordered the elaborately-messy murder of Jamal Kashoggi for the same reason. And people like the Ryanair racist arent evil, either. Theyre angry, ignorant, unsocialised outcasts, often sick and usually screaming at the world for not being nicer to them. When we say something is evil we refuse to take responsibility. We say it was out of our hands when the Twin Towers fell or the policeman was kned or the terrorists got through. We dont say: How did we make that terrorist  Why dont we spend money on people who do bad stuff  What has to change before we accept that guy other there goes to the toilet just like I do Whoever tried to steal the Magna Carta, whoever is sending bombs to Donald Trumps enemies, whoever strokes Tommy Robinsons cancerous ego is not evil. Theyre us, with a few things gone wrong. A lost job, a last straw, a loose wire.If we stop saying its evil -we stop saying maybe thats just Salisbury for you - we might be able to fix it.

The picture, obtained by the Mirror and taken in Las Vegas, reveals the billionaire in his pomp before his name was dragged into a string of scandals. As we today tracked down Green to Arizona, there were demands for the tycoon to be stripped of his knighthood. He is facing calls to drop his injunction preventing reporting of a string of gagging orders signed by former staff, who allege he bullied and sexually and racially harassed them. Three months after he launched a pound, legal bid to silence the , Green issued a statement this week in which he insisted: “I categorically and wholly deny these allegations”.  The Las Vegas photograph shows Green wearing one of his much-loved fancy dress outfits, a frilly shirt unbuttoned to the waist, with the unidentied young woman at his side. It was allegedly taken in the Bellagio Hotel on Halloween in . An onlooker told the Mirror: “It was early evening when I saw Sir Philip leaving the Bellagio with two young women. “It was Halloween and everyone dresses up in America, so it seemed normal. He was clearly off to aand got into a car. “There was no sign of Lady Green. He was holding this woman close and clearly enjoying himself.”  Tonight Green appeared to be lying low after being named in Parliament as the businessman behind the injunction. The Mirror spotted the Topshop tycoon’s poundmillion private jet parked discreetly at Tucson International Airport in Arizona. Green was seen talking on his mobile as he strolled in the US state.A source said: “It’s no secret Phil’s love of Arizona. He gushes about the place.  “It has year-round sun and allows him to escape the stresses of his business. “Whenever troubled has flared before he has been known to head to Tucson, leaving behind his place in Monaco or his yachts.Normally where ever his Gulfstream is, Phil is not far away.” The Gulfstream GER had left Las Vegas on Sunday destined for the Arizona city, but as it was making its approach it erted to Los Angeles.  Little more than  hours later, at .am on Monday, it left LAX to make the -minute journey to Tucson. Green’s aircraft is described as the “holy grail of private jets”. It can fly non-stop from Hong Kong to New York. It was delivered in , weeks before the Green family’s Lionheart superyacht arrived.The vessel is understood to have cost poundmillion. Green, often snapped with A-listers such as the late Dirty Dancing actor Patrick Swayze, has a transport collection that also includes a speedboat, a helicopter and other yachts.  He is a regular in Tucson, where he visits the Canyon Ranch wellness resort at the foot of Santa Catalina Mountains. It thought he used the retreat during the BHS scandal. In  he sold the chain to investors with no retail experience. A year later it went to the wall with , job losses and a poundmillion pension fund black hole. Meanwhile the #MeToo scandal continued to swirl around Green today. A hashtag of pinknotgreen swept across social media, with calls for a boycott of Green’s shops, including Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton.On Thursday, ex-Labour minister Peter Hain told the House of Lords he felt it was his “duty” to name Green due to the “serious and repeated” nature of allegations. He told Parliament he had “been contacted by someone intimately involved in the case of a powerful businessman using non-disclosure agreements and substantial payments to conceal the truth about serious and repeated sexual harassment, racist abuse and bullying”. A barrister claimed Lord Hain’s conduct was “completely improper”, but the peer said it was “the right thing to do”. He later told BBC Newsnight: “I considered it extremely seriously before I said it. I’m discharging myas a parliamentarian, and what concerned me about this case was wealth, and power that comes with it, and abuse.”  Parliamentary privilege protects MPs or peers from being prosecuted over statements made in the Commons or Lords. Green said after Lord Hain named him: “I am not commenting on anything that has happened in court or was said in Parliament today. “To the extent that it is suggested that I have been guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour, I categorically and wholly deny these allegations. “These settlements are confidential so I cannot comment further on them.” Thespent eight months investigating accusations against the tycoon. But on Tuesday the newspaper was prevented from revealing the existence of non-disclosure deals by a interim injunction issued by the Court of Appeal. Women and Equalities Select Committee chair Maria Miller, who has called for reform of such deals, today suggested it was time to “consider whether NDAs are actually outlawed”. She added: “Unfortunately they’ve become so misused that some feel they can do anything as long as they can afford to pay for the victims’ silence, and that is no way for our legal system to work.” "},{"url":null,"title":"student seen struggling stand hours","story":"NewsStudent seen struggling to stand hours before death at boozy university initiation where he downed  vodkasEdward Farmer, , had been taking part in an Agricultural Society initiation event in December , where he may have had up to  shots of vodka in less than three hoursShareCommentsByAbigail OLearyHannah Graham:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video cctv-captures-ed-farmers-final-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA student was captured on CCTV struggling to stand hours before he died at a boozy university initiation ceremony. Edward Farmer, from Leicestershire, had been taking part in an Agricultural Society initiation event in December , where he had up to  shots of vodka in less than three hours. The -year-old, a Newcastle University Fresher, died due to the toxic effects of an excessive amount of alcohol in a short period of time, according to an inquest. Edwards death sent shockwaves through the university, which has now banned initiation ceremonies, reports ChronicleLive . The ceremonies are often carried out when freshers join a new society and usually involve drinking large quantities of alcohol. At Newcastle University, most students ChronicleLive approached had heard about the Mr Farmers death, and have seen stories about the inquest over recent days. All agree that it is shocking - one calls the story terrying.  One man said his flatmate is a member of the Agricultural Society, the group which organised the initiation which ended in Mr Farmers death. Theyve all been warned about it, he said. Music student Holly Clarke said it had been a shock to hear about the tragedy, which didnt line up with her experience at university at all. I honestly thought it was an American thing that happened in frat houses there, or maybe at Oxbridge - it doesnt seem like something that would have happened here, she said. I havent experienced anything like it. Its terrying that something like that could happen. Drink and death with students, it feels completely unheard of, and the fact that it was through an initiation process worries me. I think part of it is that with new students theres this idea that youve got to go out and get drunk, thats part of the culture, and thats not just Newcastle. People are being inserted into a new environment, they want to fit in and make friends and the way they do that is by drinking - freshers are socially expected to drink a lot. Newcastle University officially bans initiations to its student societies. The university website warns anyone found to have organised or participated in an initiation ritual will be subject to disciplinary action, saying the events encourage excessive drinking, force humiliating and degrading behavior, and may bring the institution into disrepute.  Speaking at the inquest, however, Lesley Braiden, academic registrar at Newcastle University, said it was dficult,not impossible, to monitor initiation events. The group of lads who met with the Chronicle, who admit to having some experience of initiations, therefore ask to remain anonymous. Now studying for masters degrees, most of them completed their undergraduate at Newcastle, when several of them participated in the events as freshers. However, they said they dont recognise some of the more shocking challenges mentioned in Mr Farmers inquest - apple bobbing in urine or drinking from a pigs head - and they dont think the initiations are a more general problem for the university. One man said: A lot of sport societies have initiations, a lot of first years get excessively drunk and do silly challenges. What happened is awful - when someone gets to that stage thats when you stop and make sure theyre alright. But the way its being portrayed makes it sound like its a problem with our student culture in general. Its being made into a bit of a witch-hunt against Newcastle and societies. You cant say its completely safe, but when students take part, theyre  and they choose to do it. You might be egged on but youre not forced to drink. The group listed the activities theyd think of as being involved in initiations, saying it is mostly drinking games, and some times tasting unpleasant non-alcoholic things. Youd pour spirits into a football boot and drink them, or do shots of something thats a bit disgusting, one said. When asked about the university ban on initiations, the students were only vaguely aware of it.  A third man said: You get emails, but I dont think anybody is really going to listen to it - theyd just call them something . While these students admitted to having experienced initiations, and one witness at Mr Farmers inquest said they were widespread, most of those wandering around campus who agreed to speak said it was not something theyd come across. Fourth year chemical engineering student Jono Morley said: I havent experienced anything like that. I think its just sports teams, although Ive got friends on sports teams whove never done anything like that. He agreed there was a culture of heavy drinking more generally, but not more so than in other universities or cities. I would say most students here are the same as at any other university: its just students being students. For third year psychology student Charlotte White, this drinking culture felt alienating as a fresher - so she started up the Newcastle University Sober Socials society. Teetotal Charlotte was keen to take part in activities which didnt centre around drinking, but found most of the activities organised by university clubs seemed to involve going out. She founded the society, now in its second year, for drinkers and non-drinkers alike who wanted a club whose social activities didnt focus on boozing. The really friendly group go out for coffee, bowling, or host sober film nights. I tried to find societies I could feel comfortable in but a lot of them would only offer club nights, she said. In Freshers Week they do put on some non-drinking events but after that its just sort of expected thatyou want to socialise you go out drinking.  People are expected even before they go to uni to drink a lot as freshers - family members would say to me oh, Newcastle, theres great night le there so theres a sense you have to take advantage of that. There can be a pressure to drink: a lot of friends have come to me and said I wish I could say no but they feel likethey want to go and make friends they have to pretend they are really up for it. The -year-old, who is also studying drinking culture in universities as part of her academic work, says that pressure can also extend to the amount drunk: theres a sense that students should not just drink, but get drunk. People say oh, Ill come out for one but friends say have another, Ill buy you one, evenyoure trying to control it and be sensible it doesnt happen. Theyre trying to make sure everyone has fun, but that means drinking. Newcastle University registrar, Dr John Hogan, said: Ed’s death was a great tragedy which shocked us all and we would once again like to express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Initiations are banned at Newcastle University and it is made clear to all clubs and societies that any such events constitute serious misconduct.  Since Ed’s death we have already made a number of changes to the way we raise awareness among our students about the risks of alcohol and how they keep themselves and their fellow students safe. However, having listened to the evidence we will be reflecting carefully on all that we have learnt at the inquest and looking at whether there are areas where we can improve what we do. Over the last four days we have been shocked to hear some of the details of what took place that night and do not condone this sort of behaviour in any way. Following our disciplinary investigations a number of students were found to be in breach of University rules and appropriate inidual sanctions were imposed. The Students’ Union also took action against the society involved. The welfare and safety of all our students are of paramount importance to us and together with the Students’ Union we work hard to help them stay safe during their time at university. On behalf of the University, I would once again like to express to Ed’s family and loved ones our deepest sorrow about the loss of a young man of such potential who surely had a bright future ahead of him.

The -year-old, who is accused of sending pipe bombs to critics of President Donald Trump, warned the power company it would be worse than September th, according to a  police report. His extensive rap sheet also includes arrests for domestic violence, theft and fraud. Sayoc, a former stripper, showed flashes of violent anger and posted vitriolic screeds online. In recent months, Sayoc, a registered Republican, railed against Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on Facebook.  He also posted venomous broadsides against George Soros on Twitter, posting one tweet on Wednesday, two days after he allegedly mailed a bomb to the liberal philanthropists home. Hours after he was arrested in Plantation, Florida, on Friday, his social media posts and peripatetic work history began to offer the first sketch of a man whose rudimentary bombs launched a nationwide manhunt. Sayoc has been charged by the FBI after  explosives were sent to top Democrats including the Clintons and Obamas. He is accused of five federal crimes, the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed tonight during a press conference. He faces up to  years in prisonfound guilty.  Sayocs white van, which was seized by authorities, had numerous pro-Trump stickers featuring the President and Vice President Mike Pence, as well as a CNN SUCKS sign. The van also had photos of Clinton and other Democrats with bullseyes superimposed on their faces.  David Cypkin, , a documentary filmmaker, recalled seeing the van parked outside a shopping center near his home for more than a year and as recently as this summer. It often had an open door or an open window, which led me believe there was somebody inside, Cypkin said in a phone interview. It stayed overnight. I saw it dozens of times.  Sayocs social media accounts are filled with anti-Democrat sentiments and racist diatribes. Two Twitter accounts that appear to belong to Sayoc are largely made up of retweeted posts condemning prominent Democrats, including Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for Florida governor, and Soros. Two weeks ago, Sayoc threatened a former Democratic congressional spokeswoman on Twitter after her appearance on Fox News. The tweet warned her to hug your loved ones real close every time you leave home.  The woman, Rochelle Ritchie, reported him to Twitter, but the company found he had not violated any conduct rules. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment, citing an ongoing law enforcement investigation. A Facebook profile that appeared to belong to Sayoc featured videos and photos of him at multiple Trump rallies, including at least one in Florida. Several posts contained anti-Muslim statements.  Sayoc attended Bred College in North Carolina and the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and played soccer for both schools, though he did not graduate either one, according to school representatives. From  to , he worked as a male exotic dancer for Gold Productions Inc, according to a company employee. Sayoc left to pursue a professional wrestling career and later started his own company. He is a promoter, booking agent and live entertainment owner, according to his LinkedIn profile. He filed for bankruptcy in Miami in , according to court records. At the time, Sayoc said he lived with his mother and had recently left a store manager job that paid less than , a year. He listed a , tax refund and a  Chevy Tahoe vehicle as his only assets.  His LinkedIn page said he was pursuing veterinary medicine at High Point University in North Carolina, but a school spokesman said he did not attend the school. One of his Twitter accounts said he worked at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel  Casino in Florida, but the Seminole Tribe of Florida, which owns the casino, said it could find no evidence to confirm that.  FBI director, Christopher Wray, announced that  explosive devices had been sent to iniduals. Sayocs fingerprints were found on a package sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters, Wray said. And he didnt rule out there being other packages. But he added: We do believe weve got the right guy. The FBI tweeted: The FBI can confirm we have one person in custody. There will be a press conference in Washington DC at the Department of Justice at :pm ET.  The explosive devices were sent to top Democrats, former senior US officials and prominent critics of President Donald Trump. Trump this afternoon praised the FBI for finding the suspect and compared it to a needle in a haystack job. He said: I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody. Its an incredible job by law enforcement. These terrorising acts are despicable and have no place in our country. And we will prosecute them, him, her, whoever it may be to the fullest extent of the law. He went on to say how Americans must uny and show the world they are united in peace and harmony. It comes as police found two suspicious packages earlier today addressed to US Senator Cory Booker and James Clapper, the former US director of national intelligence.  All the people targeted have often been maligned by right-wing critics. They included Democratic Party donor George Soros, former President Barack Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden, and former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said that at least five of the packages bore aaddress from the Florida office of US Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee. There has been an outcry from Trumps critics, who claimed that his inflammatory rhetoric against Democrats and the press has created a climate for politically motivated violence.  After first calling for unity and civil discourse on Wednesday, Trump lashed out again Thursday at the hateful media. His supporters accused Democrats of unfairly suggesting the president was to blame for the bomb scare.

Trump said on Twitter.  Authorities believe the packages, which were intercepted before reaching their intended recipients, all went through the US Postal Service at some point, a source said. None detonated and no one has been hurt. The devices were thought to have been fashioned from bomb-making designs widely available on the internet, a federal law enforcement source told Reuters. Still, investigators are treating the devices as live explosives, not a hoax, said James ONeill, the New York City police commissioner. Investigators have declined to say whether the devices were built to be al. Bomb experts and security analysts say that based on their rudimentary construction it appeared they were more likely designed to sow fear rather than to kill.  The parcels each consisted of a manila envelope with a bubble-wrap interior containing potentially destructive devices, the FBI said. Each was affixed with a computer-printed address label and six US Forever postage stamps, the agency said. Two packages were sent both to Waters and Biden. Others who received the bombs were former Attorney General Eric Holder, former CIA director John Brennan, US Representative Maxine Waters of Calornia, and actor Robert De Niro.

But inspiration soon struck and she came up with a creative way to show him how she felt.  Mattea Goff from Texas has been up late into the night breastfeeding her five-month-old daughter Aurora - while her husband Kris sleeps next to her. The mum-of-two, who also has a five-year-old called Seleste, has been feeling rather irritable first thing, so she decided to draw a series of pictures revealing why. She shared her drawings on Facebook and theyve quickly gone viral. Alongside the cartoons, she wrote: So this past weekend I was having a hard time finding the wordsto express to Kris why Im not in the best of moods first thing in the morning. So I sat down with my coffee and drew him a visual.  The images show the couple in bed, with their baby in a cot beside them. The baby wakes up in the middle of the night, needing to be fed, but then while Mattea is taking care of her, the infant begins slapping and clawing at her mothers chest. She then vomits on her parents bed. Because of all thats going on, Mattea ends up staying up all night with the baby. Her partner on the other hand is shown enjoying a full night of sleep - with his useless nipples.  More than , people have liked the mums Facebook post, with over , sharing it. There are also , comments on the drawings, many being from fellow mums who could relate to the hilarious images. One person said: Right    How the F do they sleep through that  Another wrote: This is the perfect illustration.  A third added: Oh Ive been there many times. Speaking to Buzzfeed, Mattea said: My husband is a fantastic guy, but sometimesyou havent lived something, you dont understand it. Ive given my husband drawings before, but this particular set of drawings came from my lack of sleep and my desire to get my point across. I think these drawings really resonate with mums because the exhaustion is hard to explain to someone who hasnt lived it.

The unfortunate pooch, called Ruckus, has a history of trying to play with the prickly animals. But he came off worse this time, with hundreds of porcupine spines embedded in his face, nose and mouth. Shocked vets at the Lollypop Farm animal shelter had to painstakingly remove each one. And, incredibly, the animal has now made a full recovery from his encounter. A spokesman for the shelter said: Ruckus was surrendered to Lollypop Farm so that he could receive treatment for the quills that were stuck into his jowls, face, and inside of his mouth. His previous owners indicated that Ruckus had an unfortunate history of going after porcupines. Ruckus wasn’t the first, and won’t be the last pup to lose a fight with a porcupine.  Porcupines can have more than , quills and will release them into the face of a potential threat. The shelter said: Ruckus was treated by the veterinary team here at Lollypop Farm, who quickly worked to detach the quills from around and inside of his mouth. The tips of porcupine quills that puncture the skin are actually shaped like a tiny fish hook, and can be very dficult to remove. Luckily for Ruckus, our team was able to safety remove all of the quills, and this big pup was feeling better in no time at all. The huge hound now has a new owner too after being adopted by a local dog-lover.

The secret corridor, leading to a chamber beneath the Pyramid of the Moon at Teotihuacaacuten, has been discovered by archaeologists. They say it was probably used for rituals relating to the underworld and a treasure trove of human remains along with strange artacts could be found inside. The tunnel,  feet beneath the ancient ruins, was initially made following a scan of the area last year. And investigators from the National Institute of Anthropology and History said the ritual space may have simulated travelling into the underworld after death.Veronica Ortega, the director of the Project of Integral Conservation of Plaza de la Luna, said this week: Previous explorations found skeletons of iniduals with cranial deformation, as in the Mayan area, and erse green stone objects . So it is not dficult to think that something similar could be found in the subsoil.  The tunnel is located to the south of the Plaza de la Luna, but it is likely that there is another entrance to the east side. He said investigations into the tunnel and cavity could also reveal the pyramids links to other regions, MailOnline reported. Dr Ortega said: Whats found inside could help to unravel the relationships that this ancient metropolis had with other regions of Mesoamerica.  Scans were made using electric resistivity, a radical technique which creates an image of the subsurface. The tunnel was found towards the south of the Plaza de la Luna - a central square believed to have been used for human sacrices in front of crowds of up to ,. And experts now believe there could be another entry to the east.  The Temple of the Moon is the second-largest temple in Teotihuacan, after the Temple of the Sun. Its structure existed prior to  AD, experts say, while the city of Teotihuacan is thought to date back to around  BCE. In ancient times, Teotihuacan become one of the largest ancient settlements in the Americas with at least , inhabitants.Built by a pre-Columbian civilisation it was eventually occupied by the Aztecs. But, despite extensive study of the area, archaeologists have never been able to find the remains of any of the citys rulers.

step closer to creating a pound. million regional tennis centre despite some strong opposition.Last Thursday, the care, learning and housing committee voted overwhelmingly in favour of proceeding with an applicationto the next funding round on November .The project is backed by Sport Scotland, Tennis Scotland and the Lawn Tennis Association with proposals that would see funding come from a grant of up to pound million from the Transforming Scottish Indoor Tennis Fund .However, this falls short of the total needed and will leave the council and High Le Highland, the charity which provides leisure services across the region, to source a further half a million pounds.Councillor Andrew Jarvie tabled an amendment opposing the move saying he was \"annoyed\" because he felt the priority should have been replacing \"past it\" mobile librariesthat would better serve the whole region.Mr Jarvie said: \"I just struggle to connect the dots at a time when we struggle to protect the services that we do have ndash how are we then going on and investing in new services  It seems not the right way to do it.\"He added the \"Inverness-centric project\" would be of benefit to the \"inner Moray Firth area only.\"Councillor Richard Laird said he was \"a little bit peeved\" at the lack of detail.He said: \"I donrsquot know whether I support proposals for a tennis centre in Inverness until I have seen the business case, how much it would cost to run and how much it would generate. This proposal is back to front.\"Despite the objections there was enough support within the committee to push the bid forward to the application stage with a future review to be undertaken on the business case.Brigitte Johnson, whose daughter plays tennis, attended the council in support of the move along with five others.She said: \"Currently the issue in Highland is that we donrsquot have any indoor facilities, so kids, adults, anyone who wants to get involved have to travel down the A to Stirling or Gleneagles ndash a long way to go for a game of tennis.\"Ross Lyon , an S pupil at Fortrose Academy and an avid tennis player believes an indoor facility would greatly benefit young people in the north.He said: \"Most tournaments in the winter are indoors down south so having indoor courts up here will allow me to improve and also give me a chance to play all year round which means that I wouldnrsquot fall behind others from the central belt.\"It would help young kids get into the sport who donrsquot want to play in negative one degrees on a sodden Tuesday night.\"Saturday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"winger wright determined to celebrate reds win on field and not in stands","story":"Scott Wright witnessed the incredible scenes of celebration when Aberdeen ended their trophy drought in .Now he wants to play his part in restoring the League Cup to the Pittodrie trophy cabinet.In March  the Dons ended a -year wait for silverware when they beat Inverness Caley Thistle on penalties at Parkhead to win the League Cup.Wright, , was in his first year as a full-time player with the Reds and was at the final along with , other Dons fans.Now Wright is likely to be involved tomorrow when Aberdeen play Rangers looking to get into another League Cup final.Having witnessed the joy after the Reds’ last League Cup win, the winger wants to play a part in repeating the feat this season.Wright said: “I remember going to the cup final when we won.“That was my first year, full-time, at the club and I remember going down with a couple of the other Under- lads to final.“The buzz that was around the whole city – not just the club – was incredible at that time.“I’d love to be properly involved in something like that.“I was still too young to be involved in the celebrations afterwards but I know the boys will have had a good night.“Now, though, the focus is on tomorrow and getting a result. You can use the past as inspiration but it’s the present we’re most concerned with.”As a local boy and Dons fan all his days, Wright, from Balmedie, knows what it means to the Red Army to reach cup finals and win silverware.In tomorrow’s last-four clash with the Gers, the Aberdeen support will be outnumbered by their counterparts from Govan – but Wright is determined to deliver a performance to savour to propel the Reds into another cup final. He added: “I know how much it means to the fans to get to cup finals and win trophies, with me being a fan myself.“Sometimes that means I need to take more of a step back and not get caught up in the occasion and properly assess things.“On the other hand, I know how much it means and all the boys in the dressing room know how much it means to the fans.“Whoever we play in the semi-final we would go out and give it our all.“We know the fans are going to be outnumbered but they will make a good noise because they always do and hopefully we can repay them with a good performance.“Rangers have had a great start to the season and we know it’s going to be a dficult game but we knowwe play our game right then we can give them a good game.”Aberdeen’s start to the season has been patchy with  points amassed from nine league games, which has left them seventh in the Premiership.Although not happy with the start to the campaign, Wright believes it will look completely dferentthey can reach the League Cup final.He said: “We’ve been a bit up and down, we’ve had some draws and some wins and also a couple of losses.“I’ve said in the past that there is a famous thing at the club under the gaffer where we go on winning runs. It can be eight or nine games on the trot and there’s no reason for us not to be able to do that again this season.“If that starts on Sunday then it’s brilliant and we take it from there.“If we win on Sunday we’re in a cup final and you look at our start to the season and it’s a lot better.”Wright has appeared once before at Hampden but it was the briefest of cameos at the end of the Scottish Cup final in  as the Dons chased an equaliser following Tom Rogic’s injury-time strike for Celtic.After ing from injury in last Saturday’s - loss to Hearts at Tynecastle, Wright would like to have a bigger role tomorrow.He said: “I would love to play a bit more this timeI can because Hampden is a great ground.“I’d love to think I might be in with a chance of starting.“It’s totally up to the manager whether he sees me fit to play from the start or whether he sees me featuring from the bench.“Whatever suits the team is fine with me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/Fingers_Holding_Virto_B_HiRes.jpg ","title":"get a hearing health check so surprises dont sneak up on you","story":"We regularly go for eye tests and check ups to make sure that our vision is up to par. But how many of us do the same for our hearing For Duncan and Todd’s Head of Audiology, Alex Higgins, ear health and hearing are his absolute priorities. And that means that no two days are the same.He explained: “Although a lot of our appointments are similar – we do hearing tests and screenings, fitting of hearing aids and follow-up appointments, as well as health checks and removal of wax or foreign objects – the reasons our patients come to us can y.“While most people experience the normal age-related deterioration of hearing, there can also be hereditary conditions or illnesses or environmental factors that can damage ears and affect hearing.”Alex, who joined Duncan and Todd when they expanded their optical business to include hearing care last year, explained that many people first experience a loss of high tones, which can make sounds less clear.“People experiencing this will think that the TV isn’t being clear or people are mumbling, which isn’t the case. But they have lost the definition in the sound.”Unlike the hearing aids of old, new technology means that hearing aids are much smaller and discreet, so it’s not immediately obvious that someone is wearing one. vw, px\"  “We all remember the big ‘beige bananas’ that would sit on the ear and you could hear it whistling sometimes,” Alex recalled. “But they are nothing like that these days. Those were just sound ampliers and were very simplistic, but today’s hearing aids can do so much more.”Alex added that this can be part of the reason why people don’t get their hearing checked.“There is still the stigma of wearing a large hearing aid, as well as people not wanting to admit that they are struggling to hear. But as more people get checked, we are seeing it have positive impact.“In cases of dementia, there are several studies that show lack of hearing in patients compounds the problem and improving hearing not only re-stimulates the brain but improves the ability to join in more challenging listening environments, improving quality of le and leading to less isolation.”Like glasses, hearing aids now work around your prescription and needs. While cosmetically they are small, the amount of technology packed into the units means that they can adapt to specic requirements, whether it’s connecting to your mobile phone so you can use the phone handsfree, connecting to your smart TV so that you can hear your favourite programmes perfectly, or even with built-in tinnitus maskers to block out unwanted noises. vw, px\"  Alex added: “There are even hearing aids that you can use in ears that are completely deaf. They work with the non-deaf ear and tricks your brain into thinking you are hearing in both ears.”And every six months, patients come back to Duncan and Todd to have their hearing aids and ears checked to seeany changes are needed.For those who aren’t in need of a hearing aid, an annual check can ensure that any hearing issues that may arise are caught quickly and before too much deterioration can occur.Alex said: “Audiology is essentially the same as an optician, but for the ears and hearing instead of the eyes. We want our patients to think about their ear checks the same as their eyes – once a year. And it’s free at Duncan and Todd, so there’s no cost to make sure your hearing is at its best.”Visit the Duncan and Todd website to find out more about their hearing care services."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen groups urged to apply for 2500 funding","story":"Aberdeen community groups have been urged to apply for up to £, of funding.The deadline for applications to Aberdeen City Health Improvement Fund will close next month on November .Delivered in partnership with NHS Grampian, Aberdeen City Council and the Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership, the fund is available to initiatives that improve health and wellbeing in Aberdeen.Open to anyone living or working in Aberdeen, the money is available to iniduals, staff or community groups , voluntary or non-profit organisations.Successful applications from last year included a sheltered housing complex in Parkhill Court and a miscarriage support service set up by Abi Clark from Blackburn in .

The town’s existing cemetery on Castle Road is at capacity.Two community councils had written to the local authority objecting to the development.George Stewart on behalf of the Ellon Community Council submitted a public comment, stating: “The development represents a departure from the Local Development Planand as such has not been given the appropriate scrutiny and public consultation.“There does not appear to be a sustainable foot cycle path to the site from Golf Road at its junction with Hospital Road.“This could be solved by a shared use path west linking to the Buchan and Formartine Way.“The entrance to the site is not on a local bus route preventing some visitors from accessing the site. The car park may not be large enough and may result in cars being parked along theof the A, causing traffic congestion and a hazard to other road users.”Ythan Community Council had also voiced an objection.Charles Coulson from the group said: “Ythan Community Council objects to the proposal to build a cemetery at the proposed site.“In recent discussion of the next LDP the extension of the boundary northwards was considered to be undesirable given that the next major proposed development of Ellon is to be in the Cromleybank area. The question of vehicular access is also of concern.“The Ellon Northern relief road was built to provide a viable alternative to driving through the centre of Ellon.“To provide a safe system of traffic management to access this proposed site will require traffic calming measures which will negate the relief road.“The image of a host of cars following a slow moving cortege from the town centre trying to access the junction at Golf Road on a bend and then turning into the proposed cemetery is too alarming to allow.”Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said: “The planning application has been withdrawn as it requires amendment following discussions with planners, it is our intention to resubmit the planning application in the very near future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"drivers urged to take alternative route as section of busy aberdeen road down to one lane","story":"Drivers are being urged to find an alternative route tonight after an oil spill on an Aberdeen road.A section of the southbound lane on Wellington Road has been closed due to the leak from a broken down crane.

looking after Michelle’s grandmother at another centre.She said: “It was one of those really random meetings.“I saw a lady sitting there and I thought: ‘I know your face’.“We got chatting and she was telling me about her daughter, and said that she now owns alpacas and they were looking for them to be used more as therapy pets.“So we got in touch with Michelle, and she said that she’d love to do it.”The trio visited the centre during the summer to make sure that all would go well, but it wasn’t long before the residents were asking for them back.Fiona said: “We had one tenant who couldn’t

because they are dferent.“Yes, there might be dferent dogs that come in, but it’s a highlight for them to see and touch something more unusual.”Michelle said: “Fiona got chatting to my parents, and

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op. And the busy dad-of-three apparently had no idea that the arrival of the President of the United States was imminent. By the time he’d come out of the shop with his shopping, police were taking no chances and had removed his car from Maybole High Street. And Peter Goudie, , came face to face with officers, including armed police, who were twitchy that his Volkswagen Golf was in the way.  Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community. We actively engaged with local providers and Prentice coaches are implementing changes to the  service, which will start on October  from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via the Tesco turning area and will now mirror the times of the T T to allow connection from other services.ldquoOperators looked at the T  service the general conclusion was that a straight like-for-like service was not commercially viable due to the numbers using the service.ldquoThe council is not licensed to operate the running of service work and our own fleet is at full capacity however, we will continue to discuss options, which will include community buses as a way to support residents who are affected.Ross Prentice, managing director of Prentice Coaches Ltd, said: ldquoWe are starting a new bus service, the , on Monday. It will run from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird via Port Seton and Prestonpans.ldquoOnce it gets to The Loan in Wallyford it will replace the Tesco T bus by going down Macbeth Moir Road and Pinkie Road, then into Tesco before continuing to Fort Kinnaird.We will evaluate passenger use after a few weeks and hope to be able to expand the route in the new year.ldquoWe also currently run two routes into Tesco, the  and , and, from October , the  will make that three routes which will give a pretty good coverage of the Musselburgh area to and from the store.Iain Clark, chairman of Musselburgh Area Partnership, said: ldquoThe area partnership has recently been presented with the findings of our lsquowhat matters to yoursquo questionnaire, which highlights a number of areas that would make a dference to the daily live of the senior members of our community.

Critics claim darker mornings are dangerous for children walking to school.In , a YouGov poll found  per cent of Brits supported keeping clocks forward permanently, while  per cent were against.Most parts of North America and Europe, plus some areas in the Middle East observe DST.

Mrs Barbourrsquos army went toe-to-toe with bailfrsquos officers trying to evict their neighbours and finally marched on the sherf court to support tenants being prosecuted for non-payment of the rent increases.David Lloyd George was forced to intervene as Munitions Minister and the Rent Restrictions Act was passed within a month, a piece of legislation that inspired similar movements across the world. If some of the unelected executives in Glasgow City currently pulling down six-figure salaries had had their way Mary Barbour and her women would probably still be fighting this battle.On Tuesday and Wednesday , women staged a strike and marched for the equal wages and the payment of a decade of back money to which their entitlement is now enshrined in law. A few streets away stuntmen in black sports cars and motorcycles were filming the latest in the Fast and Furious movie franchise, Hobbs and Shaw. In Glasgowrsquos city chambers the response by officials both elected and unelected could be described as aw and naw.The leader of Glasgow City Council, Susan Aitken, tried to pat the women on the head while suggesting that they didnrsquot really know why they were striking. To be fair to Ms Aitken, she inherited this situation following a decade when the ruling Labour administration spent pound.m fighting the claims of more than , mainly female public sector workers to have pay parity with their male colleagues. Such wretched conduct was characteristic of Labour in Scotland as it gradually lost the hearts and minds of its core support. Ms Aitken made the task of ending this dispute a primary manesto commitment in  and few doubt her desire or sincerity. Yet, at times during this dispute it seems that she, an elected official, is being undermined by those who have been wielding real power in Glasgowrsquos city chambers for far too long.Certainly, there can be no doubt that the issues genesis and its consequences lie at the door of successive Labour administrations and this rendered the messages of support from Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard hollow. A wiser course for Mr Leonard and the Pavlov Dogs in his party to have adopted would have been simply to have acknowledged Labourrsquos faults and pledged to support all sides in reaching a just settlement.Yet, the SNP must also watch its step. It has spent  years at the task of taking Glasgow from Labour and has been able to occupy most of the moral high ground in this dispute. Some of the partyrsquos rhetoric and tactics in the course of these febrile last few weeks, though, has been questionable. Whoever spun the line that the proposed two-day strike would put the health and lives of vulnerable people at risk obviously knows little about the issues at the heart of the dispute. Council executives were also given three weeksrsquo notice to make alternative arrangements.These are troubles those who inhabit George Squarersquos executive suite will never encounter. Their remuneration packages along with all others at the council who earn more than poundk rose from  earning collectively pound,, in   to  who got pound,, in  , according to the Investigative Journalism Unit, The Ferret.Ms OrsquoDonnell herself earned pound, in  , an increase of more than poundk in one year. When this dispute has been settled, Ms Aitkenrsquos next task must be to hold these unelected executives to account. Their high-handed and arrogant attitude has probably cost the city tens of millions and led to increased hardship for thousands of claimants and their families. The elected leader of Glasgow City Council needs to show these people that she is the real boss.She could start by asking why her chief executive missed  previous meetings to negotiate with trade unions before finally getting involved by threatening to deploy Thatcherite anti-trade union laws. The threatening letter about secondary strike action sent to the unions sent by Carole Forrest, the councilrsquos director of governance on Tuesday night was a serious error of judgment. It risked escalating the dispute at a time when both sides were already beginning to release some air from the situation. It also betrayed ignorance of how trade unionism has shaped this cityrsquos industrial history. Few Glasgow citizens have been left untouched by the kindness and hard work of these women over many decades. Many of us will eventually come to rely on their gentleness when it is our time for the soup and tartan blankets. We also have a near-sacred tradition of not crossing picket lines in a just dispute.Scotlandrsquos First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, tweeted her support of the Glasgow women but said the withdrawal of their labour was unnecessary. She was wrong, for this was a most necessary strike and a reminder that such actions still have a place in an industrial landscape that remains grossly unequal."},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-at-centre-of-perfect-storm-over-pay-for-teachers-and-lecturers","story":"Being derailed by the perfect storm of industrial action over pay in both school and college sectors is the last thing the Education Secretary needs.Teachers are demanding a  per cent pay rise across the board after a decade of austerity, while college lecturers want cost of living increases on top of an existing harmonisation deal which pushed the top of the pay scale to more than pound,.Mr Swinney, alongside council employers and college management, believe the offers on the table for both sectors are the most affordable possible and also deliver on a number of other priorities.The minister said an extra pound million for teachers on top of the three per cent pay rise for all staff, and annual progression, would see all teachers on the main grade scale receiving at least a five per cent increase - with some getting up to  per cent to help recruitment and retention.By seeking to contact teachers directly to inform them of the detail of the deal Mr Swinney clearly believes classroom staff will see the offer as beneficial, regardless of what their unions are telling them.A similar lack of movement in college negotiations is likely to be motivated by concern that, having delivered higher salaries for most lecturers through harmonisation, unions are still coming back for more.If industrial action ballots come back strongly in favour of strikes then that might sht thinking.The gamble for unions, even with a united membership, is whether the wider public, equally affected by austerity, will have sympathy for protracted strikes over pay demands which exceed their own limited expectations.The crucial factor might be that, while both strikes are

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amSee this week#s edition of The Orcadian for over thirty job listings.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority.

This is not some dry, academic debate.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Saturday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The starter is clear soup. Well it’s actually water ... but not just any old water – it’s been boiled and puried. That’s followed by turkey, served pretty much incinerated after eight hours at  degrees. There is no pudding again this year after the notorious incident with the sixpence and don’t even think about asking for cheese.If that approach to food seems joyless and uncompromising, spare a thought for cheesemaker Tricia Bey. This week she announced her Barwheys Dairy is to close and the finger of blame is being very firmly pointed at an overzealous Food Standards Scotland, based in Aberdeen.Ten years after starting production in an attempt to revive traditional cheesemaking in Ayrshire, Tricia has simply had enough. She took to social media to announce she has stopped production and will close her dairy this year, blaming rising costs and over-regulation of the industry.: Stephen Jardine: I just had one of my worst meals out everShe said: “Increasingly invasive and onerous inspection and testing regimes have taken all the joy out of our previously happy enterprise.”She believes responsibility for this lies with Food Standards Scotland which has also been in a long-running wrangle with another producer, Errington Cheese. The organisation denies having a vendetta against artisan producers but there is growing concern about the way it goes about its business.Stringent food hygiene standards are not something to be taken lightly. Earlier this month two children died in an E-coli outbreak in Leicestershire and public health officials are still trying to identy the cause. Whatever can be sensibly done to limit the risk of food leading to sickness and illness should be done but what is sensible when it comes to limiting risk  So many things can go wrong. A chef might not wash their hands properly, a kne might not have been adequately cleaned, a bug may still be on a lettuce leaf and soil residue on the skin of a potato. To eliminate all potential causes of problems is practically impossible but it seems that is what Food Standards Scotland is on a mission to do.: Stephen Jardine: Is the Michelin guide biased against Scottish food Faced with some of the big issues affecting salmon farms or the repeated instances of mislabelling in the meat industry, small artisan producers with limited resources are an easy target in comparison. What is proportionate has been lost in the clamour to send out some kind of message.There is another way. I lived in Paris for two years where most cheese shops would struggle to satisfy food hygiene regulators here. However artisan production flourished because regulation there was built on common sense and a proportionate approach to risk by inspectors and consumers. Here a heavy-handed approach based on regulation rather than cooperation is sending a shiver through small-scale food production. Food Standards Scotland will say they are simply making our country a safer place for us to live and eat. Butthe way they are doing it is literally scaring people like Tricia Bey out of business, then something is going very wrong in the way the organisation conducts its affairs.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820806.1540648488!/image/image.jpg","title":"30 000 take part in teachers march in glasgow to demand better pay","story":"Some , marchers have taken to the streets of Glasgow to support teachers campaigning for a % pay rise, organisers have said.Scotland’s largest teaching union, the EIS, organised the event, with general secretary Larry Flanagan hailing the turnout at the demo as “absolutely magnicent”.Teachers, parents and their children and other campaigners marched from Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Park to George Square, where union leaders and politicians addressed crowds.So large was the rally that reports suggested when the first marchers arrived there, others were still waiting to set off.The EIS has been calling for teachers to be given a % rise to restore the value of salaries following public sector pay caps.A pay offer which would have seen all teachers get a rise of % was rejected last month and was described as “isive”, with issues raised over the parity of pay.Education secretary John Swinney argued the deal would result in all teachers on the main grade scale receiving at least a % increase, with some teachers receiving up to % in one year in conjunction with annual progression.Speaking at the rally in George Square, Mr Flanagan said: “It is absolutely magnicent to look out on this massive demonstration and know that we are here, united, because we believe that the future of Scottish education is worth standing up and fighting for.“Our pay claim is for % - given that the value of take-home pay has dropped by % in the last decade, that claim is already a compromise on what we deserve. And here is the simple fact -you want to have qualied teachers in front of pupils in our schools, you need to address the recruitment and retention crisis we are facing.”EIS president Alison Thornton added: “The salaries of teachers in schools in Scotland are below the European average and those of other countries in the wider world.“Our pupil contact hours are high, and we still work an average of  hours of unpaid overtime each week to deal with the demands of the job.“Austerity doesn’t work, quality public services need proper funding and by investing in teachers then there is investment in education and our young people and their futures.”Local government body Cosla said it took a joint decision with the Scottish Government to write to teachers “spelling out the value and merits of the pay offer currently on the table”.The EIS will open a ballot of its members on Tuesday calling on them to reject the current offer. The ballot closes on November .Mr Swinney said: “I hugely value the work teachers do and the vital contribution they make to improve outcomes for children.“We want teaching to be a rewarding career choice - to keep people in the profession and to attract new entrants - and that is why the Scottish Government is contributing an additional £ million this year for teachers’ pay.“Through a combination of a % increase for all staff earning up to £,, restructuring the main grade scale and annual progression, the majority of teachers receive a rise between % and %. There would be a flat rate increase of £, for those earning more than £, from  April .”The Education Secretary added that reference to conditions of service forming part of the negotiations “is factually incorrect”.He said: “Our offer to teachers is for one year, and compares favourably with the pay award for the majority of health workers of % over three years and the recently announced award .% increase for police officers covering  months.“I firmly believe this is a generous and fair offer which demonstrates the value both the Scottish Government and local government place on the teaching profession.“We remain committed to continuing discussions with teaching unions in good faith.”But Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who addressed the rally, said it showed “Scotland’s teachers won’t be bullied into accepting another real terms pay cut by the SNP”.He said: “It’s time for Mr Swinney to put a fair pay deal on the table to provide teachers with the respect and due recognition they deserve.”Meanwhile Scottish Green education spokesman Ross Greer hailed the demonstration as being the “largest single-union march in modern history”.He added: “Scotland’s teachers have shown that they are ready to fight to win back some of the % their pay value has lost over the last decade.“John Swinney should stop the threats to undermine unions, ditch his deeply unwanted governance reforms and address the real issues in our schools, namely a much-reduced, demoralised and overwhelmed teaching and support workforce trying to deliver the impossible with not nearly enough resources.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4820711.1540588712!/image/image.jpg","title":"new drive to win backing for assisted dying law in scotland","story":"Assisted dying campaigners claim there is now #empathy and understanding# among MSPs about the need to introduce the controversial measure in Scotland.Supporters are preparing to step up activities in the coming months, with a keynote screening of the groundbreakingdocumentary How to Die in Oregon being staged in Edinburgh next week to help raise awareness.But opponents warned that there is no groundswell of support for such a move and say a lack of safeguards in the US state has prompted concerns that vulnerable people are being pressurised to end their lives prematurely.The Scottish Parliament has twice rejected plans to introduce assisted dying in Scotland over the past decade, but campaigners insist flaws in the previous legislation were the problem and the measure has overwhelming public support.A cross-party group at Holyrood has been established to look at the prospect of a fresh attempt to introduceassisted dying. Legislation appears unlikely in the current parliament, but campaigners are poised to launch a renewed drive in the new yearto win over the public and politicians.Heather McQueen founded Dignity in Dying Edinburgh group after watching her mother suffer a “cruel and “inhumane” death two years ago. She is behind the documentary screening being held by the group at St Augustine’s on Monday evening as part of an awareness-raisingpush to dispel the myths. Ms McQueen says lack of understanding surrounding assisted dying means that people are “frightened” by the process.She added: “Having seen this film it’s touching, it’sharrowing, but it’s actually quite re-assuring. I know this sounds strange but there are some really nice deaths there.“And having seen a not nice death, I think it would be good for people to realise that that’s what this can allow.”The award-winning documentary takes a fly-on-the wall style approach to severalcases in the US state where assisted dying has been legal for the past  years. It has won a number of awards and featured at the Sundance Film Festival.The late Margo MacDonald spearheaded two attempts to introduce assisted suicide legislation. it was defeated by  votes to  at Holyrood in . Five years, later, following Mrs MacDonald’s death from Parkinson’s disease in , it was again rejected. But this time support increased to  MSPs backing it, albeit opposition remained stable at .Ms McQueen’s described the previous attempts at passing legislation in Scotland as “half-cocked”. “There were ious problems with the way it has been discussed before,” she said.“One of the main problems I think is that it went forward as an Assisted Suicide Bill. But this is quite definitely not assisted suicide. “These are people who are dying. That’s what we want to change, who we want the choice for.“So in no way are we talking about introducing a bill to legalise suicide, that’s not the same thing at all.”Polling conducted by Dignity in Dying indicates that  per cent of the voting public in Scotland are in favour of assisted dying.“Had they actually considered an idea with more safeguards built in, I don not think we would have had the outcome wehad,” Ms McQueen went on.“Having spoken to some MSPs, although they’re unwilling to commit and don’twant to say anything they’re going to be quoted on, I’m actually detecting a lot of empathy and a lot of understanding thatthis does actually need to change.”But Dr Gordon Macdonald, Senior Policy Officer with CARE for Scotland said there was “no evidence” of a sht in opinion among MSPs on the issue.He said: “The public when presented with the main arguments opposed to assisted suicide show that there is no overwhelming support for that proposal. “Rather support for assisted suicide falls dramatically [to less than  per cent] when the public get the opportunity to hear the main argument against it, that it would put vulnerable people at risk. For these reasons MSPs should reject any new efforts to change the law in this area.”He pointed to “year on year increases” in the number of people committing suicide with state assistance where it is legal. “In Switzerland, the number of assisted suicides has increased by over , per cent in the same period with alarming levels of assisted suicide tourism now occurring,”he added.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island.

The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8680982.1540388113!/image/image.jpg","title":"london support sought for 20 000 jobs blueprint","story":"A delegation from an area rocked by the loss of more than , highly paid manufacturing jobs in recent years is currently in Westminster with a blueprint to revitalise its economy.Business leaders, politicians and council officials from Mid and East Antrim are telling the UK Government of their ambitious plans to deliver economic growth through the proposed £bn Belfast Region City Deal.The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim, which has suffered signicant job losses with the closures of Michelin and JTI Gallaher in Ballymena.This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, Islandmagee, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.Anne Donaghy, council chief executive, said: “As a council, we are fully committed to supporting business growth and development, and promoting an environment that encourages and facilitates investment in our borough.“We focus our efforts on being an enabler to the wealth creators.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it. We canrsquot thank them enough.She said that there were too many to name but she would like to make a special mention of local landscape architect Matthew Morrison, who helped with the sensory garden, the charities RNIB, Angel Eyes, and Murphyrsquos Bar who consistently fund-raised, and Downpatrick Lions Club who organised for a gazebo to be used in the garden for Megan.ldquoIn the early days with Megan, we really didnrsquot know what to expect for her.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But late yesterday it seemed certain to pass without a deal on the UKrsquos withdrawal.Speaking after being briefed by the EUrsquos chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr. Tusksaid he saw ldquono grounds for optimism ahead of the European Council summit.ldquoAs I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr. Tusk told a Brussels press conference.ldquoHowever, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Mr. Tusk said he would ask Mrs. May whether she had concrete proposals on how to break the impasse saying that only such proposals can determinea breakthrough is possible.Reports from Brussels suggested senior European Commission officials were casting doubt on the prospect of a special Brexit summit being declared for Novemberthere is no movement on the key issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Mrs. May won strong support from Cabinet colleagues on Tuesday as she set out two key ldquosticking points preventing the conclusion of a withdrawal agreement.The issues relate to the ldquobackstop agreement demanded by the EU to avoid a hard Border by keeping Northern Ireland within the European customs area.Mrs. May has countered by offering to keep the whole UK in a customs union, but only for a temporary period.She issued a plea for unity as she said she remained determined to secure a Brexit that would respect the result of the  referendum, protect jobs and security and preserve the Union.ldquoIrsquom convinced thatwe as a Government stand together and stand firm, we can achieve this, she said.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones. For a brief time, we suggest there is a unique in-between identity for those situated between two countries ndash a Border people ndash and through playful acts we explore this liminal identity.lsquoAcross and In-Betweenrsquo was co-commissioned by - NOW, the UKrsquos arts programme for the First World War centenary, and Belfast International Arts Festival, with the support of the Government of Irelandrsquos Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .Across and In Between was co-created with Cian Smyth, Helen Sharp, Mark Thomas of Soup Co, Pedro Rebelo, Conan McIvor, Helen Sloan, Eva Grosman, Garrett Carr and people in Pettigo, Tullyhommon, Castlesaunderson, Magheraveely, Newtownbutler, Cuilcagh Mountain, Counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They would probably demand more, particularlythe Tory-DUP agreement fell.None of what he said was surprising. Indeed, it was obvious.It is worth reflecting on how the republican movement, unlike anyone  in the political process, feels it can make such demands.This week the Renewable Heat Incentiveinquiry hearings came to an end.This newspaper, despite being one of the UK’s smaller regional daily newspapers, has been the place to read about RHI. Day after day, Sam McBride has filed thousands of words on the hearings. It was clear from the beginning that inquiry would be uncomfortable for the DUP. Some people remarked upon the fact that the News Letter, a strongly unionist newspaper, has covered the scandal so closely but few people now question the signicance of the story.On Wednesday, the only member of Sinn Fein to appear before the inquiry, Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, did so. For three and a half hours the former finance minister gave testimony as to Sinn Fein’s approach to governance and RHI. I was sitting in the press gallery, as I was when other key witnesses such as Jonathan Bell and Arlene Foster testied.Mr Ó Muilleoir’s evidence sounded so relentlessly sanctimonious that I wonderedactually he was rather rattled by having to appear as a witness, orhegenuinely was as sure of his own and his party’s moral goodness as he sounded.After outlining the punctilious, by-the-book way Sinn Fein appoints its Spads, and after even at points spelling out how this rectitudecontrasted with the DUP omissions, he without apparent embarrassment explained how they kept on a Sinn Fein advisor, who could no longer serve as a Spad . This advisor stayed on at Stormont so that he in fact sat above the Spads.The said law had been sponsored on by Jim Allister MLA, inspired by Ann Travers, after Mary McArdle who was convicted in connection with the murder of Ann’s sister Mary, was appointed a Spad.Mr Ó Muilleoir described the Spad law that his party tried to circumvent via a ‘Super Spad’ was an “attack on the peace process”.Road schemes finally get go-ahead yet keep hitting legal problems Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He breezily dismissed the repeated evidence that Sinn Fein battled in early  to keep the RHI scheme kept open. During his testimony an email, which like others was shown on a screen to the chamber, was from Michelle O’Neill referring to people being “left high and dry”. Sinn Fein did all this out of concern for scheme users, he said.SF brought down Stormont because, perhaps above all their other grievances, of RHI. Schools and hospitals remain rudderless. The party has preached about RHI ever since, and yet it was lobbying hard for it to be kept open.On Wednesday, Mr Ó Muilleoir, even when self critical, was so with apparent self regard. “I make no apologies,” he said at point, “I make no excuses for myself.”He brushed off the role of Ted Howell, the senior republican, whose name appears in e-mails in late . Mr Howell’s emergence was the fault of the DUP, because he had been brought in to deal with the political crisis they created.Mr Ó Muilleoir did not appear to miss a beat when questioned by the inquiry about the line where he asked Mr Howell in an email: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ” It was a request about timing, not a request for permission.Mr Ó Muilleoir also explained that his baffling initial hesitancy to call a public inquiry was, in part, because the family of the murdered solicitor Pat Finucane opposed the  Inquiries Act. This was one of a couple of points on Wednesday when Sir Patrick Coghlingot irritable with Mr Ó Muilleoir’s evidence.But the latter only endured an afternoon of scrutiny.One thing that has emerged from the RHI inquiry is that devolved government needs greater scrutiny.There has been little scrutiny of the suggestion in the  paramilitary report that the IRA army council exerts influence on Sinn Fein.There was no scrutiny of the IRA spying at Stormont or break-in at Castlereagh that led to direct rule in  . All politicians were punished, not just republican ones.There was no proper scrutiny of the later Northern Bank heist, the murders of Robert McCartney, of Paul Quinn or Kevin McGuigan.London could have examined all those controversies and others, such as the Colombia IRA-FARC episode in -, given the global climate towards terrorism after .It never did.The DUP could have toppled Stormont with good cause after the  report but never did, or after the On The Runs secret scheme.Many people in Northern Ireland, mostly unionist but also people across the spectrum who would eschew that term, are getting increasingly angry at the sense that Sinn Fein get special dispensation.The law was changed to give it allowances at Westminster while it continued to boycott it.Martin McGuinness told Saville’s Bloody Sunday inquiry he was constrained in what he could say by “a republican code of honour”.Latterly the political wing of the IRA, which killed far more people than any other group, has made demands on legacy before Stormont can , seemingly unafraid of the proposed legacy structures.In this paper last week the ex assistant chief constable and Assets Recovery Agency head Alan McQuillan warned of pressure “not least from the two governments” not to pursue those whose arrest might “destabilise the peace process”.Remember that as elderly soldiers face trial for single shootings in the Troubles, no leaders of the IRA who orchestrated decades of violence faced charges akin to directing terrorism.Does it ever occur to London that allegations of illegal or undemocratic behaviour might be as deserving of public scrutiny as RHI You might expect a Tory government propped up unionists, an Alliance Party that holds the balance of power, a Fine Gael government, and indeed that wing of the SDLP that hated the IRA, to agree on this. But there is no such consensus. There is no demand from any of the above for reform of republican practice before Stormont s.Instead, Sinn Fein will “raise the bar” before Stormont can .If the past is anything to go by, everyone will probably jump to it.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8684454.1540645310!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Legacy scandal: lsquoThe principle thou shalt not upset the terrorists dictates our approach to the past,rsquo says Austin StackIn the latest essay in our series, AUSTIN STACK says the IRA shot his prison officer father because he thwarted their efforts to escape: Opinion,     .RHI Inquiry: Arlene Fosterrsquos sworn evidence about me canrsquot be right, says Andrew McCormickAn account of what happened on the night of Stephen Nolan#s seminal interview with Arlene Foster where she responded to Jonathan Bell#s allegations simply cannot be accurate, a senior civil servant has told the RHI Inquiry.News,  ..DUP Spad told me ldquowe could fill our boots with RHI cash, says top civil servantArlene Foster#s long-standing special adviser who is accused of having deliberately delayed cost controls on the RHI scheme later told a top civil servant he thought #we could fill our boots# with money, the RHI Inquiry has heard.

Andrew McCormick had been permanent secretary in Mrs Fosters Stormont department The inquiry has heard several pieces of evidence which show that Mrs Foster’s closest advisers – who spent hours preparing her for the huge interview – had been aware of the allegation that it was Mrs Foster’s special adviserAndrew Crawford who had worked in the shadows to delay cost controls.Although he has always denied that, senior civil servant Andrew McCormick – who had been in the department running the scheme at the point where the delay happened – had told Mrs Foster’s key advisers Timothy Johnston and Richard Bullick that it was his belief that Dr Crawford was behind the delay.However, Mrs Foster’s version of events – which like Dr McCormick’s evidence was given under oath – was that Dr McCormick had never said that directly to her until after the interview.Last month she told the inquiry: “Well, I became aware of his belief after the recording of ‘The Nolan Show’. As I said, ‘The Nolan Show’ was recorded in my office, my First Minister office.“Opposite my First Minister’s office is the junior minister’s office, and, once the recording was over, I went into the junior minister’s office. I think Richard and Timothy stayed behind to speak to Mr Nolan and try and correct some of the misapprehensions he had around the scheme...and then Andrew, as I recall, and, I think, Simon Hamilton, although I don’t have it in my statement, but I think Simon was around as well — and Andrew sheepishly said it was his belief that Andrew Crawford had delayed the scheme. “So it was after the recording, as it were, of The Nolan Show that I had that direct intervention from Andrew McCormick.”Mrs Foster appeared to have a clear memory of some conversation with Dr McCormick about the issue, recalling that he had been “sheepish”.She went on to say: “Whether it was that evening, which I believe it was, or whether it was the next day, it certainly was after ‘The Nolan Show’ that I spoke directly to Andrew about the issue.”DUP minister Simon Hamilton, who was also there that night, gave similar evidence to the inquiry about a conversation with Dr McCormick “definitely after the interview”.However, Dr McCormick said thatthat conversation did occur it could not have been after the recording – and therefore would have to have been before Mrs Foster told the public she had “no idea” why cost controls were delayed.Dr McCormick said that the DUP had kept him at Stormont Castle so that he – as someone outside the party whose integrity was respected – could assert to Mr Nolan that a ‘fact sheet’ prepared for the broadcaster was accurate.

That, Dr McCormick told the inquiry, had left him “very frustrated that having been kept waiting in the expectation of a substantive engagement with Stephen Nolan, [it] didn’t happen and I went straight home – so there is no possibility that I had a meeting with Arlene Foster or Simon Hamilton that evening between the recording, which happened between eight and nine, and the broadcast of the Nolan interviews later that evening.“That could not possibly have happened. And indeed the next day, the minutes of the NICS board record me as being at the NICS board from first thing on Friday morning. I had the conversation with Tim Cairns [as well as] with Chris Stewart in Netherleigh around lunch time that day. I had the long phone call with Máirtín Ó Muilleoir and his colleagues later that day.“I don’t see any possibility – and I would remember going to Stormont Castle to meet the First Minister – I didn’t do that on the Friday, and I was at home all weekend, so that, I’m afraid, is not possible – it’s not possible for what Arlene Foster and Simon Hamilton have described to have happened.”Later,when Mrs Foster’s interview being broadcast, Dr McCormick texted DUP Spads in incredulity at her “no idea” answer. He wrote: “Dficult to understand why she said she had no idea...when I have said I would have to tell [a Stormont committee] that”.Mrs Foster went on to give a statement tot he Assembly several days later which also left Dr McCormick concerned as to her level of candour.Yesterday Dr McCormick told the inquiry: “I’m very concerned by what I’ve had to say this morning.” He said his concern related both to what Mrs Foster told the BBC and to what she told the Assembly.He also told the inquiry that he had a clear memory from the night when the Nolan interview was recorded in Stormont Castle of someone saying “we don’t want to name Andrew Crawford because he’s done nothing wrong” but he could not recall who had said it.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Are you listening  @JohnSwinney @COSLA #ValueEducationValueTeachers #EISOct #PayAttention pic rvXemdash EISOctober , Speaking at the rally in George Square, EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ldquoIt is absolutely magnicent to look out on this massive demonstration and know that we are here, united, because we believe that the future of Scottish education is worth standing up and fighting for.ldquoOur pay claim is for % ndash given that the value of take-home pay has dropped by % in the last decade, that claim is already a compromise on what we deserve.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
