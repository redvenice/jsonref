Isaac Newton put stock by them. In 2018, where the vibe is authenticity and self-determinism, we still have horoscopes in respectable magazines, on your favourite websites, and we read them: a study conducted by American Federation of Astrologers found that as many as 70 million people read their horoscope every day.In an effort to understand our obsession with the ‘scope, I decided to conduct an experiment: I would follow my Gemini horoscope to the letter every day for a month.Astrologer Francesca Oddie recommended I follow the monthly overview on Astrostyle, but advised caution.‘Monthly horoscopes have their place our Sun Sign, or Star Sign, is arguably the most important planet in the chart and that’s why horoscopes continue to be written and devoured on a daily basis.However, all the planets in the sky should be considered when reading a horoscope, or birth chart as it is otherwise known. Horoscopes can undermine astrology, diluting its power and only tell us part of a really interesting story.’With Francesca’s words ringing in my ears, I printed out my March prediction and ploughed on.Maybe I would prove her wrong?March 1 delivers the first full moon, which activates your sensitive fourth house of home, family and feelings. This could unleash a deeply personal response to something you’ve gone through in the past six months—and a long overdue one at that.I wrack my brains about what this ‘something’ could be I’ve had a lot happen in the last six months, including a cervical cancer scare and a month-long trip to Asia. It seems ridiculously vague – not a great start.Then I read this:If you’ve been pondering a move or a change to your living situation, the full moon will catalyze that.I’m spooked. I’ve been planning a total overhaul of my flat for months I have spreadsheets that attest to it.And just like that, I’m sucked in.Time to have “the talk” today? Stress has accelerated in an important relationship, and you can’t keep tiptoeing around the problem.Eerie. I need to talk to my boyfriend about something – something impacted by stress – and have been stewing on it for ages.I go to text him, then decide that it’s better we talk in person, then decide I don’t want to and I won’t be dictated to by a horoscope.I wonder: do people follow their horoscope despite their own gut instinct?My brother announces that he is buying a flat with a girlfriend, prompting my boyfriend and I to frantically Google places we can (and can’t) afford.I go back to Day 1’s prediction…could this be the full moon at work?Since the sixth house rules the digestive system (and Jupiter’s the god of the feast), read up on gut health…Researching your family’s health history can help you make smarter dietary and lifestyle choices in the name of prevention. I’ve always had dodgy digestion but it’s got worse in recent years. I put it down to age…could it be genetic?In deference to my horoscope, I text a relative who has IBS.He suggests that I go gluten and dairy free, so I instantly cut out milky lattes and my tummy trouble practically goes away.I think. It could be all in my head.The March 13 Sun-Jupiter trine gives you a galvanizing boost of motivation. Book a session with a coach or trainer, or start any self-improvement program now.I am now well and truly into my ‘scope so I book a 30 minutes with life coach Carole Ann Rice.We discuss my anxiety about work and tendency to lose confidence Carol Ann listens, says nice things and explains that regret is in the past and anxiety is in the future, which really resonates.I finish our call feeling positive, productive and calm – and it’s all down to following my horoscope.Who cares if they’re fake!A business or leadership opportunity could arrive on March 17. I put this in my calendar, sit back and wait.March 17 comes and goes without a sniff of a business or leadership role.That said… I had a call yesterday with someone who wants me to write for his new venture.Does it matter that it’s a day out?The Sun is in Pisces and your goal-oriented tenth house of structure and career until March 20, which could turn up the heat on your professional endeavors.About time – I think incessantly about my career. Although find me a freelance journalist who doesn’t.We’re over half way through the month and my ‘professional endeavours’ feel tepid at best.I guess they won’t all be winners. Cynicism 1, horoscope 0.From March 22 to April 15, your ruling planet, Mercury, will be retrograde in Aries, which could disrupt communication, technology and travel plans. If you’re planning a big launch, you might want to use this cycle for testing and tweaking, then unleash your viral creations in the second half of April.It’s 2018: even my friend’s hamster has an Instagram page. This ‘viral creation’ could be anything from a well-composed Whatsapp to a full-on campaign.But it is a bit weird. I was planning a new digital project and was all set to launch it.It put it on hold until mid-April. I can’t help myself.The month closes on a passionate note…An artistic venture or love connection that’s been brewing over the past six months could turn into a real-deal moment. Spring fever definitely kicks in now. Dress up, flirt and let your vibrant personality shine.As soon as I read this, I know that I’m done with horoscopes.This prescription is laughably generic. The ‘artistic venture’ could be literally anything because I do a creative job. Typical Gemini.The love connection could apply to my boyfriend or my dad or my dentist, and ‘Spring fever’? Not much of a surprise at the end of March.Horoscopes are not backed up by science even Francesca told me to be careful, but now my month following the ‘scope is over, I sort of…miss it.I become scarily reliant on the daily dose of good news – and it is overwhelmingly good news.It was a huge relief to know that my career and love ‘connections’ would improve – because relationships and work are the two things we all worry about the most.Horoscopes work by giving a lifeline to people that want reassurance. So that’s all of us, then.‘We are all complex, intricate and multilayered splitting each of us up into twelve segments is not wise,’ says Francesca.Reading your horoscope won’t do you any harm, but it’s not what I’ll be turning to when I want to feel whole.MORE: I spent a week saying no to try and be more assertive, and here’s the resultMORE: I went to a meditation disco and it was better than therapyMORE: I went to an early morning rave at Daybreaker in West London and it was better than a night out"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/image-26.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"lily allen plans reveal boozy mile high sesh liam gallagher tell memoir","story":"Lily Allen and Liam Gallagher reportedly had a nice time aboard a flight (picture: Getty)Well this is going to be one juicy tell-all, if the reports are true!Word on the street is that Lily Allen has penned a tell-all memoir – My Thoughts Exactly – and one story on the list is in regards to a mile-high ‘romp’ with one Liam Gallagher.The Not Fair singer, 32, has been reported to be in the process of writing up all the sordid details of an alleged sesh aboard an 11-hour flight to Japan with Oasis rocker Liam, 45.Lily is in the process of releasing a memoir (Credit: BBC)The two were on their way to the Fuji Rocks festival in 2009, according to The Sun, and toasted with champagne at Heathrow’s Upper Class lounge according to what she’d reportedly wrote up in her book about the mid-flight ‘fling’.An insider told the publication about the memoir, set for release this year: ‘Lily’s agent has been touting the first draft of the book and boasting that nothing has been held back.Metro.co.uk contacted reps of Lily and Liam for comment.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Lily Allen claims she was ‘sexually harassed’ as she hints at taking legal action agains ‘a***hole tormentor’MORE: Lily Allen dedicates F**k You to Theresa May"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7491779.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"ryanair boss michael oleary buys plane passengers a drink after grand national win","story":"Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary celebrated his Grand National win by treating delayed plane passengers to a ‘free bar’ – of one drink per person.Flight FR447 from Liverpool to Dublin was delayed for half-an-hour after his horse, Tiger Roll, won The Randox Health Grand National Handicap Steeple Chase in a photo finish at Aintree.He then announced that the patient passengers would be compensated with him breaking a long-standing Ryanair rule of giving away free alcohol.The Ryanair chief executive said: ‘Today we won the Grand National so, unusually on board this flight, there’s going to be a free bar, which I am personally going to pay for, but you’re all restricted to one free drink only.O’Leary was clearly happy about his big win (Picture: Rex Features)‘So free bar, and we may need to do a circuit over Dublin to get it all done.‘Thank you and apologies once again.’Ryanair’s average price per alcoholic drink is £5.

There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

The odds of an historic first win for a female jockey in the £1million Randox Health Grand National have been cut to 8-1.Rain that fell on the Aintree track on Friday turning part of the course heavy prompted three of the runners to pull out.But conditions will also particularly favour two of the three runners ridden by female jockeys - Baie Des Iles, the mount of by Katie Walsh, and Milansbar, who will be ridden by Bryony Frost. Rachael Blackmore, who rides Alpha Des Obeaux, is the other female jockey in the race.

A blog on the site points out the differences between ‘sugar and prostitution’, claiming that sugar daddies and babies have an ongoing relationship, and not just a financial transaction.It also claims that women on the site are not sexually abused as in prostitution and that sex is an aspiration, not a requirement. Yet evidence from women who spoke to the MoS tells a very different story. They claim that they were treated like prostitutes after signing up.A young single mother joined SA while she was a student at a Scottish university. She wanted extra money to cover her university costs while also supporting her four-year-old daughter. What turned out to be her only dates arranged through the website were with a 56-year-old man.At their first meeting, he paid for dinner and took her to the upmarket women’s clothing shop he owned, allowing her to take home any of the expensive dresses that caught her eye. But on the second date, the mood changed after he made clear to her that on the third date he expected sex. When she declined, he became enraged and began to reel off the explicit sexual services other women he had dated through Seeking Arrangement had provided him.She said: ‘I remember a particular phrase he used. He said, “This Asian girl bent over.” I remember feeling so shocked with the realisation that he expected sex. I thought, “Oh my God, this is completely screwed up.” So I just dropped him, deleted my profile from the site and got out.#IBelieveHer protesters claim victory as Irish and Ulster...Share this article‘I was naive and I did think it was a free lunch. I thought maybe you had to be seen with these men or they wanted a date for an event, a high-class escort type thing. I had no idea it was prostitution.’ The rise of university tuition fees has been beneficial for SA’s recruitment and the company aggressively markets itself to students, claiming in 2016 that more than 250,000 UK students had registered as sugar babies.Undaunted by such adverse publicity, this weekend the company is proudly hosting its latest Sugar Baby Summit in New York. In adverts for the event it says that sugar daddies, sugar babies and psychologists will all be in attendance to advise young women who attend on ‘how to bag a millionaire’.          This Cambridge PhD student said she was funding her life at university through Seeking ArrangementsShe said during the meal he plied her with copious amounts of wine, before inviting her back to his penthouse apartment where he then encouraged her to take cocaine and smoke marijuana with him.From here he cajoled her to go out on to his balcony where he forced her into a sex act with a beer bottle.On another occasion she was inundated with messages from a 70-year-old man in Brighton who offered to pay her £1,000 to have unprotected sex.The woman said she did not report the sexual assault to the police for fear of her family or friends finding out that she had sex for money.She has now left the site, but revealed the experience had left her feeling ashamed and deeply emotionally scarred. She said: ‘If a woman still thinks there is possibility of “normal dating” after signing up, she will soon understand that Seeking Arrangement and sites like it are platforms for prostitution.‘Every single interaction with men was quickly – usually after a few lines – very explicit on what they want and the price.‘All of them really quickly want nude pictures.

She set herself standards and she knew what she did and didn\u0027t want to be associated with very early on, long before Prince Harry,\u0027 explains Gina.\u0027She was always very conscious and protective of her image and rightly didn\u0027t want to do anything that would compromise that. She was already developing her role in Suits, but it was clear to me from the start that she expected to become an even bigger star.\u0027          If it is a \u0027yes\u0027 to human rights, environmentalism and gender equality – Meghan, 36, is a United Nations women\u0027s advocate – it is also a clear \u0027no\u0027 to promoting fur or animal products, and certainly a \u0027no\u0027 to anything that might make the star look, well, ordinarySay no to the SultanAn early indicator of Meghan\u0027s careful approach came on one of her first trips to the UK, where Gina and Kruger Cowne arranged for Meghan to stay at The Dorchester, the Park Lane hotel favoured by celebs and Royals.Plans were in place for Ms Markle – who insisted on using an alias even though most Britons at that point had barely heard of her – to check in for free at the five-star hotel where rooms start from £400. It was an offer for which most clients would \u0027give their eye teeth\u0027, says Gina.          Meghan Markle will join Prince Harry at two key Commonwealth events next week ahead of the Royal wedding on May 19 It came as something of a surprise to her hosts, then, when Meghan wrote to say it simply would not do. It was in conflict with her personal beliefs. The owner, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah – whose Dorchester Collection includes the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA and the Le Meurice in Paris – had recently suggested sharia punishments should be meted out to adulterers and those found to be homosexual. Women who had abortions would be flogged in public.Gina said: \u0027Meghan emailed to say she would never stay at the Dorchester, or any hotels they are involved with. We understood and of course agreed.\u0027Her stance may well have softened since meeting Prince Harry. After all, she broke her boycott last May to watch her Prince play polo at the Sultan\u0027s vast Cosworth Park estate in Ascot.And this is probably just as well as far as the Royal Family is concerned. The Sultan was a guest at the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.In December last year, Prince William welcomed the Sultan at Buckingham Palace and in November the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall made an official visit to the nation where he took tea with the Brunei Royal Family and senior government ministers.Make that picture perfectNo one understands the power of visual imagery better than Meghan, and like her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan is a keen amateur photographer, says Gina. And a painstaking one.\u0027Most photographs she put on her lifestyle blog, The Tig, were taken herself.\u0027She would see something she wanted to photograph and she would frame the shot expertly. If she was going to be in the photograph, she would hand the camera to someone and direct them, saying, \u0027Stand here and point it over there.\u0027 \u0027Let parrots fly freeIt wasn\u0027t just The Dorchester that met with a degree of disapproval. Gina remembers when Meghan checked in and out of a hotel in Knightsbridge without ever staying the night.Gina says: \u0027One time we booked her into the Jumeirah Carlton Tower and I had to meet her there to go on to a meeting.\u0027My colleague and I walked to her room and en route was this parrot sitting in a cage and Meghan looked at this parrot and looked at my colleague and said, \u0027I can\u0027t stay here because of the parrot.\u0027 She there and then checked out and went to the Soho Hotel.\u0027I realise that she\u0027s absolutely right, of course. Wild animals belong in the wild and not in cages.\u0027Tips from Harry – PotterMeghan has been determined to combine her career with humanitarian causes, particularly women\u0027s rights, and was impressed by one actress in particular – Harry Potter actress Emma Watson.\u0027On one occasion, Meghan and I attended an event where Emma, a committed feminist, was speaking,\u0027 says Gina. \u0027I could tell Meghan was quite taken with Emma\u0027s passion and commitment to her cause. I\u0027m sure she was looking at her thinking, \u0027Emma is doing this, so can I.\u0027\u0027Meghan very much wants to be a role model.\u0027Gina says that one of Meghan\u0027s greatest achievements was delivering a United Nations Women\u0027s speech in New York, where Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General at the time, stood up and thanked her and shook her hand.Meghan, whose mother Doria was in the audience, told Gina afterwards: \u0027I just could have died happy in that moment!\u0027          Miss Markle (pictured with Prince Harry at team trials for the Invictus Games in Bath) will join her fiancée at the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London on Wednesday and a Women\u0027s Empowerment reception on Thursday, hosted by the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson Don\u0027t beat about the bush\u0027She absolutely knows her own mind,\u0027 recalls Gina. \u0027At one point we were putting together a proposal for a book based on her lifestyle blog The Tig and if she didn\u0027t like part of the plan, she would tell you straight out.\u0027In the end, it wasn\u0027t published because she met Harry and obviously decided it wasn\u0027t the sort of thing she should be pursuing right now.\u0027There were people in the office she didn\u0027t gel with and she said it straight, \u0027I\u0027m not working with so and so any more.\u0027 There was no beating around the bush.\u0027It could be awkward but my job is all about building relationships so I understood where she was coming from.\u0027Dream Big – it worksWas it written in the stars? Her dream of bagging a prince was certainly written in her blog, The Tig.At about the time of Kate\u0027s wedding to Prince William in 2011, she says: \u0027Little girls dream of being princesses. And grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Royal Wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.\u0027Humorous no doubt, but prophetic also. Then, referring to a popular children\u0027s cartoon, she continues: \u0027I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power.\u0027Harry might take note."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/20/4B1FF8CB00000578-0-image-a-18_1523734952921.jpg","title":"DAN HODGES PMs won Syria lost home","story":"    Theresa May is winning the battle but losing the war over SyriaTheresa May is winning the battle but losing the war over Syria. Britain’s Armed Forces have performed with predictable courage and distinction, and according to initial damage assessments have effectively degraded the conveyor-belt of death that resulted in chemical weapons being dropped on the children, women and men of Douma.But the equally vital – and increasingly vicious – struggle to convince the British people of the need for an effective response to the gangsterism of Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin is not going her way. Indeed in the fight for hearts and minds, she is currently staring defeat in the face.It was around this time last week she was informed the Syrian regime had again dipped its murderous hands in its stocks of chlorine. When she saw footage of the incident, what she focused on was how the victims were huddled in an air raid shelter. ‘Those children were trying to find safety. And Assad still went after them,’ a government official said. ‘That affected her deeply.’ And it was at that moment that Mrs May began the emotional process of preparing herself to deploy British forces in a concerted way for the first time in her premiership.Unfortunately, this instinctive and humane decision that Assad’s barbarism could not go unpunished has proved her first mistake. Because it is not currently shared by a nation exhausted by austerity, scarred by the poisonous legacy of Iraq and scared of the prospect of a direct superpower confrontation.Mrs May has been playing catch-up with public opinion. On Thursday, a YouGov opinion poll showed only 22 per cent of Britons were in favour of a missile attack on Syria’s armed forces – and almost twice as many (43 per cent) were against. And a Mail on Sunday poll today reveals the public are opposed to her decision to bypass Parliament by a factor of two to one – and a vast majority are against her doing so again.During the week she went about carefully constructing the case for intervention, and the political and diplomatic coalition to implement it. On Tuesday and Wednesday, National Security Council briefings analysed open-source material that identified Syrian helicopter activity over Douma in the moments before the attack, and pieced it together with covert intelligence revealing Syrian air-command co-ordination.‘She will never be forgotten’: Tributes are paid to...Judge slams RSPB for sidestepping law by conducting covert...Share this articleOn Thursday she presented that evidence to Cabinet and invited contributions from all Ministers. Sajid Javid reportedly made a strong case condemning the failure to intervene in 2013, while Matt Hancock impressed colleagues – and May herself – with the argument that she had the authority to launch strikes without sub-letting the decision to Parliament.On Thursday evening she spoke to Donald Trump and reached a final agreement on the decision to launch a limited, proportionate attack.Finally, at 5pm on Friday, she met Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson at Chequers and signed off the specific strike packages for the RAF Tornados conducting the raids.But Mrs May neglected to engage with her most important partner of all – the British people. With the result that as UK servicemen prepared to take to the skies over the Mediterranean, their government appeared to have gone AWOL.Where Ministers should have been setting out the evidence, strategy and rationale behind military intervention, a vacuum was allowed to develop. One that was swiftly filled by everyone from the cyber-conspiracy theorists to Putin’s comical apologists and Jeremy Corbyn. Admittedly, as the week went on, the distinction between these disparate groups became harder to distinguish.But they were still easier to spot than members of the Government making a calm and compelling case for military action.There is such a case. In 2013 we were told the decision to draw back from action would spare lives. Instead, it sacrificed them. We were told a deal had been brokered between Putin and Assad to destroy Syria’s remaining chemical weapons. It was a lie. We were told negotiation offered the best path to peace. Russia’s own intervention, and selective deployment of her UN veto, shut that path down for good.But no one has been given licence to make that argument. The Prime Minister was correct, brave even, to take the decision air strikes did not need parliamentary approval – but then left Plymouth MP and former Commando Johnny Mercer to defend it in heroic isolation.On Friday she met Mercer in Downing Street where he urged her to take her arguments out into the country.Belatedly she followed his advice, mounting a solid defence of her actions at a press conference yesterday. But today that is where Mrs May remains. On the defensive.          We have now reached the incredible situation where two hostile foreign states and Her Majesty’s official opposition are operating in de-facto alliance to subvert the actions of the British GovernmentPrivately, Ministers say that now the requirements of operational security have been lifted, they are much freer to make an aggressive case for responding to Assad’s butchery. But they also concede they need to be more effective in disarming the Syria-Russia propaganda machine, or what could more accurately be called the Syria-Russia-Labour propaganda machine.We have now reached the incredible situation where two hostile foreign states and Her Majesty’s official opposition are operating in de-facto alliance to subvert the actions of the British Government.No sooner does a lie raise its head in Moscow, than it is dispersed through Vladimir Putin’s bot-farms, into the social media accounts of the Corbyn cultists and on to the Twitter pages of Labour MPs.It’s time for Mrs May to fight back. And her battlefield must not now be the skies over Syria but the Commons chamber. Tomorrow she appears in Parliament to deliver her statement on her decision to strike Assad. She, her Ministers and her party must take off the gloves and take the attack to their opponents.First, they must expose Jeremy Corbyn’s craven, self-righteous duplicity for what it is.His statements prove there is no act of brutality that will scar his conscience sufficiently for him to endorse a military response.‘Bombs won’t save lives or bring about peace,’ was his infantile reaction, implying he now supports unilateral conventional weapon disarmament along with nuclear unilateralism. Every sentence he utters has no practical purpose other than to act as a shield around Assad and his murderous regime.Corbyn does not want proportionate action – he wants no action.Then Mrs May and her colleagues must again destroy the fiction there is a ‘UN solution’ to the crisis.The pubs, supermarkets and school-runs of the nation do not echo to the sound of people delving deep into the inner workings of the UN Security Council. It needs to be explained clearly and concisely that Russia’s veto, coupled with Putin’s cynical surrogacy of Assad, makes the UN route a dead-end.Finally they must destroy the perverse fiction that inaction equates to security.If we allow maniacs such as Assad to toss chemical weapons around with impunity then it is not just Syrian children who will burn.In 2013, we failed to act because chemical weapons in the Middle East were supposedly ‘none of our business’.Five years later, they appeared on the streets of Salisbury.Last week the Prime Minister rightly took the lead in ordering British forces to redraw the red lines over the production, use and proliferation of chemical weapons. But she failed to take the British people with her. Tomorrow she must."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/08/4B2B69D800000578-5616915-Local_officers_are_hunting_the_clubgoer_who_abandoned_his_silver-a-1_1523776071150.jpg","title":"Drink driver goes run ploughing group revellers Blackpool","story":"    Police have arrested a \u0027drunk\u0027 driver who removed his car number plates and ploughed into a group of revellers after being ejected from a bar          Local officers are hunting the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on foot          Some clubs remain in lockdown - as local officers hunted the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on footLocal officers hunted the clubgoer, who abandoned his silver car and made off on foot.Many revellers say some clubs and pubs still remain in lockdown.Social media users were quick to react to the chaotic scenes, with one saying: \u0027Currently stuck in a club in Blackpool.

But I’ve discovered that a life without alcohol is simply not worth living (I’m sure I’ve become diluted from quaffing far too much San Pellegrino).There’s nothing to look forward to at the end of the day. No point sitting on a terrace with a beautiful view as, with no stem in your hand, all that’s left to do is fiddle with your phone.

I only managed to crawl down the aisle as my maid of honour and I had quaffed a magnum in my suite beforehand.And here’s the proof of the pudding (I’m eating a lot more puddings): I went on my first date without alcohol a couple of weeks ago. A man I’d once fancied more than any other in the world seen without wine goggles became boring, old and cantankerous.Drink makes us tolerant, which is why all those young women in short skirts staggering outside bars in Newcastle don’t feel the cold, or the despair of having no future (I’m not advocating becoming paralytic, just mellow).I suppose without it we make better choices – an excuse of a ‘very hungry cat’ so we can ask for the bill and go home alone – but shouldn’t the most important lifestyle choice be to be able to relax, enjoy a full stop at the end of a gruelling week? I wonder how people face the horror that is life without liquor: the rudeness of the French in St Tropez, say, or an unopened brown envelope on the mat.I have a couple of sanctimonious ‘friends’ who don’t drink, or drink very little. Even though they smoke, rarely exercise, snort coke, eat ready meals and supermarket sliced bread, still they would raise their brows as I recycled the Christmas empties. ‘Hmm, six bottles from, what, four days?’ ‘The dog knocked a glass over.’ ‘How on earth do you afford it?’ ‘I never had children.’Can you imagine: nine months of growing varicose veins and stretch marks and the prospect of no sleep for 25 years, unable to even sip something bubbly with your feet up.

Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.\u0027 Scores of fast jets, fighters and destroyers fired more than 100 missiles at three military targets in Syria on Friday night in retaliation for President Assad\u0027s chemical weapons attack on the rebel enclave of Douma on April 7.The Pentagon shared details early on Saturday of the successful, coordinated missile attack on Damascus which set the Syrian regime\u0027s chemical weapons program back \u0027years\u0027. At a press conference in Washington DC on Saturday morning, Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie gave a detailed break-down of the 105 missiles launched, saying: \u0027This is going to set the program back for years. We attacked the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program.\u0027The second site outside of Homs was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons  Bunker. It was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missilesHe also rejected the Syrian media\u0027s claim that Assad\u0027s missile defense systems took down 71 of the missiles launched, revealing that none were compromised and that they were only fired once the coordinated attack was over. Russia also claimed missiles had been intercepted. The first and largest target in the airstrikes was the Barzah Research and Development Center which was considered to be the \u0027heart\u0027 of the regime\u0027s chemical weapons program. The second target was the Hinshar Chemical Weapons Storage Facility. It was destroyed by  22 weapons including Scalp and Storm Shadows and three Naval cruise missiles.  The third target, the Hinshar CW Bunker, was hit by seven Scalp missiles.Three civilians were injured but there have been no confirmed fatalities.  On Saturday, the General said that if any deaths are reported they may well have been the result of Assad\u0027s counter fire. \u0027Syria shot 40 large missiles into the air using ballistic trajectory, without guidance. When we shoot iron into the air without guidance, it\u0027s going to come down somewhere,\u0027 he said. Boris Johnson said failure to response to Bashar Assad\u0027s use of illegal chemical weapons against his own people would have undermined \u0027civilised values\u0027.But amid fears of revenge attacks by Russia and criticism of Theresa May for acting without a Commons vote, Mr Johnson stressed there was no intention of getting more deeply involved in the Syrian civil war.Barzah Research Facility in northern Damascus was the main target of the attack.

The Pentagon said it gave no explicit warning. The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, John Huntsman, said in a video, \u0027Before we took action, the United States communicated with\u0027 Russia to \u0027reduce the danger of any Russian or civilian casualties.\u0027A Pentagon spokeswoman said that to her knowledge no-one communicated with Moscow other than to use a military-to-military hotline that has routinely helped minimise the risk of U.S.-Russian collisions or confrontations in Syrian airspace. Officials said this did not include giving Russian advance notice of where or when allied airstrikes would happen.France has continued to talk regularly with Russia even as East-West tensions have grown. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, hours before the Western missile strikes. Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundMan gets parking ticket from traffic warden sitting in his carShocking footage shows woman violently slam dog to the groundDisgusting moment ear wax build up removed in graphic videoCopperfield appears in court after being sued audience memberFriendly cat finds purrfect resting spot on the back of a horseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipTwo black men arrested for not \u0027ordering anything\u0027 in StarbucksRussia\u0027s ambassador to UN condemns airstrikes on SyriaUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundDisgusting moment ear wax build up removed in graphic videoMan gets parking ticket from traffic warden sitting in his carShocking footage shows woman violently slam dog to the groundFriendly cat finds purrfect resting spot on the back of a horseCopperfield appears in court after being sued audience memberAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipTwo black men arrested for not \u0027ordering anything\u0027 in StarbucksUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?Russia\u0027s ambassador to UN condemns airstrikes on SyriaSatellite images show the Barzah Research Center, the main target, before and after the missile attack which took place at 4am local time on Saturday, 9pm EST on Friday. 76 missiles pummeled this site alone  The second target was the Him Shinshar Chemical Weapons Storage site which was hit at the same time by 22 missiles  The third target, Him Shinshar CW Bunker, was the smallest and was wiped out by seven missiles           This graphic issued by the Pentagon on Saturday illustrates how the attacks unfolded from air and sea.

Fifty-seven of those were Tomahawk missiles and 19 were Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles.The Tomahawks were mostly fired from the USS Monterey, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser and the USS Higgins, USS Laboon and the USS John Warner submarine. France deployed its Mirage and Dassault Rafale jets and reportedly used four frigate warships. It is not clear how many aircraft were deployed. Britain is believed only to have fired missiles from its Torpedoes and Typhoon aircraft. Other ships from each nation\u0027s military were in the region, including the USS Donald Cook, but did not fire any weapons. Despite the attack, White said the US was still committed to a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the ongoing civil war in Syria.\u0027Our goal has not changed.

There won\u0027t be anything, or anyone, even close!\u0027 he tweeted.The phrase recalled a similar claim associated with President George W. Bush following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. Bush addressed sailors aboard a Navy ship in May 2003 alongside a \u0027Mission Accomplished\u0027 banner, just weeks before it became apparent that Iraqis had organized an insurgency that tied down U.S. forces for years. Russia proposed a motion at the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the airstrikes, but this was rejected with only Russia, China and Bolivia voting in favour.   Dashcam: Man appears to grapple with police officer on the groundMan gets parking ticket from traffic warden sitting in his carShocking footage shows woman violently slam dog to the groundDisgusting moment ear wax build up removed in graphic videoCopperfield appears in court after being sued audience memberFriendly cat finds purrfect resting spot on the back of a horseAuthorities call off search for mother who fell off cruise shipTwo black men arrested for not \u0027ordering anything\u0027 in StarbucksRussia\u0027s ambassador to UN condemns airstrikes on SyriaUS, UK and France air strikes in Syria: What do we know so far?

The painter, who died as a French Catholic named Léonard Foujita, had been born 81 years earlier as Tsuguharu Foujita, the son of a general in Japan’s imperial army.This year, celebrations marking the anniversary of his death, organised in Paris, Reims, Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, hope to bring him back from obscurity. For Foujita was one of the most successful artists of the 1920s, worshipped by the critics and art lovers who paid a fortune for his drawings, watercolours and oil paintings. As Paris’s shining art star, he was more successful than Picasso and more acclaimed than Matisse. Now he is the subject of a major exhibition at the Maillol Museum which focuses on the artist’s most prolific period, between 1913 and 1931.Brought up in a family open to western culture, Foujita was given French lessons from an early age. After studying western art at Tokyo’s fine arts school, he completed his training with a trip to Paris. Arriving on 6 August 1913, he knew immediately that he wouldn’t be returning home any time soon. That day, the Chilean painter Manuel Ortiz de Zárate, intrigued by Foujita’s distinctive and elegant look, introduced himself and the two became friends.The following day, Zárate took him to Picasso’s studio. There, in front of Picasso’s paintings and his collection of Le Douanier, Henri Rousseau, Foujita felt electrified.Too old to enrol in a second graduate course at the Beaux-Arts, he signed up as a copyist at the Louvre. Transfixed by antiquities and their stylised beauty, Foujita quickly realised he needed to adapt his vision, either in opposition to, or in conciliation with, western art. He chose hybridisation, a path that no other Japanese artist had dared take before. His unique style immediately fascinated both public and critics.His first solo exhibition, in June 1917 at Gallery Chéron, near the Champs-Élysées, was a triumph. His 110 watercolours sold out instantly.Picasso, who was among the first visitors and stayed for hours, left with as many canvases as he could afford and carry. To meet the high demand, Chéron, his dealer, who was also representing Modigliani and Soutine, asked him to produce two watercolours a day.Foujita had two secrets. The first one was called Fernande Barrey, a 24-year-old prostitute-turned-model who posed for Modigliani. He married her 13 days after meeting her at Café de la Rotonde on Boulevard du Montparnasse. The second was a thin brush, black and white paints, and a white glaze, the recipe for which he kept secret for years.Made of mixed flaxseed oil, crushed chalk or white lead, and magnesium silicate, it was unheard of in the west and gave his paintings a hypnotic, milky iridescence that fascinated viewers. His work stood in marked contrast to that of Matisse and Braque, who used large brushes and bright colours.Above all things, Foujita loved painting cats and naked women. Kiki de Montparnasse posed for him, and so did a new love, Lucie, barely 20 whom he also met at La Rotonde. Her skin was so white that he nicknamed her Youki – snow in Japanese.By the 1920s, Foujita was being exhibited and sold worldwide. Extravagance ruled. At Youki’s birthday, the artist gave her a convertible car with a radiator cap made of a small bronze by Rodin. Hugely successful, he spent all his money.Foujita found his look early: a short bowl haircut and small round glasses. He added to his celebrity status by drawing and making costumes that landed him in gossip columns and fashion magazines. He photographed and filmed himself as he worked. A great painter, he was also, unconsciously perhaps, building a brand. Increasingly, the artist became overshadowed by the dandy. In self-portraits, Foujita always appeared composed and inscrutable, but what did he really think of the avatar he had created?Youki had now become the mistress of his best friend, the poet Robert Desnos and France’s tax department started demanding huge sums, which the famous painter had forgotten to save. Having reached an impasse, Foujita escaped with a young model called Madeleine to South America. This is the point at which the exhibition at the Maillol Museum ends – but the story didn’t stop there, of course.From South America, he returned to Japan in 1933, becoming an official painter for the imperial army. He lent his talent to his country’s propaganda efforts throughout the second world war. However, protected by General MacArthur and rich American art collectors, he was allowed to return discreetly to Paris in 1950, accompanied by Kimiyo, his Japanese fifth wife.They settled in Montparnasse and led a quiet life. Foujita obtained French nationality in 1955 and converted to Catholicism, choosing the name of Léonard, as a tribute to Da Vinci. Forgiven and restored to the west, Foujita was finally buried in Reims, like a French king.Foujita, Painting in the Roaring 20s, is at the Maillol Museum, Paris, until 15 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ec4af7facc4574454795e76f67be1eec197a33/0_2758_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dcea5d28da4d3ed746e108e3e3eb023f 2600w","title":"objects of desire eight people name their favourite things","story":"An old typewriter, a wooden chair, a worn cuddly toy… The things we surround ourselves with loom large in our lives. Here, eight people reveal why they love the design of their prized possessionThe Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter This is widely regarded as the greatest typewriter of all time. It’s the best ergonomically it has a light action on the keyboard, but it still has a rhythm. It has an amazing set of features for a tiny machine. It has a half space insertion so you can delete a five-letter word with Tippex and then type it in again if it’s one letter longer you can do a half space and squeeze up words. It’s also got much more sophisticated tabulationI didn’t take possession of this olive green one until 1988 after my mother died. I have two of them and they were both hers. One my eldest brother in America sent to me. I think he had the one with the US keys rather than the UK keys. I move between the two. This one is from the early 50s so it’s nearly 70 years old. That’s a hell of an age for a machine to be in regular use.As a kid I was always going out to get typewriters. When I started to get obsessed about “writing” when I was nine or 10, you could go to a charity shop and get an old Underwood for a quid, at the point people were getting rid of them.I used to have a little collection of typewriters. I had three or four Imperial Good Companions, which is the typewriter Beryl Bainbridge used – a beautiful machine from the late 30s that really looks steam punk. Then I got obsessed by Groma Kolibris, which are in the film The Lives of Others. I love the thinness of it. It’s a beautiful machine. I was seriously thinking of getting a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball – Nietzsche had one. It looks like a porcupine with the keys in a ball all around it. I was becoming obsessed by super-early typewriters, super-tiny typewriters. But then I got rid of them all. I could see the beginning of the end of the whole typewriter shtick. They’re great machines, but they’re old. The Olivettis are the only two I have left.Shalom Simons really is the last typewriter repairman left in London. I haven’t been in touch with him for three or four years so I’m not even sure if he’s retired. This Olivetti does need work now, and may not last me the next book. I think: “Come on, Will, you’ve got to reconcile yourself with moving on and writing some other way.” It would be fine to write longhand and then type it up on a non-wireless enabled computer.I never learned to touch-type – I still have to peck to this day. The problem with writing on computers now is that it’s unbounded – you feel that the world is with you in your creative life and that’s not helpful. I like the noise of the typewriter and then the silence. When you work on a computer you have a continual ultrasonic whine of some kind. When you’re working on a typewriter you have these little bursts but then you stop and… silence.I’m not given to sentiment, but I felt very moved to be working on James Ballard’s old Olympia machine a few years back, to be channelling him to some extent. I’ve written a novel about my mum, How the Dead Live, and I’m always thinking about my mum in one way or another – she’s always lurking around and, just as with our parents we’ve got phrases that come up all the time, I’m sure there are lots of phrases in my novels that relate to her on the typewriter. It’s very evocative.Solid brass swan kitchen tap I like finding unique things and surrounding myself with objects I’ve collected. A lot of my kitchen, which I renovated myself, is salvage. The cupboards are butterfly cabinets from the Museum of Natural History and the tops are from an old chemistry lab – there’s a section that has some rude graffiti on it, which I love. I got the handmade Portuguese tiles while I was in Lisbon. They were once in the Ritz Hotel there.When the kitchen was nearly finished, everything was held up by the tap. I didn’t have one. I didn’t want a modern, clinical tap, I wanted something weird. I’m quite a control freak, for want of a better word, and I must have spent two weeks visiting every single bathroom shop in London and going on eBay at 2am. I was like a crazy person. Then I saw a picture of a golden swan tap in an old fashion shoot somewhere and I thought: “That’s the tap!”It was only about $30 on eBay. I think it’s 1970s or 80s. It’s got quite a Liberace vibe. Water comes out of the beak. Swans are quite aggressive and there’s something quite sexy about that. Of course, the builders said they couldn’t fit it because it wasn’t compatible with the pipes, but they had to sort it out because I said: “This is the only tap I’m having.”It’s solid brass and ornate and feels a little Indian. I grew up in India and my family is there. There is a famous Indian painting by Raja Ravi Varma with a swan in it and the tap always reminds me of that. The swan is the vehicle of Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge and creative arts. I have an image of her in the hallway. As a kid I used to read a lot of mythology and fairy tales so it reminds me of my childhood.After the kitchen was finished I bought the flat downstairs. But I loved everything about the kitchen upstairs so the builders had to move it all down, piece by piece. They told me the swan tap was broken on the inside and I totally panicked. I found a second one. This time it was almost £200, but I didn’t care. Then it turned out the other one wasn’t broken, so now that one is in the laundry room and I have two golden swan taps.Medici chair and table by Konstantin Grcic and MEME CCLII 2013 by Antony Gormley My abiding mantra is Gilbert and George’s “To be with art is all we ask,” and I have chosen three objects which I live with and look at every day: a Medici chair and table by Konstantin Grcic, an incredible designer, and a beautiful sculpture given to me by Antony Gormley when I left the Serpentine Gallery in 2016.To live with this chair and table is a joy. It is a gorgeous design and made of American walnut. If you live in London, as I do, it is very nice to see nature transformed into this glorious structure. I have two Medici chairs. They sit against the window in my sitting room, which looks on to playing fields, the table between them. My daughter’s toys sit beside them. I sit in one of the chairs every day, to read or write. There are no arms the chair feels very expansive. It is very comfortable, and that is unexpected it makes you do a double take. I am continually amused and surprised by that. When I look at it, I play with the angles. I think of constructivism and the great abstract artists and how they play with form. The chair is one of the most basic utilitarian objects, yet Konstantin has made it sublimely different.It is 39.5cm in length and made of solid iron, which naturally degrades. It is incredibly heavy relative to its size – its weight is a shock every time and somehow appropriate, given its incredible trajectory from ancient Greece to now. I am fascinated by the formal aspects of the sculptor’s work, its completeness and its scale. There is a novel, a short story, a poem, a haiku. This is a haiku – an extremely difficult thing to be able to do.I never touch it, partly because the weight of it makes it rooted, but I tweak the chairs. I want them to look their best, to show their better angles. The iron is a rich burnt red, but it is not uniform. The surface is slightly pitted it feels kind of gravelly. It is rough to the touch in the same way that the Medicis are silky smooth, like glass.The Gormley is tender. Can a chair be tender? No. But it can be so sensitively made that it gives the user an optimum experience of using it. That takes enormous consideration and care and sensitivity.

I love fungi. With these two, you can still see the soil at the base of each, and their gills, too. They are like fine, golden hairs. The resin block is 9cm high and 5.5cm wide. The colour is a bit de-saturated – it’s a sort of yellow. It catches the light.Mushrooms have mysterious qualities and a very interesting symbiosis with trees and plants. They grow like a neural network the mushroom itself is just the fruiting body of the organism that lives beneath the ground.These two were sent to me in the post by a mystery person. I opened up the parcel and I was shocked. It was like a gift from beyond. It was the best way to woo me. The sender, who I’d only met on Instagram, later became my boyfriend.When I first got into make-up, after studying industrial design at uni, I read a lot about fungi’s psychotropic effects and their possible links with the birth of religion, and also about Carl Jung and the symbolism of objects.Fungi seemed to be a bridge between life and death. Because of their mind-expanding properties, they also represent new ways of looking at the world. I am not into drugs, but my own work is an organic process and this object is also symbolic of a connection between it and nature. I absolutely love nature.My resin mushrooms live in my bathroom on one of three shelves filled with objects I have collected from around the world. It’s a little museum space.My work is concept-led and it’s about building a character and having a narrative. I use make-up as a tool to communicate a person and their life. It’s why this object is one of the most precious things I own – there is such a big back story to it.Tom Ford Beauty’s Extrême Collection with Isamaya Ffrench is available at SelfridgesKitsound Ribbon in-ear wireless headphones I am a restless person. I’m on the move a lot, even in my house. I like to be entertained at all levels of life and to take in information via news programmes and podcasts and things like that.I don’t really like silence, unless it’s filled with my thoughts. Design is something that seamlessly slots into your life: my clothes, the tech I use, the bike I ride, kitchenware. I try to prioritise function I am not someone who thinks about beauty that much. I like things to be clean, tidy and functional. If it looks good, that’s a bonus.What would I feel lost without? Headphones. I carry them with me every day. But they break after a while, as my old ones did, and it’s normally the wire. I’d been thinking about getting a wireless pair for a while, but I didn’t want to sink a whole lot of money into them. These cost me less than £15.They make life easier for me. I no longer feel restricted. They are moulded plastic and black. Incognito. I don’t like my things to stand out. They are super small and super convenient they slip into a pocket. I’ve noticed that if I am listening to something really interesting I won’t take them out when I get home, like I used to do with my old headphones. I keep listening. They are part of me.Renni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I Am No Longer Talking to White People About Race is £7.64 from guardianbookshop.comTeddy dog cuddly toy DogDog is a teddy dog, my sleeping toy, and my most prized possession ever. I got him when I was five. I find him aesthetically very pleasing. I like his shape – the simplicity of his roundness, and of his markings. I sleep with him in between my neck and my shoulder. Every night. I can’t sleep without him. Weird, as I’m quite old now.As a designer, I love symmetry – asymmetrical hems are my pet hate. DogDog has a patch on one eye, but otherwise he is very symmetrical and pleasing to the eye. He’s never had a plastic nose or hard, plastic eyes – his are far apart, which is a sign of beauty.If you took him apart, you could make a beautiful pattern, a huge cut-out with fluid lines.I love my designs to be out there and quirky, but I have a limit to how many things I put together.I might design something in aqua blue and black, then put in a cream lace. Looking at DogDog, he is perfect like that: he has a two-tone element, his sandy, camel body, and the surprise of his eye patch. Otherwise, he is quite simple, quite chic. I can imagine him in a beautiful apartment in Tokyo, or in a calming villa in the south of France with whitewashed walls and lavender dried in bags. He would wear a straw hat in the sun.People say I should to go Tokyo, that there I would be normal. Everyone walks around with their teddies.On the shoot I changed positions with him. I got really excited that I could sit in his lap for once, in his arms.Venetian brass mask This little mask is so small you could hold it in the palm of your hand. It has nil value. It has no function. But whenever I look at it, I remember the time I slept in Venice railway station at the end of a long trip – a time of introspection.During my first summer break from Rada I decided to go Interrailing. I must have been about 21. I’d moved to London from Liverpool – I knew from early on in my life that I needed to get away from home, which was not a particularly happy place for me – and I found London difficult. It was expensive and unfriendly.I had one of those wonderful tickets where you could go anywhere and I planned a route through Holland, Belgium, France, Austria, Germany. I had the Rough Guide with me but when I got to Venice, I couldn’t find anywhere to sleep. There was a sort of homeless section outside the station, so I stayed there. I felt vulnerable. I worried about closing my eyes.Walking around Venice, there were strange masks everywhere, flat-faced masks with big noses, masks worn with monkish robes. They were almost scary in their absence of design.I didn’t know anyone in Venice. I had to make myself known to people, step outside of myself. When you are travelling, you are finding out who you are and trying on different personalities and attitudes to life. I bought the mask to remind me of that time.It’s about the size of a decent pebble, and there’s something about its weight I like. It lives in a large printer’s drawer that’s hung on the wall of my study.This mask really has character. Its surface is not smooth – it has real crinkles – and its inside is unfinished and sandpapery. Its expression is surprised, slightly quizzical, which I love. Its eyes are far too close together. When it looks at me, or when I look at it, rather, its expression changes, depending on my mood, or the light, or what day it is.Taking it down for the shoot felt really terrible. I felt sort of disloyal to the other objects. Like, why take that? I took it because I knew it would survive. It is the most solid thing there. Also, it marked the furthest point I got to in Europe – though it was not the end of the journey.I know exactly how to put it back – there is a patch of dust around its place – and I can’t wait to take it back, to complete the picture.The City and the City starring David Morrissey is currently on BBC21950s Italian coffee percolator When my grandmother passed away I got quite a lot of her stuff and this 1950s Italian coffee-maker is something I still use regularly. It’s an old-fashioned aluminium stove-top percolator. You put the boiling water in the bottom and the coffee on top, then you turn it upside down, and the water percolates through – basically it was a long-drip style coffee-maker before its time.My grandmother was Italian and I grew up drinking coffee so I’ve been using this since I was a teenager. I’d much rather have an espresso than a cup of tea. My grandmother moved to Wales from Bardi when she was 19, so I imagine she bought it on one of her trips back to Italy.I’m not into new gadgets. My kitchen is full of old clutter. I’ve just bought a load of Richard Ginori plates from Florence and an antique turbot cooker. I collect Poole Pottery and Elizabeth David cookbooks, too. We’re such a throwaway society. Things aren’t built to last a lifetime and I think it’s a tragedy.

The item is shifted off its shelf by human or robot and on to a chain of delivery mechanisms that takes it to your door. That item, and millions others like it, plus the machinery that handles them, needs space. The more we shop online, the more such space is needed.You’ll know all this, I expect, but you may only be dimly aware of the physical consequences: very big boxes, getting bigger and more numerous. Higher, too, as robotic distribution systems allow goods to be piled further from the ground than before.These boxes are of such importance that some are classed as “nationally significant infrastructure projects”, which means that national government rather than local authorities give them planning permission. Some are shrouded in secrecy. They are where the virtual becomes physical, with a vengeance. Their scale challenges the conventions of town and country planning, pushing their designers and creators to find more or less convincing ways to respond.Imagine the space that is used to store and display a product in a traditional shop, and then imagine great dollops of it sucked from almost every high street and supermarket in the land to a centralised facility. Add it to the long-established need for physical shops to warehouse their goods. You end up with something like Dirft – the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal – near Rugby, or the Magna Parks in Milton Keynes and Lutterworth: town-sized agglomerations, containing thousands of workers, made up of very big sheds. They are called distribution centres, which differ from what used to be called warehouses in the degree to which the buildings are integrated into logistical networks of trucks, trains, the internet and subsidiary distribution points.The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas argues that the modern countryside is now ided into two types: on the one hand industrialised agriculture with the big structures that serve it, on the other landscapes preserved for their picturesque beauty. Dirft confirms his point. It stands close to the pretty Northamptonshire village of Crick, with its medieval church of St Margaret’s (Grade I listed, notable Romanesque font), also to the pleasant rolling countryside of Warwickshire (Shakespeare’s county, as the sign on the border says). Dirft itself consists of colossal distribution centres from which retailers dispatch their produce, via the nearby M1, across the country. Here is an abstracted high street of the nation in which the buyable contents of a home – food, furnishings, hardware, clothes – are translated into vast labelled containers: Tesco, Sainsburys, Bathstore, Halfords.The Dirft development’s origins lie in the mid-90s, when a freight rail connection was established, via Felixstowe docks and the then new Channel tunnel, into something called the Trans-European Transport Network. As the area had already been designated, in 1978, as a “motorway orientated growth point” the addition of the railport made it exceptionally fertile ground for the bumper crops of big sheds that then started to blossom there. There are now more than 6m sq ft of building with another 7.7m on the way.Dirft is no prettier than its name and doesn’t claim to be so. It is a landscape of those mute boxes and of the roads, loading areas and parking zones they need to sustain them, the earth vigorously reshaped to make the flat platforms on which they stand. It is made of fences, berms and security gates, of young trees in their protective tubes and gnarled old ones, survivors of the site’s former rural life. A pitched-roofed Ibis hotel adds a note of forlorn domesticity. Wind turbines turn.You couldn’t call it country or town: it is a node, a zone. It approaches a sort of sublime, you could say, in which the vast whiteish rectangles resemble conceptual art and the engineered terrain unwittingly becomes land art. Its scale is that of the national and international networks of which it is part, not the locality.The complex is surprisingly uncontentious, given its size and impact, among the local community. “It is positive”, says Josie Flavell of Crick parish council “in that a number of residents are employed by the many companies at Dirft.” She is pleased that Prologis, the company that owns the site, contributes towards two police community support officers, organises litter removal, pays for cycling and pedestrian routes and financed a heritage board to be placed at the site of the old Kilsby and Crick railway.Simon Bowers, of Daventry district council, also likes the jobs it brings. “It’s a valued part of the local economy,” he says. “It’s an appropriate development that does no real harm.”But, in a country where land is as constrained as in Britain, where it is a struggle to find space for other such essentials as new housing, the growth of big sheds is particularly hard to accommodate. If it is a fast-moving business, wherein a building 10 times the volume of St Paul’s Cathedral might go up in six months, it might take a decade to assemble a site out of former farmland, and win planning permission for it. In Lutterworth there is a campaign group called Magna Park Is Big Enough, which in January persuaded the local council to refuse, by a margin of two votes, a planned expansion. One meeting of the group was held in a hangar to accommodate the number of protesters.There is, therefore, a motivation to “innovate in a mindful and respectful way”, as Gazeley, owner of the Magna Parks, put it. Last year Creative Review magazine spotted a trend, a “new breed of superstructures trying very hard to disappear”. Off the M5, for example, near Bridgwater in Somerset, a huge Morrisons distribution centre is clad in long horizontal strips of varying shades of green, the better to blend with the lush West Country landscape. Magna Park in Milton Keynes, home to John Lewis, Waitrose and River Island, a mile-plus-long, 4m sq ft array, is uniformly banded with gradations of blue, from dark at the bottom to pale at the top. The intention is that it will fade into the sky.It depends on the location, explains Tim Ward of Chetwoods, the architects of the Milton Keynes Magna Park and a number of other distribution centres. If the structures are generally viewed with landscape behind, green works well if sky, blue is better. There is, he says, some art to the choice of tones that includes a knowledge of the latest developments in the technology of colour.Chetwoods are keen to stress that they don’t want the structures to disappear, exactly – a futile task, given the enormous size of the buildings – but rather to be less intrusive. Indeed, you are conscious of Magna Park Milton Keynes from miles around – an insistent, astounding, blueish presence that occupies the horizon from end to end, an alternative atmospheric that keeps reappearing down country lanes, from new housing estates and across fields. Or, if you are driving along the M1, it is an azure-cerulean abstraction, flipping past the edge of vision for an appreciable interval of time.The striking thing about it is less the breaking-up of its bulk than the consistency of the pattern across such an expanse of surface. There may never before have been so much synthetic blueness in one place.Colour, in any case, only gets you so far. Gazeley like to talk of the million trees they have planted at Lutterworth to create a publicly accessible “Magna Wood” and “the wildlife-rich Mere Lane Lagoon fishing lake.” At Milton Keynes a pond captures and attenuates the rainwater that falls on the development’s expanses of roof. There are swans, moorhens and many species of tree. There is a “bee hotel”. There is an uplifting, if artistically dubious, statue of the Olympic long jumper Greg Rutherford on the roundabout at the entrance to the complex. As befits the home of Waitrose, Magna Park has a palpable quality and coherence in its layout, but even blunt Dirft has measures to buffer its impact with landscape.Gazeley are particularly proud of Altitude, a new distribution centre on their Milton Keynes site that is not only an unusually high 21 metres but also has a roof ready to be covered by photovoltaic cells, at such time as they become economically viable. The health and wellbeing of employees will be supported by such things as good lighting and ventilation and reindeer moss growing on living walls inside the building. New technology is reducing the number of jobs in the business, I’m told, but many of those that remain are becoming more skilled, which means that companies have to try harder to attract good\u0026nbspstaff.Laurie Chetwood of Chetwoods says that distribution centres, which are among the most single-minded of building types, must now acquire a “duality of purpose”, which means things such as making running tracks out of the fire engine lanes that surround the boxes. He talks of cladding that can double as batteries to store solar energy gathered on the roof. One day, maybe, it might be possible to charge electric trucks with it, which would mitigate the rather obvious ecological drawbacks of dispatching thousands of HGVs across the country every day.Simple as they may look, distribution centres are sophisticated structures. The machinery that moves stuff around is constantly evolving. Their playing field-sized floors have to be exceptionally level, as small unevenness could cause the high fork-lift trucks they use to lean unacceptably at the top. Years of competition have made their structure as spare and economical as can be. Architects such as Chetwoods have to reconcile all this with the wishes of users (who might want something tailored to their needs) and of investors, who will want a structure to be adaptable to future users.It is tempting to say that these buildings make the internet visible, except that their visibility is strictly limited. Sometimes they get into the news when reporters, posing as warehouse workers, bring news of working conditions inside. You can get a glimmer on Google, for example from employee reviews of Primark’s warehouse, which sits like an acropolis on a raised earthwork in Northamptonshire: “they’re treating a people like nothing,” says one in imperfect English “they beautiful lied on induction how much they cares about worker, don’t believe them.” The buildings, however, remain notably blank,\u0026nbspgiving almost no clue of their busy inner lives.Some users and owners are dismissive of press inquiries to a degree unusual in big, public relations-conscious companies. Tesco refused a request to see inside their Dirft base, which was possibly not surprising, but also to answer simple questions, such as: what are its dimensions?For the writer Carolyn Steel, whose book Hungry City: How Food Shapes Our Lives examines the relationship of society to food, this secrecy is the antithesis of the more public processes by which food once progressed from field to market to kitchen to plate. “The exchange of food used to bring people together,” she says. “Now the process is designed to exclude the human”. But distribution centres manifest the world we have chosen and had chosen for us, in return for efficiency and convenience, in which a product appears in the home by ever more inscrutable magic.Their scale and growth are a consequence of the fact that all that physicality and volume\u0026nbspthat the virtual world displaces has to go somewhere. It’s welcome that architects and developers should try to make something of them and to mitigate their impact with woods, ponds and indeed coloured bands. But, short of a dramatic restructuring of the economic, technical and social basis of the modern world, these uncompromising building types will only become more essential to our lives. The contrast between\u0026nbspwhat was previously thought of as natural and urban landscape will only become\u0026nbspmore stark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/316262e8595a92a11c553d7fb679c799c6b11ed9/0_151_4519_2712/master/4519.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d5391a1c427e9aeda69de5f510398d4e 1240w","title":"martin sorrell steps down as head of wpp advertising agency","story":"Longest-serving FTSE 100 chief quits before findings of personal misconduct inquiry are disclosedSir Martin Sorrell has resigned from WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct.The 73-year-old, who acquired a small Kent-based maker of wire baskets in 1985 and built it into the world’s largest marketing services group, told staff that for him WPP and its future is “more important than a matter of life or death”.It may not seem like it but Sir Martin Sorrell had a career before WPP.

He stepped down on 14 April“As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business,” said Sorrell. “That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside.“As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that. Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you … now Back to the Future.”Sorrell, the longest-serving FTSE 100 chief executive, has been under increasing pressure since the allegation of personal misconduct was made public by WPP’s board this month.WPP’s board, which had appointed independent legal counsel to investigate the allegation, was expected to receive the findings of the investigation at the end of next week.Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, has taken the role of executive chairman until a replacement for Sorrell can be found.WPP has appointed two longstanding WPP executives from ad group Wunderman – Mark Read and Andrew Scott – as joint chief operating officers to run day-to-day operations.WPP said Sorrell would be “available to assist with the transition”.Sorrell himself said: “For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP. We have had a succession plan in place for some time. We have weathered difficult storms in the past. And our highly talented people have always won through, always. As some of you know, my family has expanded recently, WPP will always be my baby too.”Quarta has said there is an “exceptional team of potential candidates” from WPP’s top management, as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”. However, investors and analysts believe that, given the scale of WPP, Sorrell’s successor must be an external candidate.WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate advertising businesses working in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries.Whoever takes on WPP will find keeping the sprawling empire – autocratically run with an iron hand with what has been dubbed “Sorrellcentricity” – intact perhaps an impossible task.Observers believe that Sorrell’s departure will have rapid and catastrophic ramifications for WPP and the wider global advertising eco-system. “Martin falls, WPP falls,” said one senior advertising executive at a rival global holding company. “There will be chaos. The industry is not prepared, clients are not prepared. In the short term there will be chaos. The advertising industry is run like show business. It’s all about short-termism and that’s the problem.” Sorrell has come under increasing pressure in the last year as WPP, which has a market capitalisation of £15bn, has struggled resulting in its share price falling more than a third – wiping £9bn off the value of the business. WPP recently reported its worst performance since the advertising recession in 2009, which Sorrell described as “not a pretty year”.Sorrell is one of the UK’s best-paid business leaders, earning more than £200m from pay and lucrative – and highly controversial – reward schemes in the last five years alone. His £70m payout in 2015 was one of the biggest in UK corporate history.To everyone at WPP, For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP. Over those decades, our family has grown and prospered. We welcomed J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy, Young \u0026amp Rubicam, Grey, 247 Real Media, Taylor Nelson Sofres, among so many others. We created GroupM, including Xaxis and Essence. We put the focus on Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Central Eastern Europe, the home of the next billion consumers. We embarked on the early development of digital capabilities and the evolution of a firm-wide integrated client and country-centered approach. Our holding company was recognized as the world’s best and most effective through the Cannes Lions and Effie Awards year after year after year.We pioneered Atticus Awards for original written thinking… the WPP Fellowship Awards to recognize promising talent… the Partnership and Practice Awards for client endorsed integrated market and case studies. Our Stream digital conferences have attracted the best in the digital business for more than a decade.Our Annual Sustainability and Pro Bono Reports highlight the unique social, environmental and public policy work that we do day in, day out across the globe.  As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business, our over 200,000 people and their 500,000 or so dependants, and the clients we serve in 112 countries.  That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all shareowners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside. We have had a succession plan in place for some time. A new generation of management, led by Mark Read and Andrew Scott (who have each been at WPP for approximately 20 years), are well qualified and experienced in the board’s opinion, to deal with the geographic and technological opportunities and challenges our industry faces.We have weathered difficult storms in the past. And our highly talented people have always won through, always.Nobody, either direct competitors or newly-minted ones can beat the WPP team, as long as you work closely together, whether by client andor country or digitally. In the coming period, I will be available to the board and any of you, should you want help with anything, anywhere. I shall miss all of you greatly. You have given me such excitement and energy and I wanted to thank you for everything you have done and will do for WPP and me. As some of you know, my family has expanded recently, WPP will always be my baby too.As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.

Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6466bed5c1442745758198465dff697f6a46f075/253_37_2007_1204/master/2007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ee7b925803d0444dbe730860c8b5b2fc 1240w","title":"safeguards trampled on mps vote syria caroline lucas","story":"By refusing to engage parliament Theresa May has shown contempt for parliamentary democracyThe launch of military action in Syria is a deeply troubling move. And the fact that the timing seems to have been dictated at least in part by a prime minister running scared of a parliamentary vote is little short of scandalous.By refusing to engage parliament on the issue, Theresa May has shown a contempt for parliamentary democracy, and trampled over an important safeguard against unwanted military action.As a result, we’ve found ourselves rushing headfirst into striking a foreign nation alongside a trigger-happy US president when there is little evidence to suggest that our actions will make a positive difference, and much to suggest that they could make matters worse. To intervene militarily before Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons inspectors have even been able to investigate the site is also deeply concerning.The risks of escalation are real. Only on Friday the UN secretary general said “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Russia has already threatened to attack the “source” of any missiles aimed at Syria – and I fear mission creep leading to any attempted “regime change” imposed by the west.Look at Libya, at the rise of Isis in Iraq, at the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan – the long-term impacts of our recent military interventions are a bloody stain on our country’s record. Syria is a tinderbox, the theatre for proxy wars by numerous different actors, and is already deepening the tensions between Israel and Iran. To drop bombs on Assad without a serious, thought-out strategy, and a plan about what happens next, risks making a horrific situation even worse. Even if early indications are that the regime, Russia and Iran will shrug this off in military terms, they will certainly milk it for propaganda and make the search for peace even harder. There is, of course, much that we can be doing. We should be cracking down on Russia through further sanctions and pursuing diplomatic channels. It’s worth noting that US sanctions against Russia are finally beginning to have an effect. New US sanctions on seven oligarchs, 17 top officials and 12 companies led to tens of billions of dollars in losses on Russian markets within just a few hours on Monday, and the rouble recently suffered its biggest daily fall in over three years. We now need to double down on these actions.And Britain urgently needs to get its own house in order if we want to be a positive influence on the world stage. That means ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia, standing up to the aggression of the Israeli government and playing our part as a nation of peace building.The attacks may have already started, but some semblance of democracy must now be restored. Theresa May must bring a debate and, crucially, a vote to parliament on Monday – and give MPs an unwhipped say on these strikes.

We have met with tens of thousands of people from El Paso, Texas, to South Charleston, West Virginia, to Selma, Alabama, where we met Callie, gathering testimonies from poor people and listening to their demands for a better society. On Tuesday, we announced a Poor People’s Campaign Moral Agenda, a set of demands that is drawn from this listening tour, as well as an  audit of America we conducted with allied organizations, including the Institute for Policy Studies and the Urban Institute, 50 years after the original Poor People’s Campaign. As grim as the situation was in 1968, the appalling truth is deep inequalities still exist and, in some ways, we are worse off. In the last eight years alone, 23 states have passed voter suppression laws – gutting the Voting Rights Act civil rights leaders helped secure more than a half century ago. This is the true hacking of our democracy, allowing people to win office who deny healthcare, living wages, cut necessary social programs and push policies that promote mass incarceration, hurt immigrants and devastate our environment.These racist laws hurt not just people of color, but poor whites whose lives are upended by the politicians put in office by the violent extremism that is voter suppression. Coretta Scott King would call all of this violence. She’d say that violence isn’t just killing people with guns, but denying them living wages, allowing them to live in ghetto housing. We rightfully get in the streets and protest when the police shoot unarmed black men, but we must also stand up to the public policy violence that is ravaging our society. We must no longer allow attention to violence to keep the poor, people of color and other disenfranchised people down.People are poor not because they are lazy, not because they are unwilling to work hard, but because politicians have blocked living wages and healthcare and undermined union rights and wage increases. Our nation’s moral narrative is shaped by Christian nationalists whose claims run contrary to calls in the Scripture, which is very clear that we need to care for the poor, immigrants and the least among us.  If you claim to be evangelical and Christian and have nothing to say about poverty and racism, then your claim is terribly suspect. There needs to be a new moral discourse in this nation – one that says being poor is not a sin but systemic poverty is. The Moral Agenda we announced on Tuesday demands a massive overhaul of the nation’s voting rights laws, new programs to lift up the 140 million Americans living in poverty, immediate attention to ecological devastation and measures to curb militarism and the war economy. We call for major changes to address systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative, including restoration and expansion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, repeal of the 2017 federal tax law, implementation of federal and state living wage laws, universal single-payer healthcare and clean water for all.  To make sure these demands are heard, poor and disenfranchised people from coast to coast are preparing for 40 days of action centered around statehouses and the US Capitol. Over six weeks this spring, people of all races, colors and creeds are joining together to engage in nonviolent moral fusion direct action, massive voter mobilization and power building from the bottom up.  To prepare for the 40 days, poor and disenfranchised people, clergy and advocates will participate in nonviolent direct-action trainings across the country on Saturday. Now, 50 years after leaders of the 1968 Poor People’s Campaign declared silence was betrayal, we are coming together to break the silence and tell the truth about the interlocking evils of systemic racism, poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and our distorted moral narrative. All over the country, poor people like Callie are joining together, with support from clergy and advocates. As she said on Tuesday in unveiling our demands: “We not going to keep crying. We’re going to march, we’re going to protest and we’re going to vote.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b75973cb8b8b72b0febbbb7930ca6fb6b0716e1/79_13_2421_1453/master/2421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ed683791fefc5109c88548be29da815 1240w","title":"provocateur katie hopkins perfect symbol tribal age","story":"A new play imagines her murder but its real subject is how public debate has been reduced to causing and feeling outrageI have not seen the play, but I am going to write about it. Which seems an apt metaphor for the current state of public debate, an issue that lies at the heart of The Assassination of Katie Hopkins.It’s a musical, written by Chris Bush\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMatt Winkworth, that opens this week at the Theatr Clwyd, in Mold, north Wales, before transferring to London. And, even before it opens, it has generated much controversy. Hopkins, as might be expected, is none too pleased. “If you are black you are protected by your colour,” she wrote at the beginning of the year. “If you are Muslim – by your religion... But as a straight, white, conservative I am an acceptable target, unprotected by my honesty, and fair game for physical attack.The irony is that the musical itself asks that very question. (I might not have seen the play, but I have viewed some of the rehearsals and read the script.) It might be a clickbait title, but The Assassination of Katie Hopkins is not about Hopkins, but about society’s response to a figure like Hopkins. Its real target is the pettiness of public debate – and the double standards of many liberals.The play opens with Hopkins’s murder at a public event. A human rights charity, wanting not to look callous, decides it must find something nice to say about Hopkins for her memorial. Kayleigh, who is given the task of compiling a list of Hopkins’s positive qualities, comes to idolise her. Hopkins was, Kayleigh remarks, a “strong, unapologetic woman”, who speaks honestly without “waiting to see which way the wind was blowing”.Kayleigh ends up starting a new campaign called Justice for Katie. She appears on TV, defending not just Hopkins but also hate speech, which she redefines as “passion”.The play is a satire on the polarised character of public debate. The only choice we seem to have is either to demonise a figure such as Hopkins or to lionise her as “a strong, unapologetic woman”.This tribal quality to debate can be seen in almost every sphere of public life, from Brexit to Zionism. The problem is not polarisation as such – politics, after all, is about taking sides – but the shallowness of political debate and attachments. It seems to matter less what people say than to which political or cultural tribe they belong. Inevitably, this has cut against a willingness both to listen to others and to scrutinise our own beliefs. Debate too has often become reduced to a ritual of provoking outrage and of being outraged. The kind of social interaction that began as online trolling seems to have invaded much of the public sphere. And this is as true of the right as it is of the left.Hopkins is a perfect symbol of such an age. There are many people in the world, from atheist bloggers in Bangladesh to Christian voices in China, who do “say the unsayable” and show great courage in challenging accepted norms.Hopkins is not one of them. She is a provocateur whose aim is to generate outrage. She succeeds because so many liberals rise to the bait, turning a shallow nonentity into a martyr for free speech.There is a more profound issue, too. In demonising a figure such as Hopkins, we often give a free pass to politicians and institutions that are far more influential in promoting reactionary ideas, both in policy and in shaping public opinion.Consider one of her most infamous columns for the Sun, in which she described refugees as “cockroaches” and called for gunboats to “drive them back to their shores”. It was an obnoxious, hate-filled piece that drew a torrent of outrage.Yet I am always struck by how silent liberals are when it comes to the actual use by European nations of gunboats against refugees and the attempt to wall off Europe by paying millions to the most unsavoury regimes from Turkey to Eritrea to Libya to lock up would-be immigrants in hell-hole detention centres just out of sight of Brussels, Paris and London.If half the energy expended on denouncing Hopkins had been used to challenge European migration policy, migrants might be in a better place now. But, then, to have done so would not have satisfied the demand for cheap outrage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01546b9f20e8f689757ab9cefb9cd2e04da05910/0_36_4007_2404/master/4007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ec7291971286b85c38b87e143f9410ff 1240w","title":"syria assad doing nothing disastrous policy missile strikes","story":"After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter catastropheLet’s cut the canting. No one thinks, not those ordering them and not those opposing them, that the missile strikes against the Assad regime will influence the outcome of the catastrophe in Syria. That pass was sold long since. If there was an opportunity for America, Britain and their allies to make a difference for the better, the chance was missed many, many deaths ago. What we are witness to – on the part of both the leaders of the western democracies and their critics – is a tableau of actors striking postures designed to make the players feel better about themselves. This posing can never rewrite the blood-drenched history of a seven-year conflict that has turned Syria into a charnel house and shredded international norms about the conduct of war.The proximate cause of this crisis is the chemical attack on Douma last weekend. After years of unmasterly inactivity by the democracies, it is that atrocity that drew attention back to what is happening in Syria and finally stirred punitive action against Bashar al-Assad. In the words of the ineffable Donald Trump, the retaliatory strikes are supposed to demonstrate to “animal Assad” that there is a “price to pay” for the dictator’s use of banned weaponry. In the more measured language of Theresa May, “we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to be normalised”. Yet the normalisation of chemical weapons is precisely what has already happened in Syria. Assad’s regime has time and again used chemical warfare to slaughter its own people, as it has also deployed hideous “conventional” weapons such as dropping barrel bombs and fuel-air bombs on civilian areas to inflict mass casualties.Over seven years of relentless savagery in Syria, the hands of the leaders of the western powers have been wedged firmly under their bottoms. They have been encouraged to maintain this impotent posture by legislators too feeble to grip the dilemmas posed by Syria and voters weary of engagement with the hard parts of the world. Listening to both their public pronouncements and their private calculations, the abiding impression is that this belated and limited action by Washington, London and Paris is not driven by any conviction that these strikes will make any meaningful difference. They won’t even stop Assad manufacturing more chemical weapons if he chooses to do so. Missiles are flying mainly to soothe guilt about repeated earlier failures to act.Even so, I give these leaders a little more credit than I can find for those whose only counsel is to do absolutely nothing. At least some of these belated interventionists are wrestling with a genuine dilemma. Action over this chemical attack, when so many previous atrocities have been given a free pass, looks like therapy by Tomahawk, a gesture, not a strategy. But to let yet another use of chemical weapons happen without any form of response would have given a complete sense of impunity to the Assad regime and its sponsors in the Kremlin. Every dictatorship on the planet has been getting the message that there is no penalty for the acquisition and use of weapons prohibited since the First World War and that has chilling implications for future conflicts.The other side of our tableau of posturers is composed of those who oppose this action as they have clamoured against all previous attempts to do something about Syria. The non-interventionists come in two categories. There are the “it’s nothing to do with us” brigade who declare that “we haven’t got a dog in the Syrian fight”. Mainly to be found on the hand-washing right, the cold brutality with which they express their indifference to so much human suffering has the sole merit of being candid.Less honest, not least with themselves, are the self-proclaimed peace-lovers. Mainly to be found on the hand-wringing left, they are too busy looking in the mirror admiring their own halos to face the moral challenges posed by a situation like Syria. Jeremy Corbyn opposes this weekend’s action on the grounds that it “risks escalating further” what is “an already devastating conflict”. The Labour leader and those who share his worldview are consistent. Do nothing has been their unvaried policy for the past seven years of carnage. There is no doubt that they can expect support from a lot of a domestic electorate turned allergic to engaging with abroad, especially the Middle East.As the non-interventionists have preached inaction, the death toll in Syria has been remorselessly – what’s the word, Jeremy? – escalated by the Assad regime and its allies. Whenever pressed to say what they would do, the non-interventionists fall back on calling for “negotiations” and more effort at the United Nations. They have to be aware that Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to shield Assad from any effective action by the UN, most recently by blocking an independent investigation into the chemical attack on Douma. While the non-interventionists have talked about talking, the Assad regime and its backers in the Kremlin and Iran have been free to go on killing.Some argue that the fatal turning point was the summer of 2013 when Assad’s use of chemical weaponry\u0026nbspdefied a “red line” drawn by Barack Obama, who then failed to enforce it. That has become the main reference point of the British argument because it was then that David Cameron failed to secure parliamentary\u0026nbspapproval for participation in punitive air strikes. When MPs turned him down, the then prime minister abandoned any further effort with a huffy “I get that”. The people who really “got it” were the Syrian civilians who continued to die in their thousands.It is possible that intervention at that point might have made some difference. In truth, the west made its gravest decision not to act earlier when Assad responded with vicious suppression to the original uprising against his dictatorship in 2011. Rather than offer succour to the secular democrats who rebelled against the regime, the west stood by as he imprisoned, tortured, executed and crushed those who cried out for freedom. Every force in Syria was provided with resources and weapons except for the liberal opposition. Humanitarian initiatives could have been attempted, such as creating safe havens for civilians and imposing no-fly zones to impede Assad’s ability to slaughter his own people. They weren’t even tried. No meaningful pressure was applied to bring him to the negotiating table. The opposition become dominated by jihadists. Regional powers and Russia moved into the voids left by western inaction.It is not provable whether earlier intervention would have altered the course of Syria’s tragic history. Non-interventionists said then, as they say now, that anything that the west does only makes things worse. That we can’t prove either. What we can see is how bad things have become and it is hard to conceive how exactly it could be worse. After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter disaster in every respect.The United Nations struggles to put an exact figure on how many people have died, but best estimates put the number at around half a million. More than 5 million Syrians are refugees abroad and more than 6 million have been internally displaced. Assad has flattened cities and smashed through nearly every international taboo about the conduct of war. The Syrian dictator is massacring his way to victory and there is no one who thinks that this weekend’s missile strikes will in any way impede him. The conflict has inexorably widened and now consumes the region as Syria has been turned into a battlefield for proxy conflicts between regional players. Russia has been encouraged in its belligerence. The west looks helpless. Dictators the world over have been emboldened to believe that they can crush opposition using the most barbaric methods and the rest of the world will do nothing to stop them. Those striving for freedom have been commensurately disheartened. The rule of international law has been weakened.Action has consequences and they are not always the ones intended and hoped for. That was the grisly lesson of Iraq. Inaction also has consequences. Doing nothing can have a price every bit as high. I’d think better of the non-interventionists if they’d ever once admit that. Inaction has been a terrible choice in Syria.Interventionists have been rightly obliged to own all that went horribly wrong in Iraq. Non-interventionists, the horrors of Syria are on you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9151f5419482d5638c7f66eb6d4988c1c0dbec9b/0_80_5535_3322/master/5535.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5615b996547d67105cbf3e76dd76e0e5 1240w","title":"mary beard on my radar interview","story":"The Cambridge professor on Spanishnorth African food, her nerdish passion for exhibition catalogues and seeing David Gilmour in PompeiiBorn in Shropshire, classicist Mary Beard received her PhD from Cambridge University in 1982. She joined Newnham College as a fellow soon after, then the classics faculty’s only female lecturer. She has published 18 books, including The Parthenon (2002), The Roman Triumph (2007) and Women and Power (2017), and since 1992 has been classics editor of the Times Literary Supplement. She recently presented Civilisations on BBC2 a companion programme, Civilisations on Your Doorstep, airs on 4 May. Mary Beard is also currently presenting Front Row Late on BBC2 at 11.05pm on Friday nights until 11 May. I’m old enough to remember and, I confess, to slightly miss the era of “long lunches”. But when I get a chance to choose a place for a “semi-long” lunch, it would always be Moro, which does the best, most comforting Spanishnorth African food I know. I am a slightly picky carnivore, but this restaurant can wood-roast anything to perfection (with some great Spanish wines to match). We nostalgic types also take a wry pleasure sitting in the window and looking out at the now rather gentrified and foodie scene, and remembering what it was like all those years ago when Exmouth Market was a “real street”.Not far from where I live is Kettle’s Yard, the University of Cambridge’s wonderfully personal collection of modern art. Its nucleus was formed by the collector Jim Ede, and it’s still displayed in his house, where 50 years ago he’d entertain students keen to learn about contemporary art (not high on Cambridge’s academic syllabus at the time). It’s always been a great place for a lazy Sunday afternoon visit, and we’ve missed it over the last two years while it’s been closed for renovations. It’s just reopened with a new education wing, and new space, adjacent to Ede’s house, for temporary exhibitions – launching now with a great two-part show, featuring Cornelia Parker, Edmund de Waal, Caroline Walker and more. Worth the wait. This is one of those brilliant radio ideas that is set for as long a life expectancy as Desert Island Discs. Getting people back together years after they’d been involved in a major event, trauma, celebration or argument, and having them reminisce with a few prompts from Sue MacGregor, works almost every time. You can never tell whether they’re still going to be fighting the old battles, or will have mellowed into friendship, whatever they once felt. Greenham Common was a particularly good one (with tinges of warmth between old enemies) – and a whole new series is under way which will have me hooked.Manchester hasn’t been much on my radar until recently (coming from Shropshire, I always gravitated to Birmingham, before moving much further east). But over the last few weeks, I’ve been making an additional episode for the BBC Civilisations series, Civilisations on Your Doorstep, about the art you can see in the UK. We’ve seen some amazing things in regional museums, but if there’s been one standout city for sheer civic grandeur, it’s Manchester. The great Victorian town hall (currently being given a major makeover) has a sense of intelligent self-confidence to match most of what you’d find in Florence or Venice (including a clever series of paintings by Ford Madox Brown – celebrating, and partly inventing, the city’s history from the Romans to the Bridgewater Canal).I’m a complete sucker for exhibition catalogues, whether as a memory of those exhibitions I have seen, or as a substitute for those I haven’t. We have shelves of them at home, carefully if slightly nerdishly arranged in chronological order. But I usually have one in residence on my desk for a while, to offer a bit of pleasure between paragraphs of writing. The current occupant is the catalogue of Damien Hirst’s show in Venice last year, which I didn’t see – but even in book form it’s not just beautiful, it’s also a brilliantly clever riff on the whole idea of art objects dragged up from the sea bed (like so many of the most spectacular recent classical finds actually have been!).It’s probably no surprise that I don’t get to as many gigs as I once did. But a couple of years back, I did go to David Gilmour’s concert in the amphitheatre of Pompeii. It was close to heaven for a classicist who grew up as a Pink Floyd fan: to listen to Comfortably Numb on the seats where the posh people of Pompeii (yes, I was near the front) used to watch the gladiators and wild beasts was a combination of slightly unsettling and unbelievably thrilling. Happily, there’s a DVD for those who weren’t there – or for me, when I feel like recapturing the experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42e24f5e995eadee98adeb7aa50ec0ce822df33/35_340_6426_3858/master/6426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9ed8c154a9c82f3ac96e6ef49403e885 1240w","title":"farmers crops livestock turmoil beast from east climate change","story":"Last year, asparagus growers were harvesting as early as 8 April. This spring, they are not expecting to harvest their open-field crop until the last week of April – a week later than the official start of the season, St George’s Day, 23 April. Welcome to just one of the consequences of Britain’s disastrously delayed spring.“We have had a very challenging time,” said Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). “March breezed in with the ‘beast from the east’ and went out with the worst bank holiday on record.” For asparagus-lovers there is at least an upside. “The combination has to be right for the crowns to push through,” explained Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor. “The air temperature has to be at least 12C, while the soil temperature should be between 8C and 10C. With warmer weather expected, consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May,” he said.It is not just asparagus growers praying for a warm, dry spell. The earlier farmers can sow, the more chance their crops have to achieve their potential. “My father was a farmer and one of his sayings was ‘a peck of dust in March was worth a king’s ransom’,” Smith said. “If the ground is nice and friable and makes a good seed-bed then it can be potentially quite lucrative for the farmer. Well, that’s gone this year.”Farmers griping about the weather goes with the job. But Smith fears something is happening to Britain’s weather that has consequences which stretch far beyond farming.“We farm in north-east Essex, in the driest spot in the British Isles, and so we’re keen observers of the British weather. More often now we seem to be stuck in long periods of wet months and then long periods of dry months, which is more challenging for farmers.”Adam Lockwood grows spring onions in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. “At the minute we’re struggling to get going,” he said. “Potato growers haven’t even started planting yet and drilling dates are well behind where they should be.“We’re lucky in one sense that what we’re doing is all seed. I can buy seed and put it in a shed and it doesn’t matter, but lettuce and brassica growers who have plants raised in a nursery that were ready weeks ago, they’re now having to throw those away.”Like Smith, Lockwood thinks that the climate is changing. “We’re getting more rain in a shorter period rather than evenly distributed across the year – that’s what I’m noticing. And you’re getting more intense dry periods. It’s more extreme.”Livestock and dairy producers have been particularly hard hit. “It’s been a very late spring, even for a hill farm where we are,” said Richard Findlay, chair of the NFU’s livestock board, who farms in the North Yorkshire Moors National Park.“Instead of keeping the sheep in a couple of days after they’ve had lambs, we’re keeping them in for two or three weeks. We’re very fortunate in that we have the buildings to do it, but a lot of neighbours who don’t are struggling and have had many more losses.“We have nearly 1,000 sheep and it’s costing us about £1,000 extra a week at the moment to feed and house them to avoid a lot of losses. If we turned them out in poor weather there would be very little grass to eat.”What the farmers are experiencing first-hand accords with what scientists are finding. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, who helps run www.WeatherRescue.org – a site where volunteers digitise millions of historical weather observations – says that UK temperatures have risen by around 1.5 degrees in the last 150 years.“It’s basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture so, as the atmosphere warms, it means, when it does rain heavily, we get more rain than we would otherwise have done from the same storm 100 years ago.”In the short term, farmers like Smith hope that the coming week’s warmer, drier conditions are going to stretch through April. In the longer term, he believes that the first three months of 2018 should sound alarm bells.“We need to remember that it’s reckless to take food production for granted,” he said.Growers say their crops will not be ready until the end of the month, almost three weeks late.Many growers have yet to plant.Seeds which should have been sown back in February yet to go in.Stocks have been kept indoors for weeks, meaning higher fodder prices and possible price rises for consumers.Plants due to go into the fields have had to be thrown away.Spring barley and spring wheat weeks behind sowing schedule."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff605ed71710076bfcf8462774ae19d17e4986b2/0_0_3226_1936/master/3226.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4b6af9c9a451b748cc8e16d41e7cd49 6000w","title":"how to wear pastels in pictures","story":"Whether you are adding pastel pieces to an outfit or going for full-on monochrome, invest in soft colours this season"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4267691e2f8d6badfb18d7e8380bc11a023236a3/393_0_2130_1279/master/2130.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a79422a8942bd92dd5745e39deaf5f51 1240w","title":"2001 a space odyssey film haunts dream space","story":"Astronomers last week announced official names for the principal mountains and valleys of one of the solar system’s remotest objects, the tiny world of Charon. More than 3.6bn miles distant from the Sun, the moon – which orbits the dwarf planet, Pluto – was first observed closely in 2015 when the US probe New Horizons swept over its freezing, airless surface.Now the features revealed by the robot craft have been given titles by the International Astronomical Union. And key among the explorers and scientists honoured are the film director Stanley Kubrick and the writer Arthur C Clarke.As a result Kubrick Mons and Clarke Montes are now two of Charon’s major mountains. It is a fitting honour – and timely. The two men’s great collaborative work, the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, was released 50 years ago this month. By putting its creators’ names on the map of Charon, at the edge of the solar system, astronomers are repaying a debt to two visionaries who reshaped our thinking about the cosmos and created a film rated by some as the greatest ever made.Other celebrations of the film’s release include a recreation of the set of the film’s strange bedroom finale, which has just opened at Washington DC’s Air and Space Museum. In addition, the film-maker and writer Michael Benson’s book Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece, is published this week. Benson describes the movie “as an art film made with a Hollywood blockbuster budget that is more comparable to a musical composition than to the usual dialogue-based commercial cinema”.At the time, Kubrick had intended merely to make a science-fiction film that seemed credible. Clunky scripts, cardboard sets and crude cinematography marred most such films. So Kubrick turned to the British writer Clarke and the two worked on a script that slowly swelled in scope and ambition. Eventually they produced a story that covered the origins and destiny of the human species – a journey from ape to angel, as Kubrick put it.According to their story, simple cavemen would encounter intelligent aliens who would help them acquire brainpower and so set humanity on the path to the planets. Once space travel had been achieved, humanity would make further contact with these aliens, who would then help us – after we had survived the murderous attentions of a supercomputer – to turn ourselves into a species with superhuman powers.And this is what Kubrick eventually produced, although significant scenes were altered and dialogue written and rewritten throughout filming at MGM’s British studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Massive sets were constructed and props built and rejected. (The giant monoliths that appear in the film were clear Perspex initially, but were junked for the jet-black\u0026nbspvariety.)The end result is striking. No words are spoken during the film’s first 25 minutes, and of its total 142 minutes’ running time only 40 contain speech. Its finale is enigmatic to the point of inscrutability. Audiences were baffled and more than 200 people, about a sixth of the audience, walked out before the end of the film’s premiere, says Benson. MGM was convinced it had backed “an epic disaster”. Even Clarke was disappointed by the film’s lack of concession to audience understanding, he later recalled.Leading US film critics lined up to rubbish the movie: “trash masquerading as art,” claimed Pauline Kael in Harper’s. Fortunately for MGM, Kubrick and Clarke, this critical misfire was shortlived. The counterculture 1960s were then in full swing and young filmgoers were attracted by word of mouth (and ultimately the film poster’s tag line) suggesting that this was the “ultimate trip” movie. John Lennon even claimed at the time that he was going to see 2001 every week, while David Bowie produced his own musical tribute, Space Oddity, within a year. “Something was happening and older audiences did not necessarily know what it was,” says\u0026nbspBenson.Equally intrigued were young scientists desperate to witness technology that was credible and imaginative, something that had been entirely absent from feature films until then. “The film set new standards for ‘realistic’ portrayal of life in space, overcoming decades of Flash Gordon space-westerns,” says a former teenage astronomer, Professor Ian Christie of Birkbeck, University of London. “It also created a new soundtrack for cosmic spectacle – through the use of the opening of Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra and the music of Ligeti.”Similarly, astronomer Carl Murray, of Queen Mary, University of London, says the film was the first one that made him really think. He later became a member of the imaging team for the Cassini probe sent to Saturn in 2007. “We didn’t see any monoliths, but we all knew we owed a lot to Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick for inspiring our\u0026nbspimaginations.”In the end, 2001: A Space Odyssey became the highest-grossing film of 1968 – the only Kubrick picture ever to achieve such a standing. It also won Kubrick his only Oscar: for best visual effects (although they were actually the work of Douglas\u0026nbspTrumbull).The film also stimulated a generation of young cinema enthusiasts who have since dominated film-making. James Cameron, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan have all acknowledged 2001 as a key influence on their output. “Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science-fiction movie. It is going to be very hard for someone to come along and make a better movie, as far as I’m concerned,” says Lucas, creator of the Star Wars franchise.This view is maintained by the current generation of younger directors, such as Gareth Edwards, director of Rogue One, one of the more recent Star Wars films. “It is a movie blockbuster while also being as artistic and abstract as you can get. No one would bankroll a film like this again. It is a phenomenon of its time,” Edwards told the Observer.The film is not without its flaws, of course. In the early “Dawn of Man” sequences, Moonwatcher the apeman is inspired – by an alien monolith – to pick up a bone to use as a weapon, thus triggering an intellectual evolution that ends 4 million years later in modern humans and their propensity for war. The idea that violence underpins the human intellect is based on the ideas of anthropologist Raymond Dart, which were popularised in the 1960s by the writer Richard Ardrey, but which have since been discredited.“They don’t reflect current thinking,” says palaeontologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. “Bones may have been used as tools, but for digging for roots and insects – not as clubs. That said, 2001 is still one of my favourite films – dazzling and mystifying in equal measure.”There is another intriguing aspect about the timing of the film’s release. In 1968 humanity then seemed set for the stars. Only a few months after the film’s release, Apollo astronauts had reached the Moon and with a year had landed on it. The rest of the solar system would soon be conquered, it seemed. Space flight would become common. The film’s eponymous dateline therefore seemed prescient. However, the Vietnam war and other budgetary constraints ended that dream, though Clarke, who died in 2008, always remained\u0026nbspoptimistic about the prospects of further\u0026nbspexploration.In an interview at the end of the last century, he was asked what went wrong with his prediction. “Nothing very much, “ he replied. “America and Russia didn’t bother building more powerful, reusable launchers – they had other things on their minds – and that has made space too expensive for widespread use. Someone soon is going to get round that problem, however, and when that happens all the space stations and moonbases we envisaged will come about. I am very confident of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fd4a135a28124cce7d9679411cfb4910baefe4b/0_0_8688_5792/master/8688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=67fb15319a21c8e3da1e6c42d7f3c22d 1240w","title":"nuno espirito santo wolves manager a view of how football works","story":"The Portuguese manager, who has taken Wolves to the Premier League, explains his coaching philosophy and what he has learned in his previous jobsWhen you think about the Championship, when you are offered a job in the Championship, the first thought you must have is this: can I make my idea work in this league? This is the first step you must take. It is not about the Championship changing your idea. No. It is about your idea inside the Championship. Can we make it work? Is it possible to go there with our idea, our philosophy?We consider it, and we say yes. And then? We go for it. I am going to be honest with you. I was a goalkeeper, but through my career I spent almost as much time sitting on the bench as I did playing.This gave me two views, two perspectives. This allows you to see the game, to see space, to see everything. It helped me in the way I understand football now. My idea to be a coach came late, though. When you realise that the ball is faster than you, you say to yourself: “OK, I love the game. I want to go on in this game, but not as a player.”That is when I started to really think about the game. To learn from it. I spent two or three years in that process, of really trying to get inside football and look at my future. I learned a lot from the coaches I played for. At Porto, under José Mourinho, we won everything with a fantastic group of football players. Mourinho built that. He made us succeed, won everything. This has a big impact.Later on, back at Porto, you get a person like Jesualdo Ferreira. So many years in football, and a man who makes total sense in everything that he says. There are other things too. I played in Russia, in Spain, I was a part of the national team. You take everything you experience, and it is like you put it all in a box. Then, when you need anything from it, at any point, you go in and you grab it. It becomes an instinct.Ferreira gave me my first coaching experience, at Málaga and then Panathinaikos. He had a very good team of people working with him – one of them, Rui Pedro Silva, is now my assistant at Wolves – but this is when everything changes. You join a specific philosophy. A view of how football works. But you add to this view, and give these people your own view of the game, the view of being inside the dressing room. It is important to connect this feeling to the way you perform on the pitch.Dialogue. It is about sharing. One of the big things a group dynamic demands is to be able to listen and really understand, to learn from listening to others. You must always have space to share opinions, but at the same time be ready to make decisions that fit the way you think is better. This is when you recognise that you are ready to be a leader, to be the main figure of something. This is the feeling I had when I became a head coach for the first time.We were lucky. When I took the job at Rio Ave, I had never coached anywhere in Portugal. It’s not easy to be handed a club in the top league at that moment, but of course I had knowledge of Portuguese football and a good background of people who could help me. It was a real challenge, but we arrived with a strong idea that we were going to make this club grow. Really grow. No targets, but let’s see how far we can get.The first year, we finished sixth in the league. You say: “OK, for the second year, we’re gonna go for something big”. You make a bet with yourself. You make a bet, and you give everything to win it.The moment that I knew I was going to join Valencia was incredible. And I felt something different. At the Mestalla, where it wasn’t only 50,000 fans it was 50,000 noisy fans. In the Champions League, where every game is against a very, very good team. We’re talking league champions, massive teams, historic clubs. Everyone you fight against is someone as big as you, or even bigger.Then, Porto. Being a player for so many years at one club gives you something almost nobody has. You know the club. You feel the club. You know what it is to work and fight for this club. That is what made me feel OK, to know that we were ready. I want to win with this club, so I just have to be myself.We started, and the club had clear targets to achieve. We had to be in the Champions League that year, and we had a play-off against Roma. That was the major objective of the club, so day one of preparation was thinking only of that. After that, we could fight for every other game, for everything that we wanted to win, and look to our final objectives.A football club is not only about who is on the pitch. It needs a lot more to able to win, and win, and win over so many years. Everybody is necessary in these big moments, and at Porto the feeling from the fans was good. The Estadio do Dragao was always full, the people were always supporting the team, and that was important for everybody.I learned a massive amount from my time there. First of all, that a draw was not something that you considered as good. As a coach, that makes you grow. You have to win every game, and you work 24 hours a day towards that. Nothing else happens in your life. You cannot relax. You cannot. It is all about winning, and that pushes you, and makes you stronger. Really stronger.That doesn’t mean you react well to bad results. That is exactly the same feeling. It’s awful. And you hate it. That night, you don’t sleep. You just don’t sleep. But you have to be ready to go again the next morning, to go from that one step to the next.It is hard, but you perform better when you get the tools to help you disconnect. I am in that process. I’m able to disconnect sometimes, and just think about life. But last year, and the year before, was not like that. This comes with time. Like your idea, this comes with time.

He could not name a single jockey going to be at Royal Ascot or another European golfer apart from Colin Montgomerie competing in the US Open. He knew only one of the tennis players from that day’s semi-finals at Queen’s and when he was asked to name England’s cricket coach his reply was more in hope than expectation. “The Aussie?” he asked. Close. It was Duncan Fletcher, from Zimbabwe. “I did not intend to inflict complete and utter humiliation on the newly appointed minister for sport,” Balding said afterwards, “but it seems that he did that rather successfully for himself.”Headlines included: Is this The Most Stupid Sports Minister Ever? (Daily Mirror) and Are You Dumb Enough to be Sports Minister? (Daily Mail). Caborn consoled himself by keeping in his wallet a Mail article frothing with indignation about the appointment of a foreigner as England football manager, and another from the same newspaper trumpeting the rise of Sven-Goran Eriksson’s team. He was, however, honest enough to accept what was blindingly obvious. “I made an absolute bollocks of it.”Not just him, either. When Helen Grant took the same position in 2013, she was in trouble from the moment an interviewer from Meridian TV asked who had won the FA Cup that year. Grant did not seem to be aware of Wigan’s defeat of Manchester City. “Oh, come on – help – FA Cup holders?” She did, however, have a valiant stab at it. “Manchester United” was her answer. “Because it is my favourite club.”Grant could not name the women’s Wimbledon champion or the captain of England’s rugby union side. She didn’t have a clue which Paralympics athlete won the most golds at London 2012 and, if she wasn’t aware of Ben Watson’s last-minute winner for Wigan, she was never likely to know what year Maidstone dropped out of the Football League. Except, as the Conservative MP for Maidstone, she might have been expected to have a rough idea. “Last year?” she asked, taking whispered advice from one of her press aides and complaining of “these difficult questions”. Not quite. It was 1992.It is fair to say, therefore, that the bar has not been set tremendously high over the years and, if nothing else, at least Tracey Crouch has avoided falling into the same trap as some of her predecessors. Crouch is an FA-registered coach who has worked in grassroots football and describes herself as an avid supporter of Tottenham. I cannot recall too many faux pas during her three years in office and, until the last week, there wasn’t a great deal of evidence to suggest she had too much power and too little knowledge.All of which makes it curious, to say the least, that Crouch wants us to believe “there is no desire among the top clubs to change”. Really? Chelsea have also incorporated safe standing into their plans for the new Stamford Bridge. West Brom made the formal application that has just been knocked back. Brighton, Burnley, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Huddersfield, Swansea and Watford have all publicly backed safe standing. Stoke and Southampton are privately supportive. Bournemouth say they are open-minded. Newcastle have been to see how it works at Celtic, and Leicester, perhaps, are the only club whose position is not entirely clear. They say they are keeping a watching brief.That’s the Premier League dealt with. As for the Football League, it’s even more emphatic. The league was given a mandate by its 72 clubs as far back as 2013 to pursue safe standing and its stated policy is that supporters should be given a choice of whether to stand or have seated accommodation.Nothing can happen, however, until the government wises up and, plainly, that isn’t going to be straightforward when it involves cutting through a hotchpotch of stubbornness, ignorance and the now-familiar parliamentary disdain for football supporters that goes back to the Spitting Image years of Margaret Thatcher insisting on being called “Sir”, Kenneth Baker morphing into a slug, Douglas Hurd talking like one of the Daleks and Colin Moynihan going by the title of Miniature of Sport.Add in the fact West Brom’s application was submitted by the deputy chair of the FSOA and supported by the club’s safety advisory group – including representatives of West Midlands police, the fire and ambulance services and the Sports Ground Safety Authority – and that’s a lot of people whose combined knowledge, dare it be said, might just outweigh that of the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford.Perhaps it might make a difference when a delegation from Celtic speaks to the all-party parliamentary football group in a couple of weeks about the club’s positive experiences of safe standing. Then again, I’m not so sure I would put my faith in that group, either. When Roy Hodgson was invited to Westminster before the last World Cup, one MP suggested that if he wanted to bring through younger players the Football Association should impose an age limit of 25 or under for the national team (a suggestion that would have meant keeping only nine players from the previous squad).In the meantime, perhaps our sports minister might reflect, Sunday being the 29th anniversary of Hillsborough, that it was always a myth that standing caused that disaster. Maybe she would be decent enough to name a single club that is actively against the idea when, by my reckoning, it is possibly 92-0. Let us know how something that is acclaimed throughout the sport as a huge success in Glasgow can be illegal 120 miles south-east in Newcastle. And maybe stop to consider why so many people are starting to think that maybe it is you that is the problem now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e0970e6201be59a69bc3492d58f21803e0f554c/90_251_4391_2634/master/4391.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c73cb35487afde1c3061242fe0d9acbd 1240w","title":"wolves v birmingham championship live","story":"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Wolves’ promotion party at Molineux.

It was 1947. The Second World War had only recently ended. Nuytten’s dad had scored a job at Boeing, and the firm’s office in Vancouver Harbour was just a short walk away from the family home. Every now and then Nuytten would waltz down to the harbour unaccompanied, sneak out to the end of the docks, peer through the cracks and fall hopelessly in love with what he saw: fish, anemones, a teeming underworld. “I used to think: ‘Gosh, wouldn’t it be wonderful to go down there?’” he says. “To go down to that particular place?”Nuytten and I are sitting in his office, a wood-clad two-storey workshop on an industrial section of the North Vancouver shoreline not far from where he grew up. He is in his 70s now, scrupulously groomed and graciously quick-witted, with an old-time mariner’s flair for storytelling. He is also believed to be one of the world’s leading deep-ocean explorers. During a six-decade career he has pioneered ing techniques that are now industry standard, designed underwater machinery that has become a staple of several navies, and recorded world-first es.He has studied oil fields, surveyed dams, toured submarine construction sites and explored sunken wrecks. His firm, Nuytco Research, boasts a client list that includes the BBC, Greenpeace and film director James Cameron – Nuytten provided ideas and apparatus for The Abyss and Titanic and the pair remain friends. Nuytten also develops equipment for Nasa and, because the seabed is in some ways analogous to the surface of Mars, trains astronauts. Nuytten never went to college. He is almost entirely self-taught, yet the impact he’s had on ocean exploration has been vast.Now Nuytten is about to embark on a project likely to become his showpiece: a vast underwater colony, decades in development, that will provide humanity with an escape hatch should things go to pot above ground. Work will begin on a prototype later this year. A larger colony will follow soon after. So long as everything goes to plan, hundreds and then thousands of people will begin to migrate to the sea floor, to play out their lives at the bottom of the ocean in much the same way they would have done above ground. Before long, many more will follow.Whether or not everything will go to plan is difficult to judge. “It’s a harsh environment,” James McFarlane of International Submarine Engineering tells me. “You’ve got salt water, corrosion… And when you get into the water things start to get expensive fairly rapidly.” Still, Nuytten is determined. He has given his entire life to developing methods that allow humans to spend inhuman amounts of time underwater, often at unimaginable depths. Now he’s in the final throes of a mission to move us all down there – and once we’re there, he doesn’t think we’ll ever want to come back up. “I have this wonderful picture in my mind,” he says. “A little kid is sitting on his dad’s knee, just as I used to do, and he points to the ceiling of this habitat and says: ‘Dad, is it true people used to live up there?’”The idea the human race might one day live at the bottom of the ocean is not new – underwater habitats have been popping up in shallow waters since the early 1960s. In 1962 a French duo, Albert Falco and Claude Wesly, spent a week inside a minuscule habitat designed in part by the French explorer Jacques Cousteau. It sat 33ft below the surface on the sea floor close to Marseille and looked like a watery space station. The following year Cousteau convinced a five-person team to live for a month beneath the Red Sea, off the coast of Sudan. Two years later he developed a third base, Conshelf III, which he anchored more than 300ft below the surface off the coast near Nice. A six-person team lived there for three weeks. Every day they left the base to work on a mock-up oil rig. It was hoped inhabitants would perform similar work in the future, by which point the rig would be real.Before long, additional habitats materialised off the coasts of Bermuda, California and Germany. Bases were funded by governments, wealthy patrons or the petrochemical industry, and there was huge academic optimism. Here was an opportunity for scientists better to study the ocean’s inky depths, aquanauts to study human anatomy, energy companies to discover alternate resource streams and ers to launch record-breaking descents.“In the 60s everybody in the ocean business firmly believed there would be cities under the sea in fairly short order,” Nuytten says. “Never happened.”By the end of the decade the race to colonise the bottom of the ocean slowed to a trot, then all but petered out. The habitats were expensive to build and even more expensive to run. The lack of natural light could send tenants loopy. And, because the bases were built at ambient pressure, decompression periods were long and risky. Teams would spend weeks at a base, conduct tests, learn more about the limits of human endurance, slowly resurface to land and, in many cases, never return. One by one the habitats were abandoned. Research institutions erted funds elsewhere. Government agencies shifted their attention skyward. Space replaced the Earth’s oceans as our final frontier.At the time Nuytten was still a rookie in the ocean industry. He had begun to work on the concepts for which he would later be lauded, but Cousteau’s experiments, which to many seemed more like science fiction than reality, never strayed far from his mind. The subject became a kind of obsession. What if he could create a habitat that was cheaper to build and cheaper to run? What if he could find a way to reproduce the natural light man needs to exist comfortably? What if he could overcome problems caused by the deep ocean’s almighty pressure? And what if he could do what Cousteau and his contemporaries could not: convince society it would be a good idea to live 3,000ft under the sea?In his office, Nuytten tells me he works best when big questions like these loom overhead. “I run around looking for needs so I can fill them in. I like to have about 10 things on the go at once.” Nuytten is a perennial tinkerer, most effective when there are problems to solve, and the barriers to successful underwater living posed interesting problems.By the end of the 60s he had begun work on his own colony, which he began to refer to as Vent Base Alpha. Every now and then he’d scribble ideas on paper scraps and file them away, gradually accumulating hypotheses. Whenever he developed a new piece of technology, usually for a client, he’d experiment with how it might be incorporated within plans for the base. Sometimes a sketch would lead to a breakthrough, and he’d be able to understand what went wrong the first time someone tried to live under-water. What followed was half a century of successes and setbacks. Now a working vision has emerged.Here’s how Nuytten plans to build the colony. First, he’ll forage for equipment in what he calls “the boneyard”, a huge lot in which he stores discarded apparatus. (“I never throw anything away. I am a hoarder.”) He’ll locate a stack of abandoned saturation tanks and convert them into living quarters, laboratories, a series of floodable airlocks and a hangar for submersibles, each tank impeccably welded to the next. Later, he’ll equip the structure with a Stirling engine capable of producing the electricity required to create artificial sunlight, allow inhabitants to grow crops and, crucially, enable them to “crack water into hydrogen and oxygen”. Nuytten relays this last piece of information urgently. “There’s your life support,” he says.The colony will be transported to open water, most likely the Juan de Fuca Strait, a 154km-long outlet to the Pacific Ocean south of Vancouver Island. It will be submerged and hauled to the sea bed a few thousand feet below, and then it will be installed next to a hydrothermal vent – a kind of underwater geyser. The vent will give the colony its name, its hot emissions will power the Sterling engine and its mineral-rich deposits will be mined. Inhabitants will trade the bounty – laboratory-pure cobalt, in the case of the Juan de Fuca Strait – with buyers above the surface. Nuytten will make no financial gain from the project. Funding will come from government agencies, though Nuytten will forgo requesting official permission over whether or not a huge heap of metal can be attached to the ocean floor, preferring instead to “beg for forgiveness” after the installation – his customary strategy. (The prototype, in contrast, will be sanctioned by an offshoot of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, a government body, and anchored in the Burrard Inlet, not far from Nuytten’s office.)When the colony is complete, Nuytten will be among the first to take the plunge. His wife Mary, to whom he has been married for more than 60 years, will follow. As will his daughter, Virginia, if only for a visit. “I’m a mad-keen gardener,” she tells me over the phone. “If I couldn’t have my plants with me, I wouldn’t want to be there.” Soon enough, the family will be joined by other members of the ocean community: scientists, engineers, oceanographers, as well as James Cameron, who has already reserved a berth. Within a few weeks the base’s early tenants – a dozen or so people – will have settled into a routine.At least in the beginning, inhabitants will live underwater for months at a time, though they will be able to come and go. The atmosphere within the colony will tally with that on the surface, eradicating the requirement for decompression and making travel between the two worlds “like taking an elevator down to the parking garage”, explains Nuytten. But, soon enough, we will live at 3,000ft below as though it were normal. The colony will expand. More and more people will slip below the surface to begin second lives, and new colonies will appear around the world. Our routines won’t change, just the environments in which we perform them. We will do the things we normally do: commute to work, gossip with friends, spend inordinate amounts of time on social media. There will be underwater hospitals, banks, galleries, offices, parks, gyms, cinemas, farms, maybe even a forest or two. Children will be born in the colony. Eventually they will die there, too.But all of that will come down the line. First, Nuytten says: “We’ll have to figure out what we want to do down there.” He stops, then adds: “None of this has been done.”During our conversation Nuytten shows me an artist’s impression of the base. It’s an image of a structure that looks much like an underwater power station – a great mass of welded metal, similar to that of a rig. To the right of the picture a hydrothermal vent spouts sooty emissions and ers mine the ocean floor for minerals. Inside, inhabitants resembling Star Trek characters tend to operations. The surrounding environment looks dark and eery, a permanent night. You’d have a hard time working out what time of day the image depicts.I ask Nuytten why we would ever need to live underwater. “We need a second place to go,” he says. “There’s less and less space on Earth, and fewer and fewer resources. And here’s a whole ocean filled with them.” Nuytten is a fierce conservationist. “The oceans are the lungs of this planet. If they go, the planet goes.” In his grand vision, the colony is a kind of salvage operation. It will enable humanity to alleviate the burden it has placed on land. “We’ve demonstrated there will come a time when the planet as we know it will not be able to support the population. The population keeps growing and growing, and with climate change and natural disasters on land getting to be excessive… As far as we know, those same things aren’t happening under the sea. That’s one of the things we want to study: what are the effects of climate change on the deep ocean? We know what the effect is on the shallow regions, the coral reefs, but what about 3,000ft down? What’s happening there?”But how easy will it be to convince other people to take the plunge? “They’d batter the doors down,” he said. “Literally. I’ve given a lot of talks on this, and I’ve had all kinds of people, from wackos to really serious people, saying: ‘If you do this, we want to go.’”This seems like a hopeful response. Nuytten has spent much of his life below the surface. To him, the ocean is home. But what about the rest of us? What about the isolation? What about not being able to go anywhere any time we wanted? Won’t we miss the sun?Nuytten tells the story of an advertisement he’d heard had once been placed in a local UK newspaper. It read, “Wanted: people to go to Antarctica. Poor pay. No guarantee of success. Doing things no one has done before.” “They were inundated with applications,” Nuytten recalls. “I expect that to be the case with this. There are so many people, particularly young people, who are desperately trying to figure out what to do, what they can do that nobody else has done, things that are difficult, things that will protect our oceans.” The first inhabitants will be pioneers, Nuytten believes. “Once you have the first group down there, staying a few months, the next batch will show up.”Nuytten is in no doubt the colony will succeed. “There were an awful lot of people who said we’d never fly in the air,” he tells me. “And even more who said we’d never go to the moon.” But his comment is underpinned by a more urgent message, one that moved the conversation away from personal success and into the realms of societal requirement. “What are we going to do if something catastrophic happens to where we live?” he says, resignedly. “We have to have some place to go.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd94238265bfac9e6f50f754c84721875635699/0_714_8000_4802/master/8000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c20a0182154f7dccf5f6be62c9fe029f 1240w","title":"how to rewrite your own life story","story":"Jessica Huie turned her life around brilliantly. Now she’s helping other people – including her friend Meghan MarkleJessica Huie didn’t have the most promising start. She was expelled from school at 15 and pregnant two years later. Her father, a cab driver who had worked round the clock to give her opportunities, was devastated, as was her mum, a former model. But somehow she turned her life around to become a PR to A-listers – including an actor with whom she turned out to have a lot in common, Meghan Markle.And now, aged 37, Huie has written a book that overturns the PR notion that it’s what we project on the outside that matters. Instead, she argues, what we need to concentrate on is the interior search for fulfilment – finding our true purpose.A pivotal moment in Huie’s own search occurred when she was working in a hairdresser’s, after leaving school. “I was washing this woman’s hair and she said: ‘You’re too intelligent for this. Come and work for me.’ She said she worked in an office in Holland Park. It turned out she was a big-name PR with lots of famous clients.”Huie’s parents’ work ethic kicked in. As well as looking after Monet and studying, she did weekend shifts in a shoe shop. After A-levels she studied journalism and worked for Pride magazine, before embarking on six years at the coalface of PR, working for the then prominent, eventually disgraced, publicist Max Clifford.Huie began to see the shortcomings of her industry in the era of Jade Goody, the reality TV star who contracted and quickly died of cervical cancer. “When Jade became ill our role, which was to publicise our clients, continued – and as her condition worsened, her value as a story increased. And that didn’t sit easily with me. I wasn’t comfortable with it at all.”The crux of her book is this: in today’s celebrity-fixated, social media-obsessed world, we are constantly looking for external validation and direction while neglecting the essential part of ourselves that enables self-empowerment and our own happiness, which is our intuition and our inner judgement.“I began to realise that we’re living the wrong way round,” she explains. “We should be living inside out, and instead we’re living outside in. Intuition is the underused sixth sense which holds so much value for us. We should be letting it lead our lives – when we do, our lives start to flow.”By her late 20s, Huie had discovered that it’s possible to create something meaningful by following your instincts. Out one lunchtime looking for a card for Monet’s birthday, she suddenly realised that every single one on offer showed “blonde, blue-eyed princesses” who didn’t reflect the looks of her black, brown-eyed daughter. Back at the office, she decided to set up a company called Color Blind to produce ethnically erse cards. “I couldn’t have cared less about selling greetings cards, and the margins turned out to be pitiful,” she says. “But the mission to ensure all children had access to images on cards that reflected their own faces was one I felt I couldn’t walk away from. I wanted them to be able to validate their identities, with the subtle message that it’s wonderful and perfect to be exactly who you are.”In 2008 she left Clifford and founded her own PR company with the aim of working not with celebrities but female entrepreneurs and attempting realistic, rather than aspirational, strategies to boost their businesses. Which was how, in 2015, she found herself working for Markle, who came to her for help to raise her UK profile.The first time they talked was on Skype. They bonded easily, remembers Huie. They are just a year apart in age and both daughters of mixed-race parents. “I liked her. We connected and we got talking about race. I found her impressive: she was quick-witted and honest.” Huie had the idea of sending Markle off to Malta where she researched the life of her great-great-grandmother who was raised there, and wrote a magazine piece about it. “That was courageous,” says Huie. “It tackled issues around ethnicity and heritage and belonging, and they’re topics not everyone would be brave enough to go into.”Running her own company gave Huie freedom, but there still lurked in her mind some bigger questions about the nature of PR, especially in the digital age. Gradually she began to put her philosophy into action in her own life. Looking back, she could see that conceiving Monet at 17 had been part of her own quest for purpose, and it had worked. Having raised Monet alone in the early years, supported by her parents, she embarked on a new relationship and six years ago had another child. Deep down, though, she knew the relationship wasn’t right and, although the last thing she wanted to be was a single mother a second time around, she ended the relationship when her baby was just a few months old.“It was terrifying to find myself alone, again, with a tiny baby and an older child. I was hoping for domestic bliss and normality. But breaking up was absolutely the right decision, because it allowed me to find myself.”To do that is not easy. “I feel as though I’m in a forest, and I’m hacking through my stuff. A lot of it is cleared now, but it’s never entirely gone. You have to be prepared to keep on hacking. Our most pressing duty is to reconnect with ourselves, because then we can connect with others. We need time, without distractions, to mine deep within ourselves. Once we do get to know ourselves, change can happen.”She’s now been in a new relationship for the last five years, and married for the last two. The final layer of understanding what her own purpose was, and the spur to write her book, came in 2016 when she was caring for her father, who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.“I’d spent my life trying to control what happened to me. But this was something I couldn’t control. I had to surrender. That taught me an important lesson, which is that it’s not by seeking to control the world that we get the best out of it. So, in the final moments of my dad’s life, I realised the true purpose of my own.”Rewrite your story. Chances are you’re used to telling it a certain way and the negatives may be to the fore. But if you take time to unpick it, you can reshape it.Stop pretending! It’s exhausting – and also your truth speaks to the truth of others. Authenticity is the ticket to success – the key to fulfilment.The person you present to the world needs to be congruent with the inidual you are when you shut up shop. If you stand for something, infuse it into every part of your life. Stop compartmentalising.Fear is always what stops us from doing the things we need to. So often we make our pain and unhappiness into a security blanket, as though living a life that’s limited will protect us from exposure.True liberation in life is a state of completeness that comes with releasing the craving to be significant in the eyes of others. You are the only audience that matters. Live your life deliberately and courageously: you don’t need anyone else’s permission!

The jinking flight of an orange-tip butterfly? Or the first swift screaming in the sky? There are many ways we can join this joyous explosion of life among the species witth which we share the world.Spring may be late, but bluebells are unfurling across the nation. Wildlife charities provide plenty of ideas about where they can be spotted: National Trust suggestions include Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire and Winkworth Arboretum, Surrey Woodland Trust recommendations include Crinan Wood, Argyll and Bute, and Coed Aber Artro, Llanbedr, Harlech while the Wildlife Trusts have 100 hotspots from the splendidly named Twentywellsick Wood in Yorkshire to Sydenham Hill Wood in south London. My favourites include Finemere Wood, Buckinghamshire, Lady’s Wood, Cambridgeshire and Foxley Wood, Norfolk.Spring butterflies are on the wing again, and late April to early May is the perfect time to spot two of our rarest species. The Duke of Burgundy flies on downland in the Cotswolds and Hampshire, such as Rodborough Common and Noar Hill, while the pearl-bordered fritillary enjoys sunny woodland rides in western Scotland and south-west England – ukbutterflies.co.uk has great location information.You can hear glorious birdsong wherever you live. Your local Wildlife Trust will organise dawn-chorus walks, but you can do your own: rising at 5am is painful but you never regret an early morning orchestra of blackbirds and blackcaps.Don’t overlook the joys of dusk either. April is ideal for watching badgers before vegetation obscures their setts: position yourself downwind of a sett an hour before sunset, scatter a few peanuts, and wait quietly. You’ll see owls and bats, too. BCN Wildlife Trust organises bat punt safaris on the River Cam in Cambridge: 90-minute trips every Friday from 11 May. Warwickshire Wildlife Trust has a bat walk at Brandon Marsh on 10 May the Royal Parks and the Bat Conservation Trust have details of more bat walks.With shorts and T-shirt weather on the way, it’s time to blow away the winter cobwebs on a coastal walk. Options? Chalkup21 is a new 17-mile architecture trail along the top of the white cliffs between Folkestone and Deal, Kent, which highlights contemporary buildings en route, such as the Battle of Britain Memorial building at Capel-le-Ferne and the timber and glass cafe at the end of Deal pier.If the change in temperature puts you in the festival mood, what could be more spring-like than one that celebrates cherry blossom? In Japan the arrival of the flowers is greeted with almost religious fervour. One of the best displays in the UK can be found at Brogdale farm in Kent. The home of the national fruit collection will be offering Hanami picnics until the end of April (booking essential) and a Japanese-inspired festival on 21 April with cultural demonstrations and food .For a more formal floral display, the Harrogate spring flower show is one of the first big events in the gardening calendar – at the Great Yorkshire Showground from 26-29 April, with show gardens, floral displays and talks and demonstrations.In Scotland the Celtic May Day festival of Beltane is celebrated with bonfires, torchlit processions, drumming and the arrival of the May queen on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, on 30 April. And in Wales you can witness the end of the lambing season at the RSPB Lake Vyrnwy organic farm in Powys. Tours of the lambing sheds will be available at weekends until the end of April (but booking is essential).For a magical experience, why not try one of the singing with nightingales events in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Kent throughout April and May? Organised by singer Sam Lee of the Nest Collective, these are intimate woodland concerts held around a camp fire. If you’re lucky, the musicians will be accompanied by the sound of nightingales singing, and you will be able to celebrate this very African bird that takes its summers in EnglandI almost hesitate to say the frost has gone (I was mugged in March after I’d sown early salad seed), but it is probably safe to say that you can start spring gardening now. So go to your local garden centre. Stock up on fresh compost and seaweed feed and a few early summer flowers. Open your shed or seed drawer sharpen your tools. It’s been purgatory this year, frogspawn frozen, broad beans blackened by frost. But gardens are forgiving almost everything can be fixed in an afternoon.First, have a look at the flower seed sites. Roger Parsons for scented sweet peas, Higgledy Garden for colourful annuals (calendula, cornflowers and cosmos), Sarah Raven for something posh. Scatter grass seed in places where yours has worn thin.If you have room for vegetables, I rate Brown Envelope Seeds for organic and unusual varieties (why grow the same salads that are cheap and available in every supermarket?). Franchi are good for anything Italian such as basil, chards, chicories, courgettes and borlotti beans. Tamar also has a good range. The old gardener’s rule says that soil is warm enough to germinate if it’s comfortable to sit on in thin shorts. I just tend to see if the weeds are growing well.You will need to dig, or at least to hoe. Turn in compost if you can: well-rotted manure is best of all (cow for vegetables, horse for flowers, if you can find it).I know it is supposed to be warm this week but I would caution against sowing most flowers outdoors till May. That said, I’ve scattered nasturtiums and calendula. Start annual seeds off in trays and pots on a windowsill. Same with tomatoes. If you have room, sow a few rows of radishes, rocket and lettuce. If you haven’t, stock a kitchen window box with rosemary, thyme, chives and oregano.Remember to find yourself a spot in the sun to sit and talk, have a cup of tea, a beer or a glass of wine. Gardening isn’t just about flowers and food, it’s also therapy and fun.To order a copy of Morning by Allan Jenkins (4th Estate, £12.99) for £11.04, go to guardianbookshop.com Spring is a reminder that you have legs so, for women, tights are a stone-cold no. Elsewhere, the only acceptable hat is a beret (think Dior, buy Topshop) and while you should slough off your coat, do keep a light jacket, ideally a trench, worn open (Céline), in checks (Burberry) or in lilac (Dries Van Noten). Men, try a short jacket as seen at Sandro but available at Cos, or a brightly coloured raincoat – anything from Vetements to Patagonia is fine.Spring 2018 is also about the nuance of colour. Muted ice cream shades such as lemon sorbet and strawberry are in abundance everywhere, from Victoria Beckham to Cos on both men and women, although neons are also appearing on the high street (particularly on T-shirts at Topshop and \u0026amp Other Stories). Men should try the trend via a brightly printed shirt – Aloha versions were at Balenciaga and Ami, but really any foliage will do.Spring suits for women are a good weatherproof addition. Matching, of course, in light pink or stripes. And frankly, on men too. Take inspiration (honestly) from Harry Styles’s Gucci and Palomo Spain tour outfits.When it comes to shoes, women wear them with a low heel (spiky like Balenciaga or square like Topshop), and men can do anything (a loafer, a chunky boot or a trainer works). Definitely wear socks.In other trend news, streetwear continues to dominate the catwalk at Fendi and Burberry and everything in between. If a full Adidas tracksuit feels a bit much, start sensibly with footwear.Veja trainers are becoming the updated answer to Stan Smiths for women, but equally the much-derided ugly trainer – from Balenciaga’s Triple S to Fila’s chunky platform trainer – is all over the shops. Ideal if the weather turns damp again, which is highly likely.At the National Gallery in London Monet and Architecture offers a new perspective on the impressionist master’s work, looking at his career through the buildings he painted, while America’s Cool Modernism: O’Keeffe to Hopper, with 35 paintings never before seen in the UK, runs at Oxford’s Ashmolean until 22 July.In May the Barbican will partner with the Museum of London for London Nights, a major photography exhibition and film season celebrating the capital city after dark. The British Film Institute, meanwhile, marks the 30th anniversary of the anime classic Akira.On stage, Alfred Molina discovers his artistic side in John Logan’s Red (Wyndham’s Theatre from 4 May) Ben Chaplin stars in Joe Penhall’s Mood Music (the Old Vic from 21 April) Maxine Peake tackles Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days at Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre (from 25 May) and Michelle Terry takes on the role of Hamlet in her first production since becoming artistic director of the Globe (from 25 April).The movie blockbuster season will see Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars Story in cinemas this month. Those looking for a more understated experience should try Beast, Michael Pearce’s atmospheric crime debut, set in Jersey Claire Denis’s sophisticated delight Let the Sunshine In and Lean on Pete, Andrew Haigh’s stirring take on “one boy and his horse” tales.Spring’s TV highlights include the return of The Handmaid’s Tale (Channel 4, May) the final season of The Bridge (BBC2, May) and Abi Morgan’s glossy tale of warring orce lawyers, The Split (BBC1, 24 April). Netflix airs Bobby Kennedy For President, its in-depth look at the candidate’s life and death, on 27 April, while Edward St Aubyn fans hold their breath as Patrick Melrose, Sky Atlantic’s take on his books, arrives on 13 May.In the world of fiction, Jack Grimwood’s taut Nightfall Berlin is spring’s best thriller Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City offers an unputdownable look at London today, while Lissa Evans’s wise and witty Old Baggage asks what happens once you’ve tried to change the world. In non-fiction, Behold, America sees Sarah Churchwell turn her fierce gaze on the America First movement. Michelle Dean’s Sharp is an elegant dissection of literary lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a564ebad6d99197224635b58c9eee27e496c6792/0_276_5125_3075/master/5125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8df8e69cb897a257ae65f95f962905ca 1240w","title":"my new partner and i have very different sleeping habits mariella frostrup","story":"As we get older, compatibility is about more than good sex and emotional support. But turn to some insomnia cures before you give upThe dilemma I have a new partner after my wife died three years ago. We are very compatible and happy together, emotionally and sexually, but the one distressing issue is our different sleeping requirements. I need a good, solid, uninterrupted nine hours and an early night, otherwise I get extremely irritable. She is more of a night owl, often waking in the night to use her iPad or even make a cup of tea. She has an amazing ability to catnap and fall asleep seemingly instantly, whereas I need a long period of peace and quiet before dropping off. I am also a light sleeper and her snoring is a problem for me. Earplugs don’t work. I accept that I’m a prodigious snorer myself, but that doesn’t seem to bother her so much. Do I carry  on retreating to the spare room, or is there another solution as I’d rather we stay together? We don’t live together (yet), but after a few days spent with each other,  I need a couple of days alone to catch up on my sleep!Mariella replies And you say you’re compatible? There’s more to a relationship than good sex and emotional back-up. When we mature, compatibility is about more intimate and intricate stuff than simply rubbing along during daylight hours. It’s all very well coexisting when you’re wide awake and rational, but what about when you’re barely conscious, immensely vulnerable and aching for a good night’s kip? That’s when coupledom is properly put to the test, and I should know.You readers share such intimate stories with me that’s it’s only fair I should reciprocate occasionally. My husband loves to shame me with the tale, much exaggerated naturally, of when I kicked him in the middle of the night. Desperate for sleep as I was, and driven to the edge of sanity by his snoring, reason was replaced by irrepressible rage. I kicked him hard on the shin in the hope that, like hiccups, the shock would curtail the nasal crescendos filling the room. He leapt up, outraged, expressed his displeasure in no uncertain terms and then fell straight back to sleep, snores soaring to even greater discordant heights, while I lay wide awake and fuming beside him.It’s a shameful confession which shows that what happens at night is not insignificant. In serious cases it can be sanity-depleting and life-threatening, so I’m grateful to you for raising this pernicious problem. Our inability to enjoy the restful sleep we’ve taken for granted for decades is one of the most frustrating things about ageing. If I’m asked what I miss about youth, the answer is all too easy: the blessed unconsciousness you sink into when you finally make it to bed. It’s all I can do to refrain from sobbing in envy when my daughter staggers into the kitchen at midday rubbing her bleary eyes, having been out for the count for 14 hours. Indeed, I’d sacrifice every one of my twentysomething dawn chorus debauches for the ability to take a full night’s sleep for granted now.When I look in my bedside drawer, it’s hard not to be devastated by the obvious indications of decline. First and foremost are the melatonin pills that I happily discovered recently are available on the NHS to the over-55s. It’s certainly confirmation of the epidemic of sleeplessness among my contemporaries. Magnesium spray reduces the aches and pains, particularly for those restless-leg sufferers such as myself. Then there’s an eye mask, silicone earplugs (unlike foam, they do work), headphones in case I need to listen to whales singing or a talking book and a torch so I can read without disturbing my aforementioned happily snoring husband.Every day a new scientific study confirms that the key to health, happiness and longevity is a good night’s sleep. You’re faced with a challenging conundrum and I’m not convinced companionship into your twilight years is going to be worth the cost. Then again, the alternative is equally bleak. Remaining single for long periods seems to create a marked decrease in what you’ll put up with from the rest of your species, so surviving your new partner’s opposing sleep pattern is a timely test of your ability for tolerance.Happily, we are an ingenious species and having focused a lot of our efforts on the battle against insomnia, there are numerous approaches and cures now available to test. I’d recommend that you turn to all or some of the products I listed from my own bedside stash and particularly silicone earplugs for yourself and melatonin for your catnapping girlfriend. As an impetuous youngster, I used to think that sleeping entwined was the ultimate affirmation of romance. Nowadays, the increasing appeal of my own bedroom (and bathroom) is the greatest threat to my romantic status. If you can afford to have a spare bedroom, I’d highly recommend hanging on to it as a last-ditch solution. Meanwhile, stock up on all the many little items that will make your cohabiting life run smoother and embrace the necessity of compromise, without which we’d certainly never pair up at all.

Her cynical, defiantly un-sunny pop anthem New Rules was an improbable song-of-the-summer last July. Streamed online more than 1bn times since, it has helped establish this 22-year-old Londoner as pop’s beach-storming new conquistador – a winner of two Brit awards in February, and the first female artist to be nominated for five. Lipa has an unusual name and history (she comes from a family of Kosovan academics, parted in the 1990s by war), a room-stilling presence (she stands 6ft-plus in heels), and a talent for hanging together pop-music contradictions, specialising in floor-filling bangers that are somehow both jaded and buoyant, universal and intimate. She’s interesting in a number of ways, all of which I want to explore when I meet her one morning in London, towards the end of her Observer cover shoot. Before anything else, though, we discuss her hands.Specifically Lipa’s palms, which are as tough and as work-worn as a lumberjack’s. It’s as if Lipa has spent the week up to now baking bricks, or fighting in a cage. Laughing about it, sighing, Lipa passes her hands around so that everyone in the studio can have a feel. She blames her personal trainer. “We lift a lot of weights,” she says. “We box.” And the crowds on her recent world tour, Lipa points out, wouldn’t just rouse themselves. “I feel like I’ve spent about a year clapping these hands together and shouting: ‘Come on!’”Lipa is bright, good fun, not easily cowed. She asks to feel my palms and after briefly investigating these pearly idler’s mitts she plants on me a brilliantly sceptical stare, as if to ask: have you ever done a hard day’s work? She’s proud of her work ethic. Last week she was gigging in Australia, where some nights, to the squealy delight of her fans, she not only sang but manned the arena merch stands. “It’s a 24-hour job,” she tells me. “And at this point I want to be able to say yes to everything. Every tour, every show, every shoot, every whatever.”We’re in a warehouse in east London, one of those vast places that’s been whitewashed and stud-walled to make it into a multipurpose space, part studio, part gallery. Now that the glowering and vogueing of the photoshoot is over, Lipa puts on patterned jeans and a loose cream jumper, inside the collar of which she tucks a fistful of her dark shoulder-length hair. She needs a tea and a sit, so together we set off through the warehouse corridors to find somewhere. There’s a small glass-walled room abutting the gallery, and as both are deserted it seems a sensible place to put ourselves. Then midday rolls by, and people wander in off the street to admire the art. Some glance through at Lipa, out of reach and out of earshot beyond a wall of glass.It strikes Lipa as she sips her tea that this all amounts to a pretty good analogy for a pop career. Sitting – exposed, apart and a touch ridiculous – in a giant transparent\u0026nbspbox.“You want to be as honest as possible in the music you make,” she says, thinking not so much of her smash single New Rules, which Lipa did not write herself, as of songs such as Blow Your Mind (Mwah) and IDGAF, Lipa’s blunt, sweary postscripts on unhappy love affairs. She continues: “But then there’s the other side of it, when you do want a bit of a personal life, and you get upset that you’ve opened yourself up so much.” She shrugs inside the cream jumper, which unlooses some of her hair. “I guess it comes with the territory – a figuring-out of the right balance, how to be really content, y’know, in this see-through box I’m now living in.”As I said before, she isn’t easily cowed. Earlier this year Lipa read a comment by one of her fans online and took a moment to respond to it. This was as ephemeral as any social media moment, a come-and-go thing that in the end amounted to a few dozen characters on Twitter. But when I read about the incident (which the tabloids wrote up as a minor scandal) I was intrigued, because it seemed a rare example of a pop star breaking character – to remind the public just how silly and how unreal this whole pop game is. Lipa had just separated from her boyfriend, Paul Klein, of the US rock band LANY and now there was gossipy speculation she was back in touch with an ex, a chef called Isaac Carew. One fan thought of the lyrics to Lipa’s New Rules, in which the dos and don’ts of a break-up were carefully itemised (“One, don’t pick up the phone…”).“Sis,” this fan tweeted at Lipa. “You broke the new rules.”“Sis,” Lipa wrote back a minute later. It was the middle of the night. “Get a grip.”Pop should be taken lightly, Lipa believes. “It has to be fun. You’ve got to enjoy it. You can’t get upset about every little thing.” Music after all is the escape – the real world has plenty of methods for upsetting us\u0026nbspalready.And so we discuss geopolitics, and Lipa’s family history. She comes from a large family of ethnic Albanians, to whom “so much has happened”, she says, “in my grandparents’ lives, and my parents’ lives… When you try to come to it and grasp everything there, it’s a lot.” She does her best to boil down their complicated story.Her mother, Anesa, was born to a Kosovan father and a Bosnian mother. In the 90s, war came first to Bosnia, where Anesa’s mother lived, and then to Kosovo, where by now Anesa was living with her fiance, Dukagjin Lipa. Dukagjin was the son of a well-known historian, Seit Lipa, who at that time was the head of the Kosovo Institute of History. When conflict began to brew in Kosovo, Seit’s career abruptly ended. As Lipa tells it: “Once the Serbians came in, they wanted a lot of the historians to rewrite the history of Kosovo. To change it – that Kosovo was always part of Serbia and never part of Yugoslavia. And my grandfather was one of those people who wouldn’t, so he lost his job, because he didn’t want to write a history that he didn’t believe to be true.”In 1992, Dukagjin and Anesa sought refuge in London, while their parents stayed behind in Kosovo and Bosnia. Seit Lipa died in 1999, the year that the Kosovo war ended. “He had a heart attack. And because the borders were closed, my father couldn’t go back to see him.”Lipa was born in north-west London in 1995. “I’ve seen my parents work every day of my life,” she says. In Kosovo her father was training to be a dentist, her mother to be a lawyer. Sudden flight to London threw all this over, and for a long time Lipa’s parents worked as waiters in cafes and bars. In the evenings, her father took business courses. Her mother retrained in travel and tourism. “While I was going to school they were going to\u0026nbspschool.”Flight and sanctuary form the backbone of her family story, and I ask Lipa what she has made of recent political flailings – specifically President Trump’s crowing about his border wall, and before that the extremist Brexiters with their scare-stories about refugees. Lipa says that coming from a background such as hers, “you understand something on a personal level. That no refugee leaves their country without having to.” As for Brexit itself, “I see how important it is for Kosovo, for Kosovans, to be a part of the EU, what it means for them to be a part of something like that. So it’s heartbreaking.” On Trump she takes the long view – very much the historian’s granddaughter. “Later down the line I think we’ll be able to see very clearly, when we put someone like Trump in power, what went wrong. And the hope is we’ll learn from it.”We talk about that amazing name – her grandmother’s suggestion, she says, as dua is the Albanian word for love. “Now I’m proud of it. Now I am. But when I was growing up all I wanted was to be called Hannah, Sarah, Ella… anything normal. Because with Dua you had to explain: I’m from Kosovo.” And this in turn made a lot of people adopt a particular expression – intrigued, sad. It was well-meant sympathy, but brutal war isn’t the first thing any kid wants other people to think about when they’re saying hello.Lipa sometimes uploads old family photos to her Instagram, and not a few of them show her parents when they first arrived in London. Yikes! There’s a wedding photo that shows Anesa wearing a headdress of flowers and Dukagjin, who in Kosovo had played in a guitar band, with long rock-star hair. This pair absolutely smouldered. Lipa recalls: “Boys at school would say: ‘Your mum’s really hot.’ And the girls would say: ‘Your dad’s so fit.’ Now I find it funny, but as a kid you didn’t want to be different. It made me blush.”From the available evidence on social media, her parents continue to smoulder. They are great senders of heart emojis, patently still besotted with each other. To be the child of a Really Good Couple, I start to say to Lipa… That can have its own difficulties. Especially if it puts a fixed idea in your head of what love should look\u0026nbsplike.Lipa was 11 when her parents sat her down at the kitchen table with big news. Dukagjin had graduated from his studies and been offered a job in the Kosovan capital, Pristina. Lipa was at the end of primary school. “My best friends were all going to different schools. And I told them, ‘Um, I’m going to Kosovo.’”How did you feel?“I was excited. We always spoke Albanian at home. I had my cousins in Kosovo that I’d never met.”And when you got there?“It was absolutely mortifying. Going into a classroom… I remember my first science lesson. They were so far ahead, in terms of mathematics and science. I got such bad grades, especially in the first six months. I could speak the language, but I couldn’t read or write in it.”There was a lot she loved about Pristina. Living there helped Lipa understand she wasn’t just a Londoner, as she’d always thought – that instead she “came from two places”. In musical terms, it was in Pristina that she first got into American hip-hop. Snoop Dogg and Method Man toured through, and these were Lipa’s first gigs. The experience planted in her a love for rap that sat alongside her established obsession with bright, brash pop: Pink, Nelly Furtado, Katy Perry. Lipa knew she could sing. Sometimes, in private, she tried mashing together the two influences, putting a deep, drawled, sung-rap spin on her bedroom renditions of Christina Aguilera. She hoped for some formal training and when Lipa was about 14 she sat down with her parents for another kitchen-table conference.Me, says Lipa. “I didn’t think I’d be able to do this on a global scale, living in Kosovo.”You weren’t telling yourself that at 14…OK. But you weren’t telling your parents that at 14…Lipa smiles: yes and no. She came up with “a trick”, she says, selling her parents on the idea that her main goal was to go to a good, British university. “I said: ‘To do that I’ll need to do my GCSEs and A-levels in English.’” It worked, and they agreed. Back in London, Lipa was looked after by friends of her parents. She did enrol at Sylvia Young on weekends, and began recording demos that she uploaded to YouTube and SoundCloud.As well as trying to be noticed as a musician, Lipa started a fashion blog. Sweetly titled – “Dua Daily” – this started as a sixth-former’s hobby and was maintained pretty thoroughly for two or three years at the end of her teens. Parts still exist online (Lipa’s voice squeaks when I mention it: “Is it online somewhere? That’s so funny”) and as a document it’s intriguing, charting a young woman’s evolution from wide-eyed kid to a professional London scenester, musing on “how important networking is”. We see her try some modelling, try some acting (at one point in an X Factor ad). For the most part she was forthcoming during this period. Networking, and networking some more, always pushing on anybody in music the links to her demos.Eventually Ben Mawson, Lana Del Rey’s manager, had a listen. He signed Lipa, and started arranging long, immersive studio sessions with different collaborators. (The blog: “I am now currently on a gap year and plan to focus full time on my extra curricular activities. And by that I mean music!”) Client and manager were waiting to hear something that excited them. And the best stuff, tonally, seemed to happen when Lipa’s two preferred genres – moody rap and catchy bubblegum – came crunching together. New Rules was actually written for and rejected by a number of other artists, including the girl band Little Mix. When Lipa tried the track she infused it with something new, a battle-weary languor that made it a timely anthem of millennial ennui. One and a half billion clicks later New Rules remains her calling card, her name-maker. At the Brits in February her performance of the song was the evening’s highlight.She had been nominated in five categories on the night. New Rules was up for best single, and her million-selling debut album, Dua Lipa, was up for best album. In the end she won twice, as best female solo artist and British breakthrough act, which meant two trips to stage\u0026nbspand two very different\u0026nbspspeeches.The first was political. “Here’s to more women on these stages,” Lipa said, “more women winning awards, and more women taking over the world.” Thinking back on this, Lipa tells me it hadn’t gone unnoticed by her that she was the only woman nominated in a number of those other, nominally multi-gender categories… “I felt it was really important to touch on the fact that I’ve always been inspired by women and they were the reason I was stood on that\u0026nbspstage.”Her second speech of the night was softer, wispier – a “chase your dreamsmagic is real” bromide that I now find hard to square with the punchy realist I’ve been taking to all morning. Lipa, not so long ago, was able to step out of the pop bubble and tell a fan: get a grip. Can she really believe in all that dream-chasey, magic-can-happen stuff?Lipa listens to this and says sure. But what she learned from her family’s experience was that you keep going, you keep working, you try to better your chances of better luck. “A big part of who I am,” she says, “has been watching my parents learn to adapt in different places, in different circumstances… And my dad would always tell me: ‘You have to work really, really hard, just to have a tiny bit of luck.’ So to answer your question, I do believe in the romantic side of it. And I believe in the hard graft, too.”She opens her hands: the lumberjack palms.“For me, growing up, doing music, watching pop stars on TV – that felt as crazy as cartoons. Totally unbelievable. Not real. What I’ve learned from my parents is this: everything comes from hard work. And then, maybe, things align.”Dua Lipa is on tour now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/390c7b1a691c50490f975dcc0a42feff6d06f310/0_0_3608_2164/master/3608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=787af488231dd2f257d77c469b588905 1240w","title":"mark knopfler skips dire straits rock hall of fame induction","story":"British rockers Dire Straits have been inducted into the rock’n’roll hall of fame, but the occasion was marked without its lead singer and guitarist Mark Knopfler, who chose not to turn up to the ceremony.Knopfler skipped the concert in Cleveland, US, on Saturday, and it was left to bassist John Illsley to explain his absence.“I’ll assure you it’s a personal thing,” Illsley said onstage. “Let’s just leave it at that.”In an earlier interview with Billboard, Illsey said of Knopfler: “He just didn’t feel like coming, it’s as simple as that. It just didn’t appeal to him, and I appealed to him on several occasions.”On Saturday, Illsley acknowledged the awkwardness of Knopfler not being present and then took a subtle swipe at his close friend by saying, “it’s more than one person, a collective”. The band did not perform after speaking.Illsley did compliment Knopfler for writing music that made the band – who had a string of hits in 1970s and 80s, including Sultans Of Swing and Money For Nothing – “stand out from the crowd”.Former Bon Jovi members Richie Sambora and Alec John Such joined current members, including Jon Bon Jovi, onstage to mark the band’s induction into the prestigious club. They performed crowd favourites Livin’ on a Prayer, You Give Love a Bad Name and It’s My Life.The 33rd annual Rock Hall ceremony kicked off with a tribute to Tom Petty, who died in October at age 66.

The notices – requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period – were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica’s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.Banks – who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing £8.4m in donations and loans – confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received “information notices”. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were “responding to it’” He said the ICO’s action was not an “investigation” but “an information request”.In a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for £41,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for “analysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development”, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum.Banks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after “new information had come to light”. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica.Banks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it “did some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.”Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU’s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around £40,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news.He also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month.Ukip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica “saw” the data but a spokesman admitted the information – including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things – was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as “preparatory work”.The spokesman said: “I asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn’t like it and he’d refused to pay for it. It’s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.”The revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to iniduals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of £42,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU’s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission’s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense.The unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner’s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU’s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO’s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain’s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was “ridiculous” that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica’s computer servers and equipment.Separately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work. A spokesman said: “Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data. And Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica whether in relation to the EU referendum or otherwise.”The ICO may be asking questions because of previous comments Banks has made, including in an interview a year ago with the Observer. When asked about the use of Leave.EU’s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?”In an email on Friday he said: “Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.” He added: “Make any mistakes relating to the business and we will be most assuredly coming after the Guardian \u0026amp you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9855bb8187365536c1a04191fd367df3e97ef452/0_72_3330_1997/master/3330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=57e1a11754ab4a98fd743c14dcbcd50d 1240w","title":"financial doubts over national citizen service david cameron big society youth programme","story":"The most visible legacy of David Cameron’s “big society”, a £1.5bn taxpayer-funded scheme that encourages teenagers to get involved in their communities, is under scrutiny amid evidence that it is failing to deliver value for money.The National Citizen Service, which was launched in 2011, brings together young people from different backgrounds for a programme of personal and social development. It offers a three- to four-week part-residential programme where 15- to 17-year-olds work in teams building life skills, taking on challenges, making friends and contributing to their community.Almost £1bn of the budget for its current programme, which runs until 2020, has yet to be spent, prompting frenzied bidding for contracts among organisations that provide activity placements during school holidays.But the commissioning process has experienced problems. The NCS Trust, which oversees the service, recently dropped a claim to recover £780,000 against one provider, Engage4Life Ltd, which went into liquidation in December 2015.Last year the House of Commons public accounts committee concluded that the service “may no longer be justifiable” if it failed to meet its targets for increasing the number of participants, or achieve its longterm societal aims at a cheaper cost per head. According to the committee, the trust paid providers about £10m in 2016 for places that were not filled. As of last December just £200,000 had been recovered.The NCS, which was supposed to find 101,000 places for young people aged 16 to 17 in the last financial year, confirmed to the Observer that it had fallen short of this target.The organisation has also seen some senior members of staff leave.Natasha Kizzie, its director of marketing, left last month. Several others have joined a consultancy called Simpact CIC which advises clients on how to bid for contracts.An NCS spokeswoman said it was recommissioning its partner network to “help grow scale and impact in the years ahead”.She said: “The NCS recommissioning tender process will be fair, open and transparent for all interested parties. As with any public procurement we operate under strict regulations and take our responsibilities seriously. Everyone will receive the same information, and be asked to bid on that information alone. All suppliers will be asked to sign a conflict of interest form as part of the tender process.”NCS said that nearly 400,000 young people had benefited from its services, making it the fastest- growing youth programme in more than a century.It said an independent evaluation confirmed that for every £1 spent on its summer programme, NCS delivers between £1.15 and £2.42 of benefits back to society, while separate research found that it helped foster greater understanding and integration among 16- to 17-year-olds from different backgrounds.But Cat Smith, Labour’s shadow minister for voter engagement and youth affairs, said closer scrutiny of the service should be a government priority, given that youth services had seen their funding cut by more than £400m over the past six years.“The NCS provides great opportunities for young people, but we cannot allow this government to turn a blind eye to its failings.“The public need to know that every penny is spent effectively and that NCS providers pitching for new contracts this year will do so in a fair and transparent manner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df87dc82a726dc76e37a38ed655b6d2776782aa/0_0_3863_2319/master/3863.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9e31cab67b636131d7f69e430252ebb 1240w","title":"daniel ricciardo claims chinese grand prix as verstappen clips vettel","story":"Daniel Ricciardo won the Chinese Grand Prix for Red Bull from sixth on the grid after a remarkable late charge through the field, where he took advantage of new tyres and exploited them brilliantly to take the lead and the win. In an incident-packed final third Valtteri Bottas secured second for Mercedes, with Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen in third. The two leading championship contenders Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel finished in fourth and eighth respectively.It had looked to be in Vettel’s grasp until the pit stops and a late safety car changed the complexion of the race and he was disappointed that he was clipped by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen late in the meeting which cost him further places. Hamilton, who had been off the pace in qualifying, and did not look able to challenge for the lead may breathe a sigh of relief that he emerged with the championship deficit to Vettel reduced from 17 to nine points.It is Ricciardo’s sixth career victory and the first time he has won in China. His last win was at Baku last season, his only victory in 2017 and it is the first for Red Bull this season. His run had been against the odds from before qualifying. An engine problem in final practice meant he barely made it into the first qualifying session but his team worked tirelessly to fix it and got him out just in time. He rewarded them with a remarkable drive to claim the win.Opting to set their time in Q2 on the ultrasoft tyres with which they started the race, rather than the soft chosen by the front four and taking advantage of a late safety car gave the Australian fresh rubber for the final third, which he exploited with his usual commitment and verve. This is finally the start to the campaign the Australian wanted, after he took a grid penalty at the opening round in Melbourne and retired in Bahrain due to a power failure.Vettel made a clean start, aggressively squeezing Raikkonen into turn one but a charge from Max Verstappen saw both the Finn and Hamilton lose a place to the Dutchman on the opening lap, with Bottas moving up to second. Out front however Vettel promptly stretched his legs and opened a gap. With the Ferrari proving to have the race pace it showed in qualifying, he was two seconds clear within three laps.The order at the front was static until the pit stops, when Verstappen pitted for the medium tyre on lap 18, emerging behind Hamilton on track and the British driver stopped a lap later, looking for the undercut on Raikkonen. Bottas followed him after one further lap and the Finn emerged in front of Verstappen. Ferrari however kept their drivers out until lap 21 when Vettel pitted and it proved costly. The undercut had worked for Bottas who had put in some very quick sectors and the Finn was in front of the German, who had taken a slightly longer stop of 2.8 seconds, after his stop. With the exception of Verstappen and Ricciardo the leaders were looking for a one-stop race and Bottas now had track position over Vettel.Ferrari opted to keep Raikkonen out and he led, but on old rubber was not lapping quickly and he was caught by Bottas and Vettel. Vettel was pressuring the Finn, now caught between the two Ferraris. Bottas dealt with it decisively on lap 27 going round the outside of Raikkonen, round the outside of one and two making it stick through three and Vettel promptly followed him through.The safety car came out on lap 31 after the two Toro Rossos clashed leaving debris on the track and it was the turning point of the race. It gave Red Bull the chance to pit both their drivers again, and crucially, fit fresh soft rubber to the end. Racing resumed on lap 36, with Hamilton up to third after the Red Bull stops. Verstappen on new rubber tried to pass him through eight but the British driver squeezed him wide and Verstappen went off track. It was only delaying the inevitable however as Ricciardo then made a superb move to pass Hamilton, late braking into the hairpin at 14 and Verstappen then caught and passed him on lap 42.Ricciardo was on a charge however and then swept past Vettel on lap 42 down the back straight putting him into second. Worse was to come for the German, when on lap 43 Verstappen went late up the inside of Vettel at the hairpin, but collected him on the way, causing them both to spin. Verstappen later admitted it had been his fault. It dropped Vettel down the field and Verstappen was given a 10-second penalty for the clumsy attempt. For Vettel there was further pain when Fernando Alonso in the McLaren passed him to take seventh just two laps from the end.Out front Ricciardo had caught Bottas on lap 44 and he ed up the inside of turn six in a breathtaking move to take the lead. He held it to the flag for a superb, deserved race win, that once again highlighted why his overtaking skills are so highly rated.Verstappen finished in fourth but was classified fifth after his penalty. Renault’s Nico Hülkenberg was in sixth, with his team-mate Carlos Sainz in ninth and Kevin Magnussen’s Haas in tenth.

The 25-year-old, who finished fourth at the World Championships marathon in London last summer, had looked set for gold but he began to sway in distress and fell over on the curb.He managed to rouse himself and briefly continued but supported himself several times using the metal barriers lining the course. But he collapsed again shortly afterwards, hitting his head on one of the roadside barriers. Hawkins was taken to hospital and is sat up and talking with no obvious long term damage done but fellow athletes and former athletes were damning of how long it took for professional assistance to arrive.Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were “big questions” for the local organising committee and medical staff. “That should never happen,” she said.Some spectators even took pictures of a stricken Hawkins with nobody seeming to offer any help. Commentating on the BBC, former middle distance runner Steve Cram said it was “a disgrace” that it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins.“I’m just concerned for his welfare,” Cram said, “He hit his head on the barrier. I’m sorry if you’re watching this at home, it’s really distressing. He’s going to hurt himself and there’s nobody anywhere near. We should have some more medical attention.” “This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point. Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They’ve got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it’s disgraceful.”Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive, said: “I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today’s marathon. We are offering every assistance possible to Callum and Team Scotland.” “Gold Coast 2018 has put in place a wide range of measures to ensure athlete welfare and the response of medical staff this morning was within agreed response guidelines and timeframes. I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Gold Coast 2018.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7ca35979e3aa78a1078364da6baac8808114a0/0_31_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=96b6a799fe0ea998ad67b4e72c61ba35 1240w","title":"davy russell bounces back michael o leary sacking to win grand national","story":"Resilience is needed for any Grand National victory and Davy Russell finally got his reward here for proving perhaps the only employee Michael O’Leary could not get rid of. Just over four years ago, O’Leary called time on their relationship as owner and principal jockey but Russell rode his way back into the Ryanair man’s good books, leading to this shared moment of glory in the biggest jumps race of them all.Russell seemed at a low ebb in December 2013, when O’Leary fired him over the most famous cup of tea in the history of Irish jumps racing. He was in his mid-30s, at an age when many a fine rider has decided to do something less dangerous, and O’Leary was not the only one who felt the jockey should have been more effective on the track.But, when asked at the time what he would do next, Russell made it clear that stopping was not in his thoughts. “The same as I do every other day, try and take over the world,” he said.“He’s in a group of elite Irish jockeys, there’s Ruby Walsh, Barry Geraghty, Paul Carberry was one of them before he retired. Barry and Ruby have always been champion jockeys, winning all the best races. Davy’s career has been up and down, characterised by periods of great talent and achievement but also fallow periods. And it’s the way he keeps coming back and back again.”Russell’s craggy features might make him look dour, and the public perception of him is probably as one of the hard men of the weighing room. But he has used his moments of greatest triumph, here and after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Lord Windermere, to acknowledge those he has lost, performing an idiosyncratic wave to the heavens that he copied from a film called 8 Seconds.Years ago, he acknowledged an unnamed friend he lost as a child. After a success at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, he paid tribute to his mother, who had died days before. He dedicated this win to his friend Pat Smullen, a Derby-winning Flat jockey who was diagnosed with a tumour last month.“I was speaking to him the other morning and he’s as tough as nails,” Russell said. Clutching the trophy, he added: “What would I give to be sharing this with my mother?”Had he been beaten, he would have blamed the decision to “wake up” Tiger Roll on the run to the final fence, mindful of the horse’s reputation as “a bit of a monkey”.“He had fallen a little bit asleep on me going to the second-last and I’d saved a lot throughout the race. I needed to wake him up and he came alight with me and winged the last. There was a long way to go and, to be fair to the horse, he was brave.”That decision to press on cost Tiger Roll precious energy and he tired so badly in the last 100 yards that he was almost collared. “That’s the choice I made,” Russell reflected. “Obviously it wasn’t the best choice to make but there was a reason behind doing it.“If I’d finished second, I’d be a long ways out of the racecourse by this stage, disappointed with myself. But I didn’t and I’m here and everybody wants to talk to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ab55a2eec0455c6b522582b220a89d0f4c899d/87_41_2846_1992/master/2846.jpg?w=2750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36d7d8afb73d7606b8fc3401692e1522 5500w","title":"the unseen red rum in pictures","story":"After Red Rum’s second Grand National victory in 1974, Jeremy Hoare was invited by trainer Ginger McCain to meet and photograph the legendary racehorse at his Southport Yard.

Ricciardo is certainly the driver of the day, and he’ll tackle the rest of the season with a win in the bank. If you see Lewis Hamilton over the next few days maybe don’t mention that Mercedes are winless after three...Keep on eye on our ongoing F1 coverage, and we’ll see you at the next race. There’s likely to be plenty of chat about this race in the wash-up, almost all of it surrounding Red Bull. The focus may be on Verstappen’s death-defying driving, but credit must go to Ricciardo for a fantastic drive.After the crowd is roped into an early round of applause from a false finish in the Australian national anthem it’s time for the trophy presentation. Then the celebrations will go - as we say in Daniel’s homeland - “right off”. The shoe is out, with a great shot of Bottas standing behind him looking about as unimpressed as any human possibly could. He’s challenged for disinterest by Raikkonen in the podium photo.We nearly had some more drama on the way back to the garages.Lap 56 - Red Bull and Daniel Ricciardo are on the board in 2018! He’s driven a fantastic race to win the Chinese Grand Prix. It’s his sixth win from outside the top three on the grid.Carlos Sainz has one longing look at Vettel on the second last turn, but decides he’s too far behind and settles for ninth.Lap 55 - Alonso goes past Vettel into 7th, and he’s running so badly that even Carlos Sainz next in the queue might have a go. Vettel complains over the radio that he was run off the track, but to be fair he’s had one of those days so let him go.Lap 54 - With two laps to run, Ricciardo is charging away. He’s almost seven seconds up now.Magnussen is your last man in the points, comfortably ahead of Perez.Lap 53 - Brendon Hartley has done me in! Just as I was about to launch a speaking tour about retirement free races he pulls out.The only crucial battles left are Bottas vs Raikkonen vs Verstappen for 2nd3rd4th and Alonso within a second of Vettel for 7th.Lap 52 - Vettel has got problems, losing ground on 6th placed Hulkenberg and being outpaced by Alonso in 8th.Raikkonen is closing on Bottas, and may be within range to have a go at him in the next lap.Ricciardo has got this sewn up unless something goes drastically wrong.Lap 51 - We’ve got five laps to go, and Ricciardo is now nearly five seconds ahead. Raikkonen is within range of Bottas, but not getting close enough to launch a move.And more on the ever controversial Verstappen:Lap 50 - Ricciardo has got this in his grasp. He’s 4.2 seconds ahead of Bottas, who is busy trying to ward off Kimi. Looks like Mercedes will go an unprecedented three races in a row without a win.Somehow despite all that chaos we’ve still got all 20 cars running. My own personal record of being on deck for 3 of 8 races in history without a retirement is on.Lap 49 - Christian Horner of Red Bull says his team will ‘clench their butt cheeks’ and hope for the best with Ricciardo at the front. He’s 4.3 seconds ahead of Bottas now, and looking comfortable unless something bizarre happens.Bottas is now only half a second ahead of Raikkonen.Lap 48 - Verstappen gets past Hamilton without incident. The penalty may bring him back behind the Mercedes, but now that he’s got clear air he can try and build a big enough gap that the penalty won’t matter.Meanwhile, Raikkonen has taken advantage of all the chaos to comfortably sit third.Lap 47 - The lead is now over four seconds. More importantly we’ve got Verstappen looking at Hamilton again. Ricciardo may be forced to use the shoe to try and defend his teammate against a surprise MercedesFerrari alliance after the race.Lap 46 - Verstappen has been handed a 10 second penalty. If the race finished now he’d finish in 9th place.Ricciardo is streaking to victory, with a fastest lap 1.36.221. Fancy champagne looks like it will be introduced to a sweaty shoe.The top 10 as it stands:Lap 45 - The Red Bull of Ricciardo finds the narrowest gap inside Bottas, the Mercedes yields under pressure of an imminent collision and lets him go. He’s straight through to a 1.5 second lead by the end of the lap.Race control is investigating the VettelVerstappen collision.Lap 44 - At the front the gap is down to 0.4 seconds and Ricciardo is all over the wing of Bottas.Lap 43 - Bottas leads by 1.1 seconds over Ricciardo. The Red Bull has pulled well away from Vettel. Verstappen has hit Vettel! They are both back in the race, but down to 5th and 6th respectively.Will there be anyone not feuding with Max by the end of the season?Lap 42 - Verstappen is back from the dead and past Hamilton! Lewis was struggling for grip, and lost fourth place to his rival.Even better for Red Bull, Ricciardo has gone past Vettel and into second place. He’s well on the trail of Bottas now - 1.5 seconds behind.Lap 41 - Ricciardo sets a new fastest lap with a 1.36.608. He’s half a second behind Vettel. Verstappen is back on Hamilton’s tail, only 0.5 of a second behind.Lap 40 - Ricciardo grabs Hamilton with a great passing move, much to the delight of his mechanics. He’s now 3rd.Reader Dan writes in on the subject of Raikkonen being used as a mobile blocking unit for Vettel. It’s no wonder Kimi always looks miserable. He shouldn’t accept a life of being Vettel’s sidekick. Ferrari ruin the intention of the sport by always favouring only 1 driver and sacrificing the other to try to help them. Many years without a driver championship prove this doesn’t work. Lap 39 - Verstappen runs off the road trying to pass Hamilton! He loses fourth, and by narrowly avoiding a calamity we miss the very real chance of a good old fashioned fistfight between drivers.The gap at the front is 1.4 seconds and falling. Vettel is coming for Bottas.Lap 38 - After Bottas’ 1.7 second gap to Vettel, the rest of the top five are close together. Hamilton is 0.9 behind in third, Verstappen 0.6 back in fourth and Ricciardo a second behind his teammate.At least the Toro Rosso twitterist can see the funny side of the Gasly debacle.Lap 37 - Ricciardo has a look at Raikkonen for 5th but can’t make it work. He finally sticks the move into the hairpin and grabs the position.Vettel is 1.6 behind, but he’s also got problems with Hamilton less than a second behind him.Lap 36 - Bottas timed his restart perfectly, and now leads by nearly two seconds.All the action at the restart came lower in the field, with Alonso getting past Grosjean and into ninth. Gasly has been given a 10 second penalty, showing that the stewards didn’t agree with his version of events either.Lap 35 - We’re racing again. Bottas stays ahead from Vettel, Hamilton, Verstappen and Raikkonen.Lap 34 - The safety car is back in after this lap and we’ll be on again. The field will be bunched up and anything could happen. Hold on to your hats and ensure you’re sitting level in the middle of your chair.Lap 33 - Another lap under safety car. Perez has pitted as well. The cleanup team is on the track, sweeping furiously like a Winter Olympic curling team to clear the way for a restart.Lap 32 - Hulkenberg, Sainz and Ocon all took advantage of the safety car (as correctly predicted by Renault pre-race) to come in. Debris is still all over the corner where the GaslyHartley collision happened. The accident is now under investigation.Lap 31 - Safety car! Plenty of debris on the corner where the Toro Rosso incident happened. Red Bull has used the opportunity to double stack their drivers in the pits.Lap 30 - Temporary Yellow flags as two Toro Rosso cars come together. Gasly has a go at Hartley, and collides with him going into the turn. He doesn’t share the widely held view that he was at fault and berates his teammate on the radio. They’re both back in the race, still no retirements.Bottas leads Vettel by 0.9.Lap 29 - Charles Leclerc is the first man to tempt fate on a retirement, spinning off but managing to recover and rejoin the race. If he’d not been able to get started again there would have certainly been a virtual safety car.The gap at the front is still just over a second. Verstappen is 5.7 back from Vettel in third, and he’s got two seconds on Hamilton.Lap 27 - Raikkonen has stopped, and in a win for occupational health and safety fanatics everywhere he’s made it back to the track without any of his pit crew being maimed. He drops down to 6th on his exit.Lap 26 - Bottas has a tentative look at Raikkonen, but opts not to attack. Late in the lap he goes around the outside and eventually wins a wheel-to-wheel battle. Raikkonen has a go towards his inside, opening the door for Vettel to pass him as well and go into second.The Mercedes leads, but with only a 0.6 second safety net to Vettel.Lap 25 - It’s down to 0.6 at the front, as Bottas sits in a Ferrari sandwich with Vettel slowly gaining on him. If he can get past Kimi quickly he’ll be in a great position to win this race.Lap 24 - The lead is down to 2.7 seconds, and Vettel is right on Bottas’ hammer now. He’s just over a second ahead of the Mercedes. Kimi is still going, like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer tried to drive as long as possible before running out of fuel.Lap 23 - Vettel has only shaved a tenth of a second off Bottas, but the Mercedes is advancing on Raikkonen and may end up being slowed by him soon. It’s still 4.8 seconds at the front.Last man on track is Leclerc.Lap 22 - Raikkonen is 6.2 ahead of Bottas and still on track. Maybe his pit crew have put a ban on him? Bottas is 1.4 up on Vettel in the crucial battle for what is at the moment second.Meanwhile, approaching the halfway mark of the race we’re still without a retirement. Should it stay that way, it will be the third time I’ve done a live blog where everyone has finished. I’m willing to discuss terms with Formula One to retire from the game.Lap 21 - Vettel comes out of the pits and is just nabbed by Bottas. He’s now got 1.3 seconds on the Ferrari and will take the lead when Raikkonen pits.Lap 20 - Bottas exits well clear of Verstappen, who just set the new fastest lap of the race with a 1.37.755.Vettel is coming in from first, temporarily allowing Raikkonen to take the lead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4fe0cd9e2ee06ae1ef041fbf395aae86750f9cf/0_0_4638_3162/master/4638.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=418c4ee7c538a3b5ef414d1a172a67e8 1240w","title":"instructions for correct assembly review bonnar and horrocks star in clever sci fi satire","story":"Royal Court, LondonBonnar and Horrocks are excellent as parents attempting to replace their dead son with another straight from the box in Thomas Eccleshare’s quirky dystopian dramaThomas Eccleshare is a quirky, off-the-wall writer. In Pastoral, seen at the HighTide festival in 2013, he created black comedy out of impending ecological disaster. Now he has written a sci-fi satire about our vain search for programmed perfection. While the play is sharply funny and ingeniously staged, it doesn’t always supply the emotional evidence to reinforce its intellectual arguments. The basic situation is simple: Hari and Max, husband and wife, respectively, are a nice suburban couple who decide to create an ideal flatpack son out of constituent parts. It gradually emerges that their first son, Nick, died of drug addiction. They assemble a replacement, Jan, who conforms to social norms and whose ideas and attitudes can be determined through a remote control. Since Nick and Jan are played by the same actor, a contrast is drawn between the fallible humanity of the one and the machine-tooled precision of the other. Needless to say, predetermined perfection proves to be an impossible dream. As a graduate of the Jacques Lecoq school of physical theatre, Eccleshare comes out of a different box from most British playwrights, but I was struck by his similarity to Alan Ayckbourn. In Ayckbourn’s Henceforward (1987), we saw a composer serviced by an android to whom he related more easily than people and in Comic Potential (1998), TV soaps were populated by computerised robots. There is one particular scene in Eccleshare’s play, when Jan hilariously disrupts a suburban dinner party, that I suspect his forebear would have been delighted to have written. Eccleshare also has the capacity to link the dystopian and the diurnal, as in Hari and Max’s compulsion to compete with their neighbours, who constantly brag about their own high-flying offspring’s achievements. What Eccleshare has to say is true and relevant: we should love people for what they are rather than for what we wish them to be. The action, however, doesn’t always back up the argument, especially in the scenes involving Nick, whose descent into addiction is never motivated or explained. We are clearly meant to assume that, as parents, Max and Hari have failed due to their inability to cope with messy reality. But we don’t learn enough about Nick, in spite of a speech from the girl next door praising his potential, to know whether he was a victim of parental pressure or social circumstance. Even if there is a hole at the play’s heart, it has been assembled by director Hamish Pirie and designer Cai Dyfan as cleverly as the machine-made Jan: scenes that are glimpsed through a rectangular aperture whisk by on a travelator before the set opens up to show us the suburban jungle. Jane Horrocks captures excellently the trim conformity and residual guilt of the maternal Max, while Mark Bonnar suggests the trouble with Hari is that he believes you can build the perfect son out of DIY fervour. Jason Barnett and Michele Austin are equally good as the boastful neighbours. Brian Vernel is outstanding as both the flawed Nick and the mechanised Jan who, as someone observes, has his head screwed on the right way. Yet while the play aims some deft blows at our desire for an unrealisable perfection and is well worth seeing, its own flaws are all too apparent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e204e91189f22fbd62c4f69ab27acd7b0039224a/293_511_2941_1765/master/2941.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ca4a4a0fb12ee983c03dd8c8d3cbf85 1240w","title":"facebook says it voter button is good for turn but should the tech giant be nudging us at all","story":"What do we really know about the influence of the ‘voter button’? On the morning of 28 October last year, the day of Iceland’s parliamentary elections, Heiðdís Lilja Magnúsdóttir, a lawyer living in a small town in the north of the country, opened Facebook on her laptop. At the top of her newsfeed, where friends’ recent posts would usually appear, was a box highlighted in light blue. On the left of the box was a button, similar in style to the familiar thumb of the “like” button, but here it was a hand putting a ballot in a slot. “Today is Election Day!” was the accompanying exclamation, in English. And underneath: “Find out where to vote, and share that you voted.” Under that was smaller print saying that 61 people had already voted. Heiðdís took a screenshot and posted it on her own Facebook profile feed, asking: “I’m a little curious! Did everyone get this message in their newsfeed this morning?”In Reykjavik, 120 miles south, Elfa Ýr Gylfadóttir glanced at her phone and saw Heiðdís’s post. Elfa is director of the Icelandic Media Commission, and Heiðdís’s boss. The Media Commission regulates, for example, age ratings for movies and video games, and is a part of Iceland’s Ministry of Education. Elfa wondered why she hadn’t received the same voting message. She asked her husband to check his feed, and there was the button. Elfa was alarmed. Why wasn’t it being shown to everyone? Might it have something to do with different users’ political attitudes? Was everything right and proper with this election?Iceland had just reached the end of its most arduous and dirty campaign season ever. For weeks, anonymous accounts had been spreading accusations on social media about nearly every political candidate. The country had been flooded with bizarre “exposé” videos on Facebook and YouTube. Some had been viewed millions of times, even though Iceland has only around 340,000 residents. And now this button. Was there a connection?Elfa watched as more and more people responded to Heiðdís’s post. Some had seen the button, others had not. Out and about on election day, Elfa asked everyone she met about it. It was clear that not everyone had received the message. Of those that did, some got it later than others. Some had seen it while scrolling through their Facebook newsfeeds for others it appeared at the top. Meanwhile, responses to Heiðdís’s post appeared to show that users given the button option were not randomly selected either. Minors and non-citizens were not shown it: only those in the voting population. But then, as she was also discovering, not all of them. Was there some kind of pattern?Immediately after the elections were over, the button disappeared. There was no sign of it on Facebook’s company site Newsroom or on any government sites. Elfa rang a friend, Kristín Edwald, chair of the Icelandic Election Commission. Edwald was totally surprised she had never heard about this button. Not even the special commission, given the job of working on an update to the election law, knew what Elfa was talking about.Elfa had an idea why none of the authorities had taken the button seriously: at first glance, Facebook’s get-out-the-vote button seems harmless. What effect could a simple election day reminder possibly have?The Icelandic elections are simply the most recent time the button has been employed for major elections in the west. In the US, it was first used – and fully disclosed by Facebook – in 2008, and again in 2010 and 2012. Facebook has published its own studies about its effects. Initially, despite some scepticism on the left, it was mostly seen as a positive tool, bringing people to the ballot. Facebook was an emerging phenomenon, with a couple of hundred million users.The first known cases of the button being used outside the US are the Scottish referendum in 2014, the Irish referendum in 2015 and the UK election later that year, all of which were communicated by Facebook. After that there was silence about the button – and no further public statements by Facebook. But the company has now revealed, in answer to questions in the preparation of this article, that the button was used in the UK in the 2016 European Union referendum, the 2016 US presidential election that brought Trump to power, and in Germany’s 2017 federal elections.But what effect did it have? That we don’t know. And if Facebook does, it’s not saying. Did its button make a difference in crucial, closely fought recent elections? In the EU referendum in Britain or the election of Trump in the US?In the ongoing debate about the influence of Facebook on politics, the issues largely revolve around third-party applications. The crucial distinction about the vote button is that it is made and operated by Facebook alone: this is Facebook itself becoming a political actor. Indeed, in his testimony to the US Congress, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg proudly cited the use of the button during the last US presidential election.And this was what concerned Elfa in Iceland. The main reason for her worries was a presentation she had seen two weeks before the Icelandic elections, at a conference of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Vienna. It had been part of an OECD panel on fake news, Russian manipulation online and personalised advertising. At the heart of the matter was abuse of social networks by third parties. The button, however, was something else entirely. It was Facebook’s very own tool. And, in contrast to all the speculation around the actual effects of fake news, Facebook had numbers.The presentation had been given by the Austrian digital ambassador to the EU, Ingrid Brodnig. Brodnig had spoken about one of the largest ever experiments in the field of social science. It had taken place on the day of the 2010 US congressional elections, when Facebook suddenly sent a voting reminder to 61 million US users – a quarter of the US voting population. Every US Facebook user over the age of 18 who logged in on election day saw the message. Then a team from Facebook, together with researchers from the University of California at San Diego, weighed Facebook datasets against election returns. The goal was to find out whether the “voter button” actually got out the vote.If Facebook had shown the button to every US voter, more than a million voters could have been mobilised. This was the first scientific evidence of the real influence that the still-new network could have – an important message for Facebook’s potential advertising customers.WEB ONLY Elfa heard all of this for the first time at that conference in Vienna. The Austrian digital ambassador concluded her speech by saying: “There has never before been so much power in the hands of a single company.”In 2012, Facebook once again tested its capacity for influence. This time in the US presidential elections. It was announced on Newsroom that all users would be shown the button (which turned out not to be the case). The results were published (by Facebook – there was no independent study) in April 2017 in the science journal Plos One. The button had worked again: 270,000 additional votes were cast.On US election day in 2012, media reports indicate that Facebook did other tests to optimise the button. Even today not much is known about them. Facebook has never revealed publicly how many variations of the button they tested. But the company apparently wanted to know which worked better: when Facebook simply displayed the button or when it came as a recommendation from a friend.This was the reason only some people saw the election day reminder at the top of their newsfeeds while others saw it as a post shared by a friend. Some people saw the button only at their computers, others saw it on all devices (a Facebook project manager at the time, Antonio Martínez, says that in 2012 he heard from co-workers that developers were undecided whether to show the button on iPhones: that alone could bias election results, they worried, because iPhone users tended to be more urban and liberal). There were multiple variations in the text some read “I’m a voter”, while others came up “I voted”.The key questions are: how much of a difference does it make when Facebook turns on its button? And could Facebook potentially distort election results simply by increasing voter participation among only a certain group of voters – namely, Facebook users? At its core, Facebook is an ongoing experiment being conducted on society. In Facebook’s eyes, we are all the subjects of a global experiment in profit-maximisation. No one can predict precisely what the effects of a certain program alteration will be, so everything is constantly being tested.Facebook can see in great detail how we react to every single alteration they make. The Facebook algorithm that’s always being talked about does not exist. It’s more accurate to say there are many continuously-under-development programmatic threads that interact to determine what comes up in our inidual Facebook feeds. The aim is always to increase “engagement” – the time we spend interacting with the platform. For our part, we notice that we are being experimented on just about as much as rats in a maze do.Only once has Facebook apologised for an experiment: in 2014 it was revealed that it had tested 689,003 users to determine how much their feelings could be influenced. During the “emotional contagion“ experiment for one test group, positive posts from friends were partially withheld for the other group, negative ones. Even if the effects were slight, Facebook showed itself to be a sort of thermostat, with which the moods of its users could be regulated. The very thought of it: a company which, in order to test its product, risks the psychological wellbeing of its users – this created an uproar. But one thing Facebook learned from the backlash was that it was better keeping things secret.When something problematic does get revealed, Facebook turns to the same arguments: it’s the fault of ill-intentioned, careless or clueless users. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, Facebook first blamed the users whose data had been misused for being unable to comprehend its terms of use policy. Then they cast Cambridge Analytica as the villains who had taken advantage of user ignorance. Facebook is always the victim, never the culprit.The Facebook employee who first exported the “voter button” outside the US is the London-based Californian Elizabeth Linder. She is 34, a Princeton graduate and was an early recruit at Facebook, starting in 2008 (she left in April 2016). In an upmarket vegan restaurant in central London, she relates how she built up Facebook’s “global politics and government outreach” department. Working from her London office, her task was to persuade the political classes of Europe, the Middle East and Africa that Facebook was the place where voters were – and that, therefore, politics has to be there too. At first it was rough going. “The politicians all thought Facebook was just something for young people,” she said.Then came the Arab spring. Young activists used Facebook to network, spread their ideas and organise demonstrations. Governments in north Africa were toppled. The Arab spring was the best marketing for Facebook ever. It turned a toy into a tool of power. Politicians and government officials from all over were busy trying to contact Facebook, and it was Linder they spoke to. She has advised the Vatican and British parliament she brought the Dutch royal family on to Facebook. She says she spent the eve of the second Tahrir uprising with the social media department of the then Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi. She had one clear aim: “Fulfilling our mission to make the world a better place.” In Macedonia, she advised pro-Europe organisations in Lithuania, Radio Free Europe in Uganda, women’s groups.Did Facebook have a bigger plan? She says not. Were there concerns about potential political influence? Only occasionally. One example she mentions is Lebanon, where she avoided giving political consultation, not wanting to accidentally advise people who could be on a terrorist watchlist. Who determined when the button should be deployed? Her alone, Linder says. The Scottish independence referendum was, in her view, a good place to start: only two camps, similar to the US. “The second one, I think, was a referendum in Ireland.” Then the 2015 elections in Britain. The long-term goal was to use the button in “every major election”. In Britain in 2015, Facebook made an effort to communicate it, did a lot of marketing. Later, they wouldn’t.And yet there is indeed one public announcement of Facebook’s plans to implement the “voter button” worldwide, from 2014. At that time, the project was publicly well received. Since then, however, Facebook has been silent on the matter. There is no data or any accounting available about where the button has been deployed, except for one announcement in India.Searches for the button on the internet yield private screenshots posted from many places, including India, Colombia, Holland, Ireland, Hong Kong, South Africa – even from the European parliamentary elections. Also represented are countries in difficult geopolitical environments, such as South Korea and Israel, and endangered democracies such as the Philippines, Turkey and Hungary.What remains unclear about the button – this powerful tool that a US corporation can insert into elections globally completely free of public scrutiny – is when and why it gets deployed. Do you have to pay to have it activated? Or is it enough simply to have a cordial relationship with a Facebook employee?“As far as I know, there is no public list of where the ‘voter button’ has been used,” says Linder. And within the company? “Yes.”She left Facebook in 2016. Why? “I wanted to stay in Europe,” she says simply. When pressed, she shrugs. It had always been her dream to live in London. And, no, she has never been to Iceland.When I approached Facebook to ask why they had used the button in Iceland, a public relations firm replied: “We show a message on election day to remind people to vote.” Its explanation for the button not being shown to every user had to do with users’ inidual notification settings or their use of an older version of the app. As to how strongly voter participation had been influenced in Iceland, there was no comment. Nor did Facebook say who was actually shown the button and who was not. That information is “unfortunately” not available “for any country”. The list of countries in which the button had been used could not be provided either.Why doesn’t the company want to reveal this information? To what extent has the button influenced election results in recent years? What political data is being gathered? Are models being tested and strengthened? Voter participation in Iceland turned out to be surprisingly high. There were increases among both young and old, even though experts had been speaking before the poll of a general sense of election exhaustion. Whether this was due to the button, and who benefited most from the additional votes, is impossible to tell without more information from Facebook.Facebook is a US company without an office in Iceland. In a certain way, its use of the button constitutes interference by a foreign actor. Facebook has meddled in the democratic elections of a foreign country, and no one outside of the company seems to know anything about it. Replies to inquiries with Iceland’s justice ministry, election commission and intelligence services indicate that they were ignorant on the subject. Even Páll Þórhallsson, the chief legal counsel to the prime minister and an internationally experienced media lawyer, had not been informed. But the deployment of the button was probably not illegal under Icelandic law. Legislators could hardly have predicted these kinds of methods, so why formulate any legal text to cover them?Facebook had sent a team to Iceland, on 10 October 2017, just 18 days before the election. In a parliamentary meeting room – accessible only with a pass – two representatives, Anika Geisel of Facebook’s politics and government outreach team and Janne Elvelid, the company’s Stockholm rep, had been meeting leaders from the major parties. They had given a two-hour introduction on the ways politicians could engage on Facebook with potential voters – what they could achieve with the platform, how they could maximise the “engagement” of their fans. The examples they showed were in German. Facebook cited the page of Sahra Wagenknecht, of Germany’s far-left party die Linke, as well as the fan page of then soon-to-be Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, as examples of “best practices”. It was a standard promotional presentation, with examples pulled from the Austrian and German elections – the slides were in German.But why was Facebook in the country at all? The tips their team gave were banal. The presentation left most visitors wondering why the meeting had been held – there was no mention of paying Facebook or of advertising opportunities. Nor were there any answers given to the pressing questions on who was behind the wave of fake news videos that had flooded the country. The “voter button” wasn’t mentioned. Facebook had been invited by the conservative Independence party, which declined to comment for this article. Elfa, who speaks Swedish, decided to email Janne Elvelid. At first he responded warmly but when she sent him questions about the button, he suddenly had no more time for written communications. She should call him, he said.So on 8 February this year she did call him. He had been assigned to Iceland, he told her. He had discussed deploying the “button” beforehand, by telephone, with someone in Iceland’s justice ministry. Facebook had sent the button to every user, he said. Still, Facebook can’t really tell who actually sees the button algorithms and user settings would ultimately determine that. Facebook cannot control who deactivates which notifications.In statement after statement, Facebook insists it supports democracy. But in Iceland, after six elections in one decade, with confidence in the political system shaking, and when democracy needs nothing more desperately than trust, Elfa was left with nothing but doubt.The experiment is still going on. Early last month, an acquaintance sent Elfa a screenshot from the elections in Italy. The button showed up there too. In response to my questions, Facebook stated that it had also deployed the button in the last federal and regional elections in Germany as well as for the Brexit referendum.In Iceland, outrage about Facebook is beginning to mount. Meetings are being held, including with MPs and the prime minister’s office. Elfa is still wondering why Facebook is investing energy in introducing its button all over the world. The only explanation that makes sense to her is that elections help to bring people to the platform that users, as soon as they see that their friends voted, will take their political battles to Facebook, and, with their increased engagement, help Facebook bring in more advertising. That would be the profit. The cost is borne by democracy. This is an edited, translated version of an article that first appeared in Das Magazin in Switzerland.

The epic ride ends in a cosy pub just as rain sweeps in“You used to be able to ride through here,” I said. “Yes,” replied my friend Mark, “but that was more than 20 years ago.”We were looking for a dirt road through Cwm Henog forest, to the west of Llanwrtyd Wells in mid-Wales. I cycled around here regularly in the 1980s and 90s when I started mountain biking but things change, even in these remote hills: I simply couldn’t find that old road.But we had a good alternative route planned for our three-day gravel bike adventure. We’d head north on a minor road from Llanwrtyd Wells through thick woodland along the Irfon river, then turn left at the hamlet of Abergwesyn to ride over lovely Abergwesyn Common, with impressive crags looming on either side.Things became more challenging at the Devil’s Staircase, a hideously steep climb up the southern slopes of the Cambrian mountains, where I got off and pushed. I was “bikepacking” on a relatively heavy gravel bike with knobbly tyres and a large seatpack, and carrying a small rucksack.A gravel bike, if you were wondering, is essentially a road bike that has relaxed frame angles (for a more comfortable riding position), can run wider, knobbly tyres for riding off-road and comes with mudguards and mounts for panniers.Our route would take in minor country roads, forest roads and dirt tracks in the Cambrian mountains, although our first off-road action didn’t come until we’d sped down the north-west side of the Devil’s Staircase, along the eastern bank of Llyn Brianne reservoir and across the dam’s impressive spillway to hit the dirt road along the reservoir’s western shore.My knobbly tyres sailed over the rough surface and soon we were in Soar-y-Mynydd, a whitewashed chapel built in 1822, and apparently the most remote chapel in Wales.From here, we rode on rough tarmac for 10 miles or so across windy moorlands to Tregaron, and rooms for the night at Y Talbot hotel (doubles from £85 B\u0026ampB), which may have the UK’s most powerful showers – perfect after a day’s biking.Next day, after a huge breakfast, we had an easy start, riding along the flat Ystwyth Trail, which follows the route of the old Aberystwyth to Carmarthen railway beside Cors Caron, a huge raised bog where otters thrive, along with the region’s soaring red kites.This being mid-Wales, it was only a matter of time before things began to go uphill. At Pontrhydfendigaid, we hit the smooth tarmac of the B4343, then climbed on a potholed road east across open moorland to the far-flung Teifi Pools and eventually, after five miles and 300 metres of ascent, we were back on dirt.This dirt track wound through some of the most isolated terrain in the UK, between vast expanses of desolate moorland, then skirted the steel-grey waters of the Claerwen reservoir before dropping down to the Elan Valley. Here we enjoyed some shelter from an increasingly strong wind as we descended into the thickly wooded valley and, for the first time in over 10 miles, encountered people again. It’s probably fair to say there are few roads south of Scotland – even dirt roads – where you can travel such a distance in complete solitude.After a night at the Elan Valley Hotel (doubles from £75 B\u0026ampB) – opened when the Elan Valley reservoirs were being built at the turn of the 20th century – our final day saw us cycling past Rhayader and down to the Wye, which we crossed on a narrow suspension bridge sporting a sign advising cyclists to dismount. I’d be pleased to see a person riding a bike across that bridge …From here, a gradual climb saw us wend our way along an ancient moorland bridleway as southerly winds threw big, splashy raindrops in our faces – just as you’d expect in Wales.By the time we got back to Llanwrtyd Wells and rode past the Neuadd Arms, the rain was hammering down, so we felt duty bound to pop in for a pint. Thirty years ago, before trail centres took over, this pub was a focal point of British mountain biking maybe the new vogue for gravel biking will bring back those glory days.• Clive Powell in Rhayader hires out mountain and hybrid bikes from £24 a day"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a2cfe2781bc849e8ffc8bfb827d05f569c11a91/0_188_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=5000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253999986c180b5bbedafbfc2eb6d8fd 10000w","title":"eternal sunshine las vegas perfect winter holiday","story":"From stargazing in the desert to world-famous pool parties, Las Vegas offers something for everyone looking to escape the cold and the rainWhen it’s cold, wet and generally miserable in the UK, why not head to Las Vegas for the flip side: sun, swimming pools and outdoor adventures.

Well, almost. An enclosed waterslide plunges nine metres, travelling through an aquarium filled with some 300 sea creatures, including said sharks and sting rays. The H2O bar supplies the drinks, while lounging in the sun is as strenuous as things need to get if you prefer. On the third floor is the Hideout, an infinity pool for over-21s with day beds, chaise lounges and luxury cabanas.Golden Nugget, 129 E.

Orbán won a third term in power after his anti-immigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his ruling Fidesz party in parliament, granting him two-thirds of seats based on preliminary results. In a Facebook post before the rally, organisers called for a recount of ballots, free media, a new election law, as well as more efficient cooperation among opposition parties instead of the bickering seen in the run-up to the vote. In a Facebook post, the rally’s organisers said: “Fidesz’s election system and the government’s hate campaign have pushed the majority into a one-third (parliamentary) minority.” Protesters gathering outside the Opera House, a 19th century neo-Renaissance palace on a majestic downtown avenue, were waving Hungary’s and the European Union’s flags, with whistles and horns blaring. The demonstrators marched towards the parliament, chanting: “We are the majority.” In contrast to Orbán’s closing rally in his native Székesfehérvár last week, where the overwhelming majority of supporters were middle-aged and elderly people, the Budapest protest attracted many from younger generations. “We are disappointed and I think lots of us are disappointed with the election results, which, I think, were not clean,” said 26-year-old Palma, who declined to give her surname. Palma, who came to the protest with a friend, said she believed the Hungarian election system gave an unfair advantage to Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party. However, she was also displeased with opposition parties. “They are pathetic,” she said. “It is terrible that they are so weak, unable to reach a compromise and they kill each other instead of joining forces for us.” Nationalist Jobbik and the Socialists, which have the biggest opposition groups in parliament, had said they would join the protest, which was to march to parliament near the Danube river.The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said the election did not offer opposition parties a level playing field amid a host of problems marring a vote that on the whole respected fundamental rights.Orbán, who has transformed himself from a liberal anti-communist hero into a nationalist icon admired by the far right across Europe, brushed aside the criticism, telling the OSCE, “thanks for the contribution.” A major opposition newspaper has closed since the election, marking another milestone in the gradual decline of media pluralism in Hungary. The right-wing prime minister projected himself as a saviour of Hungary’s Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, an image which resonated with millions of voters, especially in rural areas. But the opposition’s poor showing was at least partly of its own making as rival candidates split the anti-government vote in five districts in Budapest, where preliminary results showed a slim Fidesz victory. “Zero, zero, zero,” 29-year-old Dia Szenasi said about the opposition, adding that all leftist parties should have joined forces to have a better chance of ousting Orbán.

It is seen as a test for Đukanović, who favours European integration over closer ties to its traditional ally Moscow.Đukanović, the country’s dominant politician, and his Democratic Party of Socialists have ruled Montenegro for nearly 30 years. The outgoing president, Filip Vujanović, is not running, due to term limits.About 530,000 voters can choose between several candidates in the country on the Adriatic Sea. Đukanović’s main challenger is Mladen Bojanić, who is backed by several opposition groups, including pro-Russian parties. Polls suggest the 56-year-old Đukanović could win more than half of the votes on Sunday and avoid a runoff. Casting his vote on Sunday, Bojanić described Đukanović as an “autocrat leading Montenegro into a dictatorship”.“The majority in Montenegro want a free and democratic Montenegro,” Bojanić said.Đukanović was prime minister during a tense October 2016 parliamentary election when authorities said they thwarted a pro-Russian coup attempt designed to prevent the country from joining Nato.He led Montenegro to independence from its much larger neighbour Serbia in 2006 and was behind the Nato bid. He hopes next to steer the country into the European Union.Bojanić, an economic expert and former lawmaker, has accused the ruling party of corruption and links to organised crime following a spike in crime-related violence.The fractured opposition parties supporting Bojanić include the pro-Russian Democratic Front, whose two main leaders are on trial for taking part in the alleged 2016 coup attempt.Two Russian citizens also are being tried in absentia for the plot, which prosecutors said included a plan to assassinate Đukanović. The Kremlin has denied involvement.Voter Zdravko Ivanovic, 84, praised Đukanović’s leadership after leaving a polling station Sunday in Podgorica, the capital. He described Đukanović as “the best statesman and prime minister, the best and finest Montenegrin giant”. Radmila Čagorović, a voter in her late 50s, disagreed. “We have waited so long for a change,” she said. “I hope it will happen today.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cork County Hall to have exhibition and commemorative plaqueGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after truck driver found dead at Co Wexford portRomanian national Ioan Artene Bob dies after being found in Sean Walsh Park on FridayCrisis management group had recommended in March that McCann should step asideEvent tackles concerns over World Meeting of Families in Ireland, which pope is to attendOscar-nominated film maker says amendment is a symptom of the \u0026lsquoold darkness\u0026rsquoSenator Lynn Ruane says society must move away from blaming those in povertyJackson and Olding have contracts revoked while Gilroy suspended for two weeksGilroy suspended until April 26th after internal review into players\u0026rsquo conductEvery community expresses its basic values in the way in which it treats a language, President Higgins tells rallyGarda\u0026iacute investigating incident on Main Street in Kilcoole at about 4am on SaturdayPentagon appears to have persuaded White House of need for narrowly targeted attackZappone to examine report from UCD-TCD scientists on DNA extraction at burial siteJanet O\u0026rsquoSullivan issues statement to the media in relation to Save the 8th spokesmanIt is understood the dead man was involved in a fight with another driverExtraordinary general meeting \u0026lsquovery constructive\u0026rsquo, says Institute of ObstetriciansCystic fibrosis campaigner is in recovery following operation in DecemberThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s once tallest building to be recognised","story":"It was Ireland’s tallest building for years, much to the satisfaction of Corkonians everywhere, and now Cork County Hall’s status is to be recognised with the unveiling of a plaque to mark its 50-year existence on the banks of the Lee.Mayor of County Cork, Cllr Declan Hurley will unveil the plaque on Monday, recording that Cork County Hall, at the time of its completion on April 16th, 1968, was the tallest building in the country and remained so for four decades.Designed by the then Cork county architect, Patrick McSweeney, the 16-storey building, some 64.3 metres high, superseded Dublin’s Liberty Hall. The Dublin building opened in 1965 and had previously held the title with its 16 storeys standing some 59. 4 metres.Mr Hurley said although it has since been taken over by another Cork building, the 17-storey high Elysian at 68 metres near Cork City Hall as the tallest building in the Republic, Cork County Hall on the Carrigrohane Straight retains a iconic status on Leeside.“Cork County Hall has become synonymous with Cork. It is a landmark building and one which resonates strongly with the people of Cork and in addition to the unveiling of a plaque, Cork County Council is also hosting an exhibition telling the story of the building from inception to completion.”Now standing at 67 metres, following a €50 million re-development in 2006, which incorporated a six-storey extension on its eastern side and an extra storey with a glazed pavilion on the top floor, Cork County Hall continues to dominate the Cork skyline in a striking fashion, he added.Cork County Council chief executive Tim Lucey said high rise was a striking architectural concept, which had not been attempted previously in Ireland in the 1960s, and the construction, which took three years, was notable for the fact that it did not require scaffolding.“When it was completed in 1968, the design was a single, elegantly proportioned, vertical block with a textured surface of precast concrete tracery which formed a lattice work over the building and eliminated the need for scaffolding during construction,” he said.He pointed out the impact the building – along with the iconic bronze sculpture by Oisín Kelly depicting two men admiring the finished project – had on the people of Cork as he recalled the words of his predecessor, Michael Conlon upon its completion.“In 1968 at the official opening, then County Manager Michael Conlon noted this County Hall belonged to the people of Cork. It continues to belong to the people of Cork and will continue to be a building which delivers for the people of Cork,” he said.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462214.1523707848!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limited bombardment reflects little appetite for engagement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe strikes on Syria  were designed to degrade the Syrian regime’s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons. Photograph: SANAAPLasting just 70 minutes and involving 103 missiles, Saturday’s bombardment of Syria was more modest than the rhetoric from Washington, Paris and London portended and is unlikely to serve as a significant deterrent to Bashar al-Assad. If Russian claims that Syrian air defences shot down 71 of the missiles are true, the impact of the operation, which US defence secretary James Mattis described as “a one-time shot”, will be slighter still.The limited nature of the bombardment reflects the political reality that there is little appetite in the US, France or Britain for any significant military engagement in Syria. And the Pentagon appears to have persuaded the White House that the attack had to be narrowly targeted to avoid striking Russian and Iranian military personnel in the country.Theresa May stressed on Saturday that the air strikes were not about regime change or about interfering in a civil war. Instead, they were designed to degrade the Syrian regime’s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons and to send a message that the international community will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons.A YouGov poll conducted in the days before the attack found just one in five in Britain supported the operation, with twice as many saying they opposed it. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the action had no legal basis and May will face tough questions from MPs when she makes a statement in the House of Commons on Monday.Despite the political difficulties, May was always likely to offer British support for the operation, not least as a signal of Britain’s determination to play a global role after Brexit.The airstrikes followed an internal dispute within the Trump administration, with the president and his national security adviser John Bolton favouring a more expansive operation while the Pentagon urged caution. French president Emmanuel Macron was the most resolute of the three leaders in his commitment to striking Syria but in the hours before the attack, he called for dialogue with Russia to be maintained and stepped up in an effort to bring peace and stability to Syria.If Saturday’s operation had the secondary purpose of increasing pressure on Moscow to persuade Assad to reach a peace deal with Syrian opposition forces, there is little immediate sign that it will do so.After seven years of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, Assad is closer to victory than ever before. And if he was responsible for the chemical attack in Douma, his war crime achieved its military objective – on Saturday morning, his forces entered the rebel holdout, predicting that it would be secured within 24 hours.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Family members said to be vetted by immigration and health officials, and given necessitiesOutrage mounts following alleged gang rape and murder of eight-year-old girlFirst naval manoeuvres by China in sensitive waters since 2015 sure to infuriate TaiwanEfforts to disrupt police inquiry deepen fears that religious nationalists acting with impunityJournalists who report on India\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosand mafia\u0026rsquo are frequent victims of violenceTrump says planned meeting with Kim Jong Un will focus on North Korea\u0026rsquos nuclear weaponsDriver reportedly lost control of vehicle when speeding on mountain roadCIA chief Mike Pompeo is leading preparations, CNN reportsSalman Khan (52) sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for 1998 offenceDisgraced ex-president Park Geun-hye\u0026rsquos 24-year sentence no surprise to populaceCase exposed dubious links between government and the \u0026lsquochaebol\u0026rsquo conglomeratesTokyo Letter: As they run out of things to do, officers are becoming more inventive\u0026lsquoDesperate measures\u0026rsquo include redrawing electoral map and \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo crackdownThe women were told to leave a sumo ring while treating an official who had collapsedSalman Khan gets five-year prison sentenceAirline call for recosinderation of abrupt presidential order to close Boracay for six monthsSydney Letter: What so upset Peter Dutton was coverage of his new-found concern for white South African farmersGeneral Wei Fenghe says Chinese and Russian militaries are increasingly closeChinese couple are reunited with their child following her disappearance in 1994Threat to withdraw journalistic credentials under guise of fake news control cancelledThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462308.1523738677!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"myanmar says it has repatriated first rohingya family since exodus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A Rohingya refugee carrying a child looks at the full moon at Balukhali refugee camp near Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, late last year. File photograph: Susana VeraReuters Myanmar on Saturday repatriated what it said was the first Rohingya family from nearly 700,000 refugees who had fled to Bangladesh, after months of fraught talks with Dhaka and amid United Nations warnings that the country is not ready for their return.Fleeing Rohingya refugees have reported killings, rape and arson on a large scale. The United States and UN have described the Myanmar military operation as ethnic cleansing.Myanmar has denied nearly all allegations, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The army has said its crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August.Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in January to complete a voluntary repatriation of the refugees in two years. Myanmar set up two reception centres and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals.“Five members of a Muslim family...came to the Taungpyoletwea reception centre in Rakhine state this morning,” the Myanmar government said in a statement late on Saturday.The family members were scrutinised by immigration and health ministry officials, and the social welfare, relief and resettlement ministry provided them with “materials such as rice, mosquito netting, blankets, T-shirt, longyis (Burmese sarong) and kitchen utensils”, said the government in the statement.It added that family members who “are in line with the rules” were issued with national verification cards (NVCs) upon entering Myanmar.NVCs are part of the government’s ongoing effort to register Rohingya which falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.Most Burmese consider the Rohingya as unwanted immigrants from Bangladesh, and the army refers to them as “Bengalis”.Last week, the most senior UN official to visit Myanmar this year, assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Ursula Mueller, said the conditions in Myanmar were not conducive to the return of the refugees.She cited a continued lack of access to health services, concerns among the Rohingya about protection, and continued displacements. She described conditions in camps for internally displaced people from previous bouts of violence as “deplorable”.Several boats with Rohingya people from parts of violence-torn Rakhine state have left Myanmar in recent months. The latest confirmed departure took place on Thursday. – ReutersThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462342.1523785025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"assad says syrian air strikes were act of aggression reports","story":"More chemical attacks in Syria will not be tolerated and the U.S. is prepared to strike again according to US Vice President Mike Pence, who added his voice to the chorus of warnings to Syria. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Syrian soldier films the damage of the Syrian Scientific Research Center which was targeted in air strikes. Photograph: Hassan AmmarAPSyrian president Bashar al-Assad told a group of Russian politicians on Sunday that Western missile strikes on his country were an act of aggression, Russian news agencies reported.Russian politicians met with Mr Assad after the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities, including a research and development centre in the Barzeh district of Damascus and two installations near Homs.The bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Mr Assad and his superpower ally Russia, but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Mr Assad or intervening in the civil war.Russian news agencies quoted politicians as saying Mr Assad was in a “good mood” and had praised the Soviet-era air defence systems used by Syria to help to repel the Western attacks.The supply of Russian air defence systems was not discussed, agencies reported, but Mr Assad accepted an invitation to visit the Siberian region of Khanty-Mansi in Russia. It was not clear when the visit would take place.US president Donald Trump called the operation a success, tweeting “Mission accomplished”.The US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that Trump told her that if Syria uses poisonous gas again, “The United States is locked and loaded.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes were “unacceptable and lawless.”Syrian state media called them a “flagrant violation of international law,” while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called it a crime and the Western leaders criminals.Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally, but the Pentagon said no Russian air defence systems were used. Syria fired 40 unguided surface-to-air missiles - but only after the Western strikes had ended, the Pentagon said.British prime minister Theresa May described the strike as “limited and targeted,” with no intention of toppling Assad or intervening more widely in the war.Ms May has faced a backlash from MPs, with Jeremy Corbyn calling for a war powers act to give parliament more scrutiny over military action.Appearing on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show, the Labour leader questioned the legal basis for the UK joining the US and France in air strikes in response to the chemical weapons attack in Douma.Mr Corbyn said Parliament should have been given a vote ahead of the strikes.“I think what we need in this country is something more robust like a War Powers Act so that governments do get held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.”The Labour leader warned of an escalation in a “proxy war” between the US and Russia. He said chlorine has been used by “a number of parties in the conflict” in Syria as a weapon.Mr Corbyn said that if Britain wants to “get the moral high ground around the world” it must abide by international law for taking military action.“Where is the legal basis for this?” he said.Foreign secretary Boris Johnson said “finally the world has said enough is enough” as he defended the “proportionate” action.“There is no proposal on the table at the moment for further attacks because so far — thank heavens — the Assad regime has not been so foolish to launch another chemical weapons attack.”Mr Johnson added: “If and when such a thing were to happen then clearly, with allies, we would study what the options were.”UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all Security Council members to exercise restraint and avoid escalation in Syria, but said allegations of chemical weapons use demand an investigation.In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull urged Russia to drop its “pretence” that Syria was not behind the chemical attack on Douma and use its influence to force the Assad government to destroy its chemical weapons.“Russia has used its position as a member of the United Nations Security Council to veto resolutions designed to ensure that this chemical weapons crime is thoroughly investigated and cannot be repeated,” he told a news conference on Sunday.Washington described the strike targets as a centre near Damascus for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post.The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets, and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria’s ability to produce such weapons.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict for years, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops on the ground to fight that group. But they have refrained from targeting Assad’s government, apart from a volley of US missiles last year.Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings.Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated to levels of Cold War-era hostility, has denied any gas attack took place in Douma and even accused Britain of staging it to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma. Damascus is still permitted to have chlorine for civilian use, although its use as a weapon is banned. Allegations of Assad’s chlorine use have been frequent during the war although, unlike nerve agents, chlorine did not produce mass casualties as seen last week.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Who will be Cuba\u0026#39s next president when Raul Castro steps down? Cuba prepares for life after the CastrosThe \u0026#39river guardians\u0026#39 fighting to clean up the world\u0026#39s most plastic-polluted waterway When Chess bombed on Broadway: \u0026#39It was one of the worst experiences of my life\u0026#39American soybean farmers prepare for hard times as Donald Trump’s trade war with China bitesNew satire offers Zimbabweans a chance to laugh at Robert Mugabe\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesSouth Africa\u0026#39s anti-apartheid heroine Winnie Mandela laid to restHigh-profile gay rights lawyer sets himself alight in New York park in suicide protest against fossil fuelsSyrian strikes help Emmanuel Macron cement position as key Trump ally ahead of Washington visitStop sharing NHS data with Home Office, officials told Humans to be genetically-modified in Europe for the first time this year using gene-splicing therapyLabour\u0026#39s \u0026#39unaffordable electoral bungs\u0026#39 could drive businesses out of Britain Theresa May announces £60 million fund to tackle scourge of  plastic in world\u0026#39s oceansLabour councillors standing for election pledge to help \u0026#39stop Brexit\u0026#39Donald Trump declares US \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 for more strikes on SyriaJudi Dench told by Cornish villagers to stop interfering in phone mast disputeBoom in cocaine demand fuels increase in strength putting more lives at riskRules for modern romance for the over 50s – you can kiss on a first dateWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"sir tim laurence shaking english heritage hardest part marrying","story":"Princess Anne and Sir Tim Lawrence marrying at Crathie Parish Church in 1992Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, husband of Princess Anne and son-in-law of the Queen, has driven alone in his Land Rover Discovery from Gatcombe Park, his Gloucestershire home, to the Shropshire town of Ironbridge.

I clearly declare that the president of the United States, the president of France and the British prime minister are criminals,\u0026quot Khamenei said in a speech, according to his Twitter account.\u0026quotThey will not benefit (from the attack) as they went to Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan in the past years and committed such crimes and did not gain any benefits,\u0026quot Khamenei said.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei poses for a portraitIran - the dominant Shi’ite Muslim power which is in rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the United States’ other Sunni Arab friends - has fought decades of sectarian proxy wars in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.Iran\u0027s pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani also warned that the U.S.-led missile attack on Syria would lead to further destruction in the Middle East, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.\u0026quotSuch attacks will have no result but more destruction ... the Americans want to justify their presence in the region by such attacks,\u0026quot Rouhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim.Rouhani signalled that Iran\u0027s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would grow.\u0026quotThe Syrian nation will continue to resist against foreign aggression ...Iran has always helped and will continue to support oppressed nations in the region and around the globe,\u0026quot Rouhani said.Iranian Defence Minister Hossein Dehghan said: \u0026quotThe Syrian people will certainly answer these attacks and the people of the world should condemn this aggression,\u0026quot Fars news agency reported.An official in Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the Islamic Republic\u0027s most powerful arm, said the fallout from the attacks will be at Washington\u0027s expense.Britain, the US and France on Friday night bombed Syria. Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian government\u0026quotWith this attack ... the situation will become more complex, and this will surely be at the expense of the United States, which will be responsible for the aftermath of upcoming regional events that will certainly not be in their interest,\u0026quot Yadollah Javani, the Guards\u0027 deputy head for political affairs, told Fars news agency.\u0026quotThe resistance front will be strengthened and it will have more capacity to act against (U.S.) acts of intervention. Americans should expect the consequences of their actions,\u0026quot Javani said.Iran often refers to regional countries and forces opposed to Israel and the United States as a \u0026quotresistance front\u0026quot.\u0026quotUndoubtedly, the United States and its allies, which took military action against Syria despite the absence of any proven evidence ... will assume responsibility for the regional and trans-regional consequences of this adventurism,\u0026quot Iran\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by state media.\u0026quotIran is opposed to the use of chemical weapons on the basis of religious, legal and ethical standards, while at the same time it ... strongly condemns (using this) as an excuse to commit aggression against a sovereign state,\u0026quot it said.Iran has been Assad\u0027s most supportive ally against insurgents throughout the conflict. Iran-backed militias helped his army stem rebel advances and, following Russia’s entry into the war in 2015, turn the tide decisively in Assad’s favour.Analyst Hossein Sheikholeslam, a former Iranian ambassador to Damascus, told state television the attacks would help unite Syrians behind the government.\u0026quotThese attacks will stabilise the Syrian government... and unite the different tribes in Syria as Syrians become aware of their honour and come to the defence of the independence, territorial integrity and the government of their country,\u0026quot Sheikholeslam said.Israel said in response to the American-led strike in Syria that the Middle Eastern country\u0027s \u0026quotmurderous actions\u0026quot had put it in danger.An official said in a statement that Mr Trump made clear last year that the use of chemical weapons was a red line not to be crossed.Damascus sky lights up with service to air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria, early Saturday, April 14, 2018He said the overnight operation carried out by the United States, France and Britain followed that example. The official said that \u0026quotSyria continues to carry out murderous actions and be a base for these actions and others, including Iran\u0027s, that put its territory, forces and leadership in peril.\u0026quotThe official spoke anonymously according to protocol. There has been no other official Israeli response yet.Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about Iran\u0027s increased involvement along its border in Syria in Lebanon.Air strikes carried out by the United States, France and Britain against Syrian military targets could give terrorism an opportunity to expand in the region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said on Saturday.The air strikes marked a \u0026quota very dangerous development\u0026quot, the ministry said in statement.\u0026quotSuch action could have dangerous consequences, threatening the security and stability of the region and giving terrorism another opportunity to expand after it was ousted from Iraq and forced into Syria to retreat to a large extent,\u0026quot it said.The ministry called on Arab leaders to discuss the situation at a summit due to be held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.Saudi Arabia has expressed its full support for US-led strikes on Syrian government military installations, saying they were a response to \u0026quotregime crimes\u0026quot against civilians.\u0026quotSaudi Arabia fully supports the strikes launched by the United States, France and Britain against Syria because they represent a response to the regime\u0027s crimes,\u0026quot a foreign ministry statement said.Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud meets with U.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump during a reception ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 20, 2017The statement, carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, said the strikes were prompted by the \u0026quotSyrian regime\u0027s use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians, including women and children\u0026quot.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have been key backers of Syrian opposition groups fighting Assad.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed Western strikes against Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime as \u0026quotappropriate\u0026quot in retaliation for Damascus\u0027 \u0026quotinhumane\u0026quot attacks.\u0026quotWe consider this operation as appropriate,\u0026quot Erdogan told a meeting of his ruling party in Istanbul.\u0026quotThe regime has seen that its mounting attacks in recent days against dissidents ... will not be left unanswered.\u0026quotChina said it was \u0026quotopposed to the use of force\u0026quot following US-led air strikes against Syria and called for a \u0026quotreturn to the framework of international law\u0026quot.\u0026quotWe consistently oppose the use of force in international relations, and advocate respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries,\u0026quot foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement on its website.Hua said unilateral military action bypassing the UN Security Council would \u0026quotadd new complicating factors to the resolution of the Syrian issue\u0026quot.Xi Jinping and Donald Trump\u0026quotChina believes that a political solution is the only realistic way out for the Syrian issue,\u0026quot she added.\u0026quotChina urges all the relevant parties to return to the framework of international law and to resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation.\u0026quotChina is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.Beijing has consistently said the Syrian crisis needs a \u0026quotpolitical solution\u0026quot but has numerous times vetoed Security Council measures aimed at addressing the conflict - including an investigation of war crimes in the country.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday the air strikes against the Syrian regime were \u0026quotnecessary and appropriate\u0026quot after the suspected chemical weapons attacks that killed dozens in Douma.\u0026quotWe support the fact that our US, British and French allies ... assumed their responsibilities. The military intervention was necessary and appropriate,\u0026quot Merkel said in a statement.\u0026quotEverything leads us to believe that (Assad) bears responsibility\u0026quot for the Douma attack, Merkel said.The chancellor on Thursday had ruled out Germany joining any military action against Syria.On Saturday she said it appeared likely that the Syrian regime \u0026quothad used chemical weapons against its own people on several occasions in the past\u0026quot.Merkel added: \u0026quotA century after the end of World War I... we must fight against the erosion of the (international) convention on chemical weapons\u0026quot.\u0026quotGermany will undertake, in a determined way, diplomatic efforts to support this,\u0026quot Merkel said.The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.European Council president Donald Tusk said the European Union would stand with its allies \u0026quoton the side of justice\u0026quot.\u0026quotStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia \u0026amp Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost,\u0026quot he wrote on Twitter.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU commission, said the use of chemical weapons was \u0026quotunacceptable in any circumstances\u0026quot:Boris Johnson will meet with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday at a meeting to dominated by the strikes on Syria, James Crisp reports from Brussels. Through the weekend, British diplomats and ministers will be in touch with their EU counterparts to lay the groundwork for discussion over Friday night\u0027s air strikes. EU Ministers are expected to back language condemning the use of chemical weapons in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council. Before the joint US-UK and French attack, London and Paris was pushing to toughen up the language of the draft joint statement, which will decry the use of chemical weapons and the greying of the international line against their use. Those efforts are continuing. The debate among ministers will include discussion over the strike but also how to prevent the use of chemical weapons in the future and secure a ceasefire in Syria. Mr Johnson can expect support from other EU member states such as Belgium and the Netherlands. The meeting was always going to be important for Britain as it is the first Foreign Affairs Council after Theresa May secured EU support for condemning Russia for the Salisbury attack.The Telegraph understands the conclusions will take a tougher line on Russia and Iran than the statement agreed by EU leaders on March 21. This will not include sanctions at this stage but there is likely to be language stating that option remains on the table. Indonesia expressed concern over the airstrikes while strongly condemning the use of chemical weapons that caused the loss of many innocent lives, Nicola Smith reports.“Indonesia is concerned about unilateral actions by any parties, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, in response to the chemical weapons attack tragedy in Syria,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir said.Jakarta argued that taking military actions without prior authorisation from the UN Security Council was not in line with international legal principles in the peaceful settlement of disputes.The country further requests the UN Security Council take immediate steps to resolve the crisis in Syria, reported the Jakarta Post.“For Indonesia, peace and stability in Syria can only be achieved through dialogue and an inclusive political process,” said Mr Arrmanatha.Meanwhile, the Philippine foreign ministry advised all its citizens in Syria to remain in their homes until further notice, said spokesman Elmer Cato.Cato said the Philippine charge d’affaires in Syria, Crescente Relacion, had “described the more or less one hour missile barrage” as “like New Year in Manila.”Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”Please review our commenting policyWho will be Cuba\u0026#39s next president when Raul Castro steps down? Cuba prepares for life after the CastrosWhen Chess bombed on Broadway: \u0026#39It was one of the worst experiences of my life\u0026#39The \u0026#39river guardians\u0026#39 fighting to clean up the world\u0026#39s most plastic-polluted waterway American soybean farmers prepare for hard times as Donald Trump’s trade war with China bitesNew satire offers Zimbabweans a chance to laugh at Robert MugabeSouth Africa\u0026#39s anti-apartheid heroine Winnie Mandela laid to restHigh-profile gay rights lawyer sets himself alight in New York park in suicide protest against fossil fuelsSyrian strikes help Emmanuel Macron cement position as key Trump ally ahead of Washington visitStop sharing NHS data with Home Office, officials told Humans to be genetically-modified in Europe for the first time this year using gene-splicing therapyLabour\u0026#39s \u0026#39unaffordable electoral bungs\u0026#39 could drive businesses out of Britain Theresa May announces £60 million fund to tackle scourge of  plastic in world\u0026#39s oceansLabour councillors standing for election pledge to help \u0026#39stop Brexit\u0026#39Donald Trump declares US \u0026#39locked and loaded\u0026#39 for more strikes on SyriaProtect our salmon from poachers, volunteers demand as they say river deserves funding as it beats 58 others for yields Rules for modern romance for the over 50s – you can kiss on a first dateBoom in cocaine demand fuels increase in strength putting more lives at riskOrphaned fox cubs advertised for £120 each on Facebook as charities warn of wild animals being sold onlineWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"woke missiles streaking damascus night sky","story":"This wasn’t the usual sound of light artillery shelling against remaining rebel enclaves in Damascus which you normally hear.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yes, that’s about where we are.“The government is listening on the important aspects of the bill and I think that’s what the overall tone of the debate from the crossbenchers will be – that, actually, the government is listening and taking appropriate action.“But there was always going to be a time when this type of amendment, the customs union amendment, was going to cause a bit of a clash. We’ll just have to see how the debate goes.”In advance of Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan has tabled a small number of government amendments in response to earlier debates, but Tory insiders have been at pains to underline how they are technical in nature and do not “compromise” on the major principles of the Bill, with Conservative right-wingers keeping a close eye on proceedings.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She looks at me like I’m making a big mistake – she would turn out to be right.Getting to France from Brussels to cover the rail strikes that are paralysing the country is proving rather difficult. It’s normally a breezy half an hour to Lille on a high speed TGV from The Independent’s bureau in the Belgian capital, but those few services that are still running were booked up weeks in advance. I had managed to snag a ticket on the Eurostar, but that was then cancelled too, so decide to do the entire journey by slow Belgian suburban services – which aren’t on strike despite sometimes venturing over the border into France. It would take a while, but get me there eventually, or so I thought.Eurostar cancels trains as Macron protests erupt across ParisAn hour into my journey my optimism is shattered when a smartly uniformed train guard taps me on the shoulder. “Lille?” he asks. I nod, and he explains that the connecting Belgian service I was planning to take is now cancelled and I’ll have an extra hour’s wait at Tournai, the border city where I was planning to sneak into France.I do my time at Tournai’s ornate station alongside a gaggle of other fools braving the industrial dispute, and my train to France finally pulls in. But before it has ground to a halt, déjà vu strikes. “Lille?” I turn around, and another guard is standing there. I nod, like last time. “There is no Lille… they are blocking the way.” It turns out the French rail workers have anticipated my crafty workaround and, as well as stopping French services, have now physically blockaded the tracks to prevent Belgian trains getting anywhere near France as well. Of the dozen other travellers I am standing with, one looks distraught – but most shrug and accept that this is the way of things. “It’s a strike,” one man tells me. “It’s how it goes.” My train sits empty in the station, and will go no further.British commuters may think they know about rail strikes, but the French do them properly. Workers are walking off the job for 36 days scattered throughout April, May and June, with as many as four stoppages at week. France has invested heavily in its high speed rail network since the 1970s, and the country now relies on TGV services to get things done. Why is France\u0027s transport network mired in strikes?Air France strikes see a third of flights cancelledFrance strikes: another disrupted weekend for air and rail passengersFrance to cut number of MPs by almost a thirdWhen those trains don’t work, neither does the country. About 40 per cent of rail workers have participated in the strikes so far, and SNCF, the French national railway company, says it is running just one in three services and is urging passengers to stay away. Some cities also have separate strikes on their local bus and metro systems, with workers in, for example, Rouen taking 55 minutes out a day until late April – just enough to mess up timetables. You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but in France only around 8 per cent of workers are union members – far fewer than even in Britain, where about 25 per cent of employees pay dues. But despite the low membership across the economy, unionised workers are highly concentrated and more prepared to take direct action – like blockading international railway tracks.The reason behind the national rail strike is Emmanuel Macron’s plans to cut conditions for workers on the French railways. The government wants to end guaranteed job security and early pensions for SNCF employees, and says the move to cut workers’ compensation is the only way to reduce the €47bn in legacy debt the national rail company has on its books. But the industrial dispute has taken on wider political connotations, and has turned into a key test for Macron’s liberalising economic agenda – with comparisons inevitably drawn to Margaret Thatcher and the miners\u0027 strike.  Emmanuel Macron is not popular – but appears to have public backing on his changes to SNCF (Etienne LaurentPool Photo via AP)The French president made his first major statement on the strike in a television interview on Thursday, pledging that he would not back down. “We must go to the end, because we have to make this reform. It is indispensable. It would be hypocritical not to do it we need a strong French railway,” he told TF1. “The reform requires a little effort from everyone. Users have made efforts, prices have increased. We ask the company, SNCF, that it must reorganise.”But union leaders have taken an equally tough stance. “We\u0027re going to have a marathon if the government forces it,” Laurent Brun of the CGT rail union said on Friday after two days of talks with government negotiators. He hinted that the strike could be extended beyond its scheduled end on 28 June if the government did not back down or make concessions.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesThe wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.

But the dispute is polarising the French public, with unions pointing to a €460,000 strike fund gathered from 14,000 donors to replace wages lost during the strike.Despite apparently having the public on his side, Emmanuel Macron’s personal popularity has not yet benefited. Still the most unpopular French president in recent history, Mr Macron saw an 11 per cent slide in his approval rating at the start of the strike, wiping out a bounce at the start of the year.I never did manage to get into France, despite a close and futile study of local bus timetables. Whatever one thinks of the stoppages, in an age of crippled trade unions and declining workers’ power, French railway employees still have the power to bring their country to a standstill, and are not afraid to use it.
