But the long term implications of the condition are not yet fully understood. Whereas, the risk of being admitted to ICU with Covid in healthy teens is around one in 500,000.Data from the ONS report also confirmed that the vaccines are less likely to stop an infection now than when the Alpha variant was dominant, between December 2020 and May this year.At that time, double-vaccination cut the risk of testing positive for the virus by 79 per cent. For comparison, among those who had beat Alpha, the risk was reduced by 65 per cent.Sarah Crofts, the head of analysis for the Covid infection survey, said in a blog post that the drop in vaccine protection between the two recording periods was likely down to waning of vaccine immunity.She said: \u0027The most recent data... includes results from participants who had experienced a longer average time period since their second Covid vaccination.\u0027If there is any change in vaccine effectiveness over time (such as vaccines wearing off) then it is more likely to have been identified in the latest analysis.\u0027She added that small sample sizes may also have influenced the figures.There were just 99 people in the group who had recovered from the virus between May and August, compared to almost 4,000 among the double-jabbed. To be counted as recovered from the virus, someone had to have not received a single dose of the Covid vaccine.\u0027Additionally, when we estimate the risk of infection among vaccinated people compared to unvaccinated people, we need test results from each group of people.\u0027Over time, more people have received vaccinations and so there are smaller numbers of unvaccinated people to compare with.\u0027Department of Health data suggests some 45.3million people — or more than nine in ten adults — have already received two doses of the Covid vaccine.And almost half of over-50s had got their third booster dose by mid-September, data showed, about a month after they were offered to the age group.Some 3.1million had already received this shot by Sept 16, out of the estimated 6.5million who are eligible. The true extent of immunity against the coronavirus remains unknown. It has been made more difficult to untangle by a series of conflicting studies. A study in Israel published last month found that unvaccinated people with natural immunity were 13 times less likely to catch Covid than double-jabbed people who had never been exposed to the virus before.However, experts at King\u0027s College London found that people with two vaccines enjoy up to 80 per cent protection against infection compared to just 65 per cent in the natural immunity group."},{"url":null,"title":"Ashleigh Banfield dismisses Katie Courics flimsy denial iced NewsNation anchor","story":"Share this articleFrom Cable Star to Face in the Crowd - The New York TimesKatie Couric Talks Ashleigh Banfield, Feeling \u0027Protective of My Position\u0027 | PEOPLE.com"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea987f5c651ffaa84b505d991d54496d12a50bc/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b06eaa22fab0b3b0a1122274a73b571d","title":"arsenal v crystal palace premier league live","story":"Yes, I feel you – I was an idiot at 20 without the aggravating factors of talent and money – but the basic feeling of competing with your mates and wanting to win makes the majority of players do whatever it takes.

Latvia is world number 1 in infections rate”, health minister Daniels Pavluts told reporters on Monday evening after an emergency meeting by the government. He added that the lockdown would then only be eased for the vaccinated. Prime minister Krisjanis Karins blamed low vaccination rates. The country currently has the highest rate of new Covid cases in the world, according to the US Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC). That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. Goodbye. Keep following for all the latest Covid news.It is the latest step in the East African nation’s shift towards a more active approach to containing the pandemic. The vaccination campaign started in the commercial capital of Bujumbura without fanfare. Dozens of city residents queued quietly at a vaccination site, telling Reuters they heard about the drive through word of mouth. No government officials were present to officially inaugurate the launch. “I rushed to take the vaccine because I have a trip very soon and, of course, I also want to protect myself,” said 30-year-old Blaise, who asked to only use his first name. “People’s fears are groundless. I am reassured by the fact that I was with a doctor when I got it.” The jabs administered Monday were part of a Chinese donation of 500,000 Sinopharm doses.The curfew, running from 11pm to 5am was in effect in 23 out of 58 provinces in the North African country. Gatherings, weddings, and social events are still under a ban, the statement said.Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have been 163,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. As of 9am on Monday, there had been a further 49,156 lab-confirmed Covid cases in the UK, the government said. Prof Hayward, a member of the Sage scientific advisory panel, told BBC Radio 4’s World At One:  He said waning immunity is “probably part of” the reason infections are currently high, adding there is “some evidence” protection against infection is beginning to wear off and “probably some evidence” protection against severe disease is waning to a lesser extent. It means the death toll under this daily measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - remains at 8,930. However the Scottish Government noted that register offices are generally closed at weekends. The figures compared to 45,140 cases and 57 deaths reported a day earlier. Five counties all located in northern Slovakia are affected by the measures, which include the closures of restaurants with people only allowed to buy meals at takeout windows, Reuters reported. Fitness and wellness centres also have been closed. The number of people allowed to attend public gatherings is reduced to 100 fully vaccinated people. It’s also mandatory to wear face coverings both outdoors and indoors. The number of infected in those counties is higher than 400 per 100,000 people in the last seven days. Slovakia is facing a new wave of infections, with daily numbers in the country reaching 2,406 on Tuesday, the highest number since the middle of March.Italy has registered 131,585 deaths linked to Covid since the outbreak in February last year. It has the second highest toll in Europe behind Britain, and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 4.7 million cases to date. The number of patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 2,428 on Monday, up from 2,386 a day earlier.The analysis, carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), is based on NHS test and trace data as well as ONS survey results for the period between 17 May to 14 August, when the Delta variant was dominant. The results reveal that those who had received two doses of the Covid jabs at least 14 days before the period of interest had a lower risk of testing positive during that time than those who had only had one dose at least 21 days before.  However, two doses of either jab offered a similar level of protection as that provided by a natural infection.  While the two types of vaccine appear to offer different levels of protection, the team urge caution, noting the jabs were given to different age groups and had different follow-up times.It is understood that Nimco Ali, a campaigner and Home Office adviser who is godmother to the Johnsons’ infant son, Wilfred, was at Downing Street over the Christmas period as part of their childcare support bubble. The prime minister’s official spokesperson declined to formally confirm that Ali was there. “As you might expect, I’m not going to get into speaking about iniduals that the prime minister has seen over Christmas,” he said. “What I can say is that the prime minister and Mrs Johnson have followed the coronavirus rules at all times.” However, the spokesperson did say that neither Boris Johnson’s mother – who died last month aged 79 – or Carrie Johnson’s mother were with the family over Christmas. Asked to confirm whether or not Ali was there, he did not respond. “It is entirely accurate to say that they followed coronavirus rules at all times,” the spokesperson said, rejecting the argument that it was legitimate to seek clear answers on the arrangements given lockdown breaches by senior government figures such as Johnson’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings and the ex-health secretary Matt Hancock. “I don’t accept that,” he said. “We have been very clear that throughout this pandemic the prime minister has expected all ministers to adhere to the guidelines. That is what the prime minister and Mrs Johnson have done, both at this time and throughout, and I’m happy to make that clear.” Downing Street said an increase in coronavirus cases had been expected over the winter and the government would keep a “close watch” on the situation, PA Media reported. Epidemiologist and government adviser Prof Andrew Hayward said the situation was “concerning” and there was “huge potential for the NHS to come under a lot of pressure”. The spokesman said the success of the vaccines meant “we are able to be one of the most open economies in Europe, which is benefiting the public and indeed businesses as well”.Victoria police on Monday confirmed 34 police officers and nine protective services officers had not complied with the vaccination order by the state’s chief health officer and by a specific chief commissioner instruction. Exemptions from having the mandatory vaccine only apply if an employee is unable to be vaccinated due to a medical issue, the force said. Those refusing the jab have been referred to Professional Standards Command for failing to abide by an instruction of the chief commissioner and face subsequent disciplinary action, which may result in their sacking. They have been stood down and directed to take accrued leave. The Police Association backs mandatory vaccinations and has been contacted for comment. Without WHO’s approval the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid Covid vaccine around the world. Bharat Biotech has been pursuing a WHO emergency-use listing for several months, having submitted data on a rolling basis since July. “We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for (Bharat Biotech’s) Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners,” WHO said on Twitter. Bharat Biotech did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Covaxin is one of the three approved vaccines that have been used in India for the country’s vaccination drive for adults.  South Africa has one of the world’s highest HIV burdens, and some studies have suggested that administration of vaccines using the Adenovirus Type 5 (Ad5) vector - which Sputnik V does – can lead to higher susceptibility to HIV in men. Viral vector vaccines such as Sputnik V use modified viruses as vehicles, or vectors, to carry genetic information that helps the body build immunity against future infections, Reuters reported. SAHPRA, the regulator, said it had asked for data demonstrating Sputnik V was safe in settings with high HIV prevalence, but that it had not received enough to establish this. “SAHPRA resolved that the … (emergency) application for Sputnik V … not be approved at this time. SAHPRA is concerned that use of the Sputnik V vaccine in … a setting of a high HIV prevalence and incidence may increase the risk of vaccinated males acquiring HIV,” the statement read. The Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, said: “Concerns about the safety of Ad5-vectored vaccines in populations at risk for HIV infection are completely unfounded,” adding that SAHPRA would get all the information it needed. More than 250 clinical trials and 75 international publications confirm the safety of vaccines and medicines based on human adenovirus vectors, the institute added.School leaders’ unions are concerned that 12- to 15-year-olds in England are missing out on getting a Covid vaccination in school due to a high level of cases among the cohort, as well as logistical problems with vaccination teams having insufficient staff to deal with students needing jabs. Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first dose of the Covid vaccine as part of a rollout that began a month ago.

Photograph: Maura HickeyOne of the country’s teacher unions has called for the immediate reintroduction of Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in primary schools due to the rising number of infections.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) also wants a pilot scheme for antigen testing to begin in schools and an urgent review on restricting the use of face coverings to children aged 13 and over.The call came after a primary school in Co Wexford said it was sending children home until after the midterm break after 34 students tested positive for the virus.Vicky Barron, the principal of CBS Primary School in Wexford Town, said there were “serious flaws” in HSE guidance for schools and the decision not to contact trace for cases in classes.In a message on Sunday evening, Ms Barron told parents of pupils that the board of management had decided to send children home to be taught remotely this week because of the volume of cases in the school. A positive case of Covid-19 was detected in one class on October 8th and a number of other cases were notified over the following days.The HSE deemed all children in the class to be close contacts and sent them for testing on October 12th but their siblings were told to continue attending school. The number of cases has since risen to 34 including a number of siblings of the class members.The INTO questioned the premature cessation of public health risk assessments and the testing and contact tracing in primary schools from September 27th.“This change in policy last month, which was challenged by this union, was informed by a view at the time that further relaxation of public-health measures was on the cards,” it said.This was “now far from clear” with the State’s deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn and other leading public health experts “openly raising alarm in recent days,” the INTO said.It wants current infection and prevent control measures, including the use of pods and bubbles and the wearing of face masks by staff remaining in place beyond October 31st. The union said that a pilot scheme for antigen testing in schools was recommended by an expert review group and should be commenced immediate.“In light of the worrying public-health indicators, we must use every tool at our disposal to protect our school communities,” the union said.The HSE has repeatedly said primary schools remain a low-risk setting for the transmission of Covid-19 and that asymptomatic children do not contribute to the spread of the virus. While the policy of not testing and contact tracing close contacts of cases has been in place since last month, the HSE carries out a public health risk assessment on inidual classes and, if merited, will direct a classroom of students to be sent for testing. The HSE continues to direct parents to keep children displaying symptoms home from school.The INTO urged the Government to start a public awareness campaign to ensure that those with Covid-19 symptoms do not attend school.“There is anecdotal evidence from members on the ground that symptomatic children continue to attend schools,” the union said.Asked if it would seek the reopening of CBS primary school on the basis that public health advice was not followed in the decision to close the school for remote teaching, the Department of Education said that it did not comment on inidual cases. The department said if there were outbreaks of concern in schools, public health teams would continue to provide support and testing will remain available should it be required. It advises any students with symptoms not to attend school."},{"url":null,"title":"universities call for leaving cert results to be given in june","story":"The Irish Universities Association – which represents eight of the largest universities – is also calling for an immediate end to ‘distorting’ grade inflation and a return to normal grades patterns. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienUniversities say timelines for the release of Leaving Cert results are “no longer fit for purpose” and want students to be issued their grades at the end of June, followed by college offers in July.The Irish Universities Association – which represents eight of the largest universities – is also calling for an immediate end to “distorting” grade inflation and a return to normal grades patterns.The association’s director general Jim Miley made the points in a submission ahead of an Oireachtas education committee meeting on Tuesday which is due to debate Leaving Cert reform.On the issue of the CAO system which has come in for criticism recently, Mr Miley said it was designed on the basis of stable grades but recent grade inflation had “destabilised” results trends.In 2019, he said, just over 200 students achieved a maximum score of six H1 grades. This year, this had grown to 1,342, an increase of more than 600 per cent.“This has distorted the entry threshold to third level with a particular inequity to applicants presenting results from earlier years,” he said.Universities are proposing that the system reverts immediately to a stable grade distribution model in line with pre-Covid trends.This would ensure Leaving Cert results “continue to serve as the mainstream selection mechanism for entry into Irish higher education”.In relation to the timing of results, he said the traditional release of grades in mid-August was posing problems for students and the wider system.Students and their families have a very short timeframe to find student accommodation, he said, while it is also out of line with European countries such as the UK who issued results earlier.For example, a student who has applied for a course in both an Irish university and in the UK may feel compelled to accept the latter for fear of not getting a place in the State.Mr Miley said universities are now firmly of the view that these timelines are no longer fit for purpose.“We propose that students should be in possession of their Leaving Cert results no later than the end of June of any given year. This would allow the CAO to process these results and for offers and acceptances to higher education to be completed before the end of July,” he said.“The delivery of results within this revised timeline is entirely feasible with less emphasis on the final examination, and a greater emphasis on a range of continuous assessment options.“The IUA proposes that immediate steps are taken to introduce this revised timeline in 2022.”In a submission to the committee, Mr Miley said that while the Leaving Cert has many positive attributes, the “heavy-weighting” of the final written exams is “far too great” and discriminates against some students with additional needs.Instead, the association wants “authentic assessment” across all subjects over a three-year period that “genuinely reflects” the learning and thinking of the student."},{"url":null,"title":"how portlaoise went from litter blackspot to cleanest town","story":" Vincent Booth, secretary Tidy Towns, Mark Healy, Downtown Portlaoise, Gerry Browne, chairman Tidy Towns and Alison Browne, president Laois Chamber of Commerce at Fitzmaurice Place, Portlaoise.Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Being rock bottom of the Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) league 10 years ago was the incentive for a erse range of business and community groups in Portlaoise to join forces to create a Town Team.This week the Laois town topped the IBAL rankings which was based on a survey carried out by An Taisce which praised Portlaoise for “years of concerted effort and steady improvement”.Husband and wife team Gerry and Alison Browne are the chairs respectively of the Portlaoise Tidy Town Committee and Laois Chamber of Commerce, they are also members of the Town Team.The dismal ranking 10 years ago was the main driver for getting all the organisations and community groups working together, says Alison Browne. “Being bottom of the league was a huge incentive for us, because we believe Portlaoise is the reception desk for the rest of the county. It was the main driver for getting all communities working together to start building a community spirit that I don’t believe was there before.“It definitely was the catalyst to get us where we are today.”Another Town Team member, Mark Healy said that in the 13 years since the Downtown Traders Association was set up there have been great efforts to revive the town centre and “to create an environment that supported the businesses in the town and to make it more appealing to passersby, to new businesses looking to set up.“The presentation of the town was a huge part of attracting people to the town, Portlaoise Tidy Towns have been very active in that and Downtown Portlaoise, the Chamber and Laois Co Council have given every support they can over the last 10 years to support the town,” he adds.Alison Browne points out that sometimes it is the simplest of measures that work the best. Every local business is encouraged to clean outside their own shopfront. “That could be a couple of times a day, you could just clean it and someone would drop litter again — so it’s the community that is staying on top of litter 247.”“From our point of view it’s having a scheme in place to keep the town tidy and the business community mixes in with the Tidy Towns and everyone cleans outside their own shopfront.“I also think building the relationship with the Council has been fantastic. In the olden days Tidy Towns and traders used to fight with the Council, but our groups don’t see it that way, we feel working together through the fantastic Town Team has been hugely successful because somebody from every group is on the town team so there’s joined up thinking and we feel that has been a vital lifeline for Portlaoise and has benefitted Tidy Towns groups across Laois who are growing in strength.“We feel that having a clean town is going to entice, grow and attract businesses into Portlaoise and Laois. Now is the time because we’ve shown that we’re a great community working together. Also we’re a very erse and inclusive society, we’ve more nationalities here in Laois than anywhere else in Ireland. We’re very welcoming as a county.”Mark Healy explains that the Town Team has been very active in bringing the erse groups together. “It contains representatives from Laois Co Council - officials and elected members, members of Downtown Portlaoise, Laois Chamber of Commerce, Laois Tidy Towns, Age Action, arts and heritage groups. It’s an actual team that meets frequently and then the work is broken down into segments — there might be a marketing committee, town development committee, an arts committee — everybody pulls together to focus on inidual areas.”All the members of the Town Team pay tribute to two deceased local representatives Kathleen O’Brien and Jerry Lodge, who were the original founders. “They set it up, they were the driving force — they put in a huge body of work, it’s a credit and a tribute to them.”Laois County Manager John Mulholland is also praised for his support which the Team says enables them to focus on the voluntary aspect of the project.“Instead of going to the council and giving out, now it’s everyone working together,” says Alison Browne.“It really feels like everybody is working together now, and everybody knows what each committee is doing so there’s no ‘us and them’, it’s really just us throughout the town. That’s a very pleasant change and move we’ve noticed,” adds Healy.Ms Browne also feels that the pandemic has had an impact as it led people to focus on what was important in the community. “It’s one of the few ups from Covid.” There is a social aspect, with volunteers going for coffee after their shift which is good for wellbeing, she says.For Tidy Towns chairman Gerry Browne learning that Portlaoise was bottom of the IBAL league 10 years ago led him to join the local Tidy Town committee. “Hearing that was like a kick in the stomach and that energised me. It was a case of either do something about it or not, so I decided I would do something about it.”Finding volunteers has not always been easy, he admits, but his philosophy is not to ask people but to encourage them. “To ask somebody to go out and pick up someone else’s rubbish — it takes a special kind of person to do that. I think we’re dead lucky with the people who have come forward, people come to us, we’ve learned that you don’t ask somebody to volunteer, if they come to you they come for their own reasons, they want to do it.“There’s no point in trying to get somebody to do it. We’re so lucky with the volunteers we have. I think we’ve had a great crew for a good few years, even before Covid, it’s only through Covid that we realise how committed they actually were. Even during Covid, we would go out and do our litter picks (socially distanced), on Wednesday and Saturday, they kept the whole thing going.”Tidy Towns Portlaoise secretary Vincent Booth who works for the HSE in the area of mental health tells of the importance of the work to the people with whom he works. “We have had some of the lads out on occasion. To feel part of the community is immense for them.It’s great to involve people who may be on the fringes, we’re open to all people, we’re non discriminatory – that’s the good thing about Tidy Towns, it’s open to everybody of every background.”Gerry Browne adds: “We’re part of the restorative justice programme as well - we get people from the courts that help us which is of great benefit to them and to us. Generally it’s a positive thing.”The Tidy Town group also works closely with local schools which they say pays great idends.There are also bioersity plans for the town. “Great things are going to happen,” says Booth."},{"url":null,"title":"adam terry 10 given provisional date for scoliosis surgery","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin described the delay of several years in the case a ‘systems failure’ in the health service.

If there happened to be an emergency on the day, such as a child involved in a traffic collision, the procedure would be cancelled, she said.Speaking about the pain her son was in due to his condition,she said his case was “an emergency”.“I’m now dealing with a little boy who is in so much pain daily, he is in bed all day, he can’t get up, he can’t function. He was screaming in pain and that was really really hard,” she said.Adam’s father Mark said there were clear “bottlenecks” in the system that “need to be ironed out”.The issue of children with scoliosis facing long delays waiting for surgery was “going on years,” he said. “Whatever is broken in the system, someone needs to come in and fix it,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"man says he was asked to pay 75 monthly pet rent at dublin apartment","story":"Roy Ferris viewed an apartment with his partner at the Griffith Wood development on Griffith Avenue in Marino and was told he would have to pay €75 to keep his cats Iris and Isaac there per month. Photograph: Mario GutiGetty ImagesA pet owner has said he was asked to pay €75 per month in “pet rent” to keep his two cats in a new rental development in north Dublin. Roy Ferris viewed an apartment with his partner at the weekend at the Griffith Wood development on Griffith Avenue in Marino and was told he would have to pay €75 to keep his cats Iris and Isaac there per month. This fee was in addition to rents which start at €2,250 per month and parking fees of €100. “I registered my interest and a lady got back to me and said ‘we’re having viewings, would you like to come along?’ and I said yes and she said ‘do you have any pets?’ and I said yes I have two cats but nothing was mentioned. The advertisement had said it was pet friendly. He said there was a pet bed for a dog or cat in the apartment and when his partner asked about keeping them she was told they would have to pay a fee. Mr Ferris said he has been renting for the last 10 years in Ireland and had never heard of “pet rent”. “They called it pet rent,”he said. Mr Ferris said he was “ a bit knocked back” and would not have bothered viewing if he had known about the pet rent. Greystar, the real estate developer which purchased more than 300 homes on the Griffith Wood scheme said: “While many rental properties do not allow pets or limit them to certain sections, Greystar is pet friendly and allow residents to keep their animals in their homes. Monthly fees or deposits are the norm for modern developments which permit pets and we charge a monthly fee for pets such as cats or dogs which roam freely in apartments.”“The total monthly fee of €75, which is for one or more pets, is to cover soiling and additional wear and tear caused by the pets. There is no fee for pets which remain contained such as gerbils, hamsters, birds etc.”The Labour Party has called for a blanket ban on pet rent. Labour Senator and housing spokeswoman Rebecca Moynihan said the practice must be stamped out.“Pets play a huge role in many people’s lives. They provide companionship and emotional support, enhancing overall wellbeing.

It means 4.8 million are in danger from waning immunity.Currently, people eligible for a third dose must wait until they are contacted by the NHS before booking a jab.John Roberts, of the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, who calculated the figures based on the latest NHS England booster figures and historical vaccination data, said: At the start of the booster campaign, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care stated that the aim was to protect the most vulnerable from Covid-19 as we head into the autumn and winter months.But at the current rate, it\u0027s likely to be towards the end of January before the approximately 22 million that fall into the most vulnerable groups receive the booster.With case numbers very high and still rising, and admissions to hospital also rising again, it\u0027s clear that accelerating the booster rollout is vital to reduce the pressure on health services and minimise Covid-related deaths this autumn and winter.Experts blamed the slowdown on the growing complexity of the Covid vaccination programme, which is now dealing with schoolchildren, extra doses for immunocompromised people and rolling out the flu jab.At the peak of England\u0027s vaccine rollout, more than 500,000 doses were being given a day – but just 99,000 booster shots were reported in England on Monday, and the current daily average for other jabs has fallen to around 50,000.The booster programme is working its way through nine priority groups, starting with the over-80s, care home residents, frontline health workers and the clinically vulnerable.The Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group warned that there are two million people becoming eligible each week but just 1.3 million weekly jabs being carried out, meaning the backlog is growing. The gap between a second jab and booster is concerning, because studies have shown that immunity continues to drop over time.Data from Public Health England (PHE) found that AstraZeneca effectiveness against symptomatic Covid fell from 67 per cent to 47 per cent after 20 weeks, while protection from severe disease and hospital admissions dropped from 95 per cent to 77 per cent over the same period.Britain recorded 49,156 new Covid cases on Monday – a rise of 16 per cent in a week – meaning infections are rising as immunity in the most vulnerable is falling.Prof Andrew Hayward, an epidemiologist and government adviser of University College London,  said the situation was concerning and there was huge potential for the NHS to come under a lot of pressure.He said waning immunity was probably part of the reason infections are currently high, adding here was some evidence that protection against infection is beginning to wear off and probably some evidence that protection against severe disease is waning to a lesser extent.There were more than 1,400 Covid-related deaths among the over-80s in the past four weeks. Of the 2.2 million people over 80 who are eligible for a booster, fewer than 1.2 million have had the jab.Prof Hayward added: We need to get the vaccination rates up and we need to be prepared potentially to think about other measures if things do get out of control.Downing Street said the NHS was doing everything possible to contact people eligible for a third jab or booster shot.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman said: We will continue to step up our communications to those who are eligible so they can come forward and get the protection they need.Prof Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the rollout was growing more complex.The programme has got much more complicated than it was before, he said. Previously, it was a straightforward matter of opening large centres and getting people in by age groups.Now we have multiple different groups being offered vaccines. They are really difficult patients to identify and to sculpt the programme. High risk groups are very difficult to reach.NHS England said its calculations showed that six million people were currently eligible for a booster and 4.2 million had already been invited for the jab. It said it did not recognise Roberts\u0027 figures and its own were based on NHS Digital records.An NHS spokesman said: Actually, the NHS has delivered more than three million boosters in less than a month and at a faster rate than in December 2020.While the NHS continues to deliver first and second doses as well as rolling out the vaccine in schools, millions of people are being invited at least six months on from their second jab which is in line with independent guidance. More from NewsThe EU is an obsolete empire that has condemned itself to irrelevanceGPs told not to engage with Government plan to increase face-to-face appointmentsBritish soldier died after elephant threw him 20ft into air on its tusks, inquest hearsTory MP calls for ‘David’s Law’ to get tough on online trolls in wake of fatal attackSpanish PM calls for king to be stripped of immunityUS can\u0026#39t defend against new Chinese hypersonic missiles, official warnsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine abandoned uk government found effective astrazeneca","story":"A Covid vaccine which the Government cancelled a contract for last month may be better and more effective than the AstraZeneca jab, according to new data.Valneva said on Monday that its phase three results – which included more than 4,000 people across 26 sites in the UK – show it produces roughly 40 per cent more neutralising antibodies than the OxfordAstraZeneca jab.Valneva, a French pharmaceutical company, has been developing and testing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 which uses a traditional method: inactivating the entire coronavirus and then injecting people with the inactive strain.The pathogen is made harmless but retains its shape and the body’s immune system recognises the invader and produces antibodies to fight it off.Boris Johnson visited Valneva’s Scottish manufacturing site in Livingston in January and the UK had ordered around 100 million doses of the vaccine.However, last month the Government cancelled the contract, citing a breach of contract from Valneva related to the supply agreement.In the new study, almost 2,000 participants over the age of 30 were given two doses – four weeks apart – of the Valneva jab, and then compared to 995 people who were given AstraZeneca. A further 1,040 people under 30 were given Valneva only.All analysis of antibody levels was done at Public Health England laboratories and the number of Covid-19 cases were similar between those given AstraZeneca or Valneva, the firm said, while there were no severe cases of disease.The company also said its vaccine, dubbed VLA2001, induced broad T-cell responses, a part of the immune system believed to be involved in long-term immunity.There is as yet no further explanation or clarification from the Department of Health as to why the Valneva contract was terminated.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, and Nadhim Zahawi, who was then Vaccines Minister, both said last month that it is a commercially sensitive problem.Mr Javid, speaking in the House of Commons, added: “It was also clear to us that the vaccine in question that the company was developing would not get approval by the MHRA here in the UK.”However, Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) and lead investigator of the Valneva trial, said the reason for these comments remains a mystery.“We don’t really know why he said that. It has been corrected in Hansards, so he has acknowledged that he got it wrong, but he hasn\u0027t actually explained, to me at least, exactly what led to that comment.“Certainly, the data that we have presented today are as good as we could have hoped for.“I think we are cautiously optimistic that we will indeed achieve authorisation for this vaccine based on these data.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “We have received the latest interim clinical trial data from Valneva for its Covid-19 vaccines.“The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will review the results once it receives the full data from Valneva, as part of the usual regulatory decision-making process.“The UK’s vaccination programme continues to be a success with over 80 per cent of the UK population double jabbed and the vaccination booster programme is fully underway.”Dr Juan Carlos Jaramillo, Valneva’s Chief Medical Officer, told reporters at a briefing: “Regarding the contract, currently we can not comment further at this stage.“But with the positive results from our pivotal phase three trial we do believe that VLA 2001 will have a validated potential value of our differentiated vaccine candidate within the Covid-19 vaccine landscape.“Of course, we await further approval and further updates will be offered in the coming days.”More from NewsThe EU is an obsolete empire that has condemned itself to irrelevanceGPs told not to engage with Government plan to increase face-to-face appointmentsBritish soldier died after elephant threw him 20ft into air on its tusks, inquest hearsTory MP calls for ‘David’s Law’ to get tough on online trolls in wake of fatal attackSpanish PM calls for king to be stripped of immunityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"having wrong conversations extremism britain","story":"It seems every new extremist attack we face is followed by the almost inevitable, gut-wrenching news: the attacker was known to authorities.Manchester bomber Salman Abedi was on MI5’s radar Usman Khan, the Fishmonger’s Hall knifeman participated in deradicalisation and rehabilitation schemes both inside and outside prison walls. One of the 2017 London Bridge attackers’ extremism was so well documented that he appeared in a Channel 4 undercover programme: ‘The Jihadis Next Door’.Sir David Amess MP’s alleged assailant, meanwhile, was previously referred to Prevent, the Government’s counter-radicalisation strategy. Forget ‘lone wolves’ - try known wolves.As with the rest of the regrettably long list of attacks we’ve experienced, many will ask whether the authorities missed some crucial opportunity to avert tragedy. At this stage, so little is known that jumping to grand conclusions is a risky business. Nevertheless, police are investigating ‘Islamist extremist’ motives and it seems the suspect, 25 year old Ali Harbi Ali of Kentish Town, was offered one-on-one mentoring through Prevent after being referred while still in Sixth Form.It is important to note that Prevent is not the security services and a referral means no offence has yet been committed, so reaching Prevent would not have put Harbi Ali on any watchlist or investigation that might somehow have thwarted his plans. He was referred to the voluntary scheme as a teenager and is not suspected of acting until years later. This is categorically different to say, Sudesh Amman, the jihadi tailed by armed police in the moments leading up to his botched martyrdom operation in Streatham.It also demonstrates the complexity and difficulty of attempting to intervene to prevent radicalisation, or to deradicalise the growing number of extremists in our prisons. On this, supporters of such schemes and interventions must carefully manage expectations. There is no blueprint or silver bullet for erting or undoing radicalisation, for changing beliefs and a person’s entire moral framework. You can’t just put someone in one end of such a programme and expect them to come out the other end a democratic, law-abiding citizen.This is particularly the case when there is so much confusion over how people become radicalised in the first place. Too many of our current assumptions downplay the inidual agency of terrorists, casting radicalisation as an involuntary process akin to grooming, a form of hypnosis caused by mere exposure to online content or caused by structural factors which ‘drive’ unthinking people to violence.These assumptions have profound implications for counter-terrorism policy and risk distracting from the realities of both a domestic Islamist extremist scene and a networked jihadi population which has been steadily growing and recruiting in Britain over the past two to three decades - long before any ‘slick’ ISIS propaganda emerged.Neither this movement, nor the iniduals who commit acts of violence in its name, are likely to have been motivated by abusive tweets or anonymous social media accounts, as toxic as they are, even if it makes for easier, more comfortable discussion than reality.Britain and her allies will face more jihadist terror in the coming years - that much is for certain - but we cannot hope to push back until we are more serious about tackling the ideological roots of the violence, more realistic about how people become radicalised, and more honest about our existing schemes to reverse it. Liam Duffy is a Strategic Advisor for the Counter Extremism ProjectMore from NewsThe EU is an obsolete empire that has condemned itself to irrelevanceGPs told not to engage with Government plan to increase face-to-face appointmentsBritish soldier died after elephant threw him 20ft into air on its tusks, inquest hearsTory MP calls for ‘David’s Law’ to get tough on online trolls in wake of fatal attackSpanish PM calls for king to be stripped of immunityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"prevent waste time comes stopping extremists","story":"For the family of Sir David Amess, who on Monday made the harrowing trip to the site of his tragic death at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, it must have come as another intolerable blow: Ali Harbi Ali, the 25-year-old man accused of killing the Southend MP, had been flagged to the Government counter-terrorism programme some years ago.Detail as to the extent of Ali\u0027s referral are as yet unclear and may have been minimal. Again and again in recent years, iniduals have committed appalling, deadly acts of terror after being referred to, or cleared by Prevent.Khairi Saadallah, who last year “executed” three men in a Reading park with single knife strikes to the head Ahmed Hasan, who tried to blow up a District line Tube train in 2017 with 400g of explosive laced with blades and bolts Sudesh Amman, who last year stabbed two people in Streatham after buying material to make a fake suicide belt and most lethally, Salman Abedi, who in 2017 packed a backpack with shrapnel and explosives to kill 22 at a Manchester Arena concert aimed at children: all had been flagged to Prevent. None had been stopped by it from killing. Perhaps most chilling of all was the case of Usman Khan, who in 2019 strapped blades to his wrists like characters in a computer game he played to kill two Cambridge University students at an event in London Bridge to celebrate the success of deradicalisation efforts.In the aftermath of each attack, the failures, too, seem eerily familiar. Report after report describes “lessons to be learned”, just as Ben Wallace, the security minister at the time, did after Hassan was found guilty of attempted murder. Inquest after inquest catalogues “opportunities missed”, just as David Munro, the Surrey police and crime commissioner, did in the same case. In particular, the Khan case exposed, according to Peter Clarke, the former head of the anti-terrorist branch at Scotland Yard, “extraordinary systemic failings that had unspeakably tragic consequences” as prison, probation, police and security services failed to share information effectively, or at all. Clarke’s report was entitled “A Preventable Tragedy”. If such a catalogue of catastrophe seems damning, Prevent cannot shoulder all the blame. It is only one strand of the Government’s counter-terror strategy, known as Contest, initially drawn up a little under 20 years ago, as the world reeled from the 911 attacks and re-tuned a Cold War mentality to fight a new, asymmetric threat. It was a threat whose exponents deployed not tanks and artillery, or even the car bombs of the IRA, but home-brewed, low-grade weapons made lethal by the suicidal willingness of zealots to perish in their own attacks, and often carried out against their own country and fellow citizens.The other parts to Contest – Pursue, Protect and Prepare – are hardly controversial. Pursue deals with the intelligence work of disrupting plots Protect in ramping up defences around vulnerable targets such as transport hubs Prepare in stopping acts of terror as quickly as possible. Prevent, meanwhile, has a far more nebulous, challenging remit – to stop people becoming terrorists in the first place.As such, it depends on a network of sources – police, teachers, religious leaders or concerned family members  – to flag up the radicalisation of students, or worshippers or relatives, say. The numbers are significant. In the year to March 2020, 6,287 referrals were made, roughly 20 a day, 88 per cent being men, and 54 per cent under the age of 20. Indeed, age is no barrier to extremism. In 2017, notably, a nine-year-old boy was referred to Prevent after declaring his support for Daesh in class, one of 108 under-15s reported that year. It later turned out he had been watching the group’s grisly execution videos online.Well-informed intelligence sources say that such large numbers mean “false positives are an accepted and expected norm”. Simply being referred to Prevent is by no means a one-way ticket to the top of MI5’s inbox. The 2018 update of the Contest strategy features a chart illustrating how Prevent referrals are handled. Like the triage system of an overwhelmed A\u0026ampE department, most are filtered away to make room for those considered genuine emergencies.Still, perhaps wary of the recent litany of lethal “missed opportunities”, the numbers kept for “treatment” – known as the Channel path – have been rising. Some 1,424 of 2020’s 6,287 referrals – about a quarter – were passed on to a “Channel panel” to decide if they should be offered “support”, which “might include “assistance with education or employment, health support or ideological mentoring”. Of the 1,424 cases discussed by Channel panels in the year to March 2020, 697 were adopted – almost exactly one in nine of the original referrals. Participation, though, is “entirely voluntary.”That is still a huge number. As a guide, MI5 might be looking at 3,000 cases at any one time. Full-time tracking of even one person requires big teams. Extending surveillance to all Channel cases, even if such a thing were democratically acceptable, “would be impossible for MI5”, the source said.That is not to say that Prevent is blameless. Indeed, it has been singled out for blame for years. In 2015, well before the latest sequence of attacks launched by Prevent veterans, Lady Manningham-Buller, head of MI5 at the time of the 77 bombings, said that “Prevent is clearly not working”.One reason is mistrust between various security agencies. Though police and MI5 largely get on, there is a lack of trust in the prison service. Prisons are, according to John Podmore, former governor of Belmarsh, notable for its terrorist prisoners, factories for fanaticism. Many serving short sentences mix with a hard core of those serving longer terms.Amman, the Streatham stabber, was one example. Sentenced in 2018 to three years for disseminating terrorist material, he served 20 months and “nearly all that time”, says Podmore, “in the Special Unit at Belmarsh. It was the worst possible place for him to be. Prison makes these people worse. They are released ready to kill and they do.”Such is his concern about prison radicalisation that he wonders why Ali waited for police to arrest him when so many other terrorists have sought “death-by-cop”. Is a long prison term, with its many opportunities to radicalise others, now part of the terrorist playbook?Perhaps the biggest issue with Prevent, however, is how it has become a battleground in the eternal war over political correctness. In the past few years, particularly since the murder of the MP Jo Cox in 2016 by a white nationalist, much of its resources have been erted from tracking Islamic fundamentalists to right-wing extremists. Last year, for example, 302 (43 per cent) of the cases adopted by Channel regarded right-wing radicalisation, while 210, or 30 per cent, concerned Islamism. But “although some right-wing extremists are dangerous people and have been convicted of dangerous offences”, says the source, “by and large they are hoodlums. They do not present the same risk as Islamists by any distance, by a factor of four or five to one. Everyone was trying very hard to be politically correct and not Islamophobic. But the whole process has become unbalanced. More time has been spent than appropriate on right-wing extremism and not Islamism. There needs to be some honest appraisal about where the threat is actually coming from.”There is a recognition that the system is not working. William Shawcross, former head of the Charity Commission, is leading an independent review, which was due to be submitted to the Home Office at the end of last month. It is likely to call for a more consistent approach nationwide, rather than Channel panels whose criteria vary in each local authority. It could also call for Prevent’s £40 million annual budget to be distributed in longer-term packages, rather than each year, which discourages programmes with consistent aims.The consequences of failure are all too evident. Almost 20 years after it was created, there remains no shortage of candidates being referred to Prevent, and no idea what to do with the radicals who are locked up. Other countries with noted deradicalisation programmes – Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany – do not fare dramatically better. As Lady Manningham-Buller put it five years ago, when noting Prevent was not working: “This is not altogether surprising because it is difficult. We do not really know what works.”More from NewsThe EU is an obsolete empire that has condemned itself to irrelevanceGPs told not to engage with Government plan to increase face-to-face appointmentsBritish soldier died after elephant threw him 20ft into air on its tusks, inquest hearsTory MP calls for ‘David’s Law’ to get tough on online trolls in wake of fatal attackSpanish PM calls for king to be stripped of immunityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris carries tier 4 busting","story":"Boris and Carries Tier -busting Christmas Day denial smells like festive porkie piesBoris Johnson and his we Carrie may be denying any wrongdoing in having their friend Nimco Ali visit Number  on Christmas Day, but what a kick in the teeth to the millions of us who went without family and friends for the greater good, writes Flic Everett and Carrie Johnson walk along the beach\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES n _JS.jpg\" width\"\" \"\" Boris and Carrie Johnson found themselves in hot water after it emerged their friend joined them in Number  for Christmas Day  - despite London being in Tier  lockdown Image: Getty ImagesopinionByFlic Everett:,  Oct | commentsLet’s start with denial, a state with which our Prime Minister is comfortably familiar.According to Boris and his we Carrie, they spent last Christmas all alone, much like many of us in the UK.There were no visitors, no fun and the chief excitement was translating A Christmas Carol into Latin to amuse little Wilfred. According to US Harper’s Magazine, however - which being American has fact-checkers coming out of its jewel-encrusted ears - the PM is telling festive-spiced porkie pies.According to the magazine, Nimco Ali, their friend and godmother to Wilfred, secretly spent last Christmas at Number . A spokeswoman for Carrie Johnson, however, snaps: “The PM and Mrs Johnson have followed coronavirus rules at all times. It is totally untrue to suggest otherwise.”How do you feel about the news the Prime Minister had a friend join them on Christmas Day  Have your say in the comments below Their definition of ‘rules’ can be hazy though, as we all know. In fact, it’s not the first time Tory-supporting campaigner and FGM activist Ali has hit the news. Last year she was appointed the government’s adviser on tackling violence against women and girls. It later emerged that she had been given the job via a “direct appointment process”, without any advertisement or competition for the £-a-day role.Employment ethics aside, when Ali was allegedly enjoying the prime ministerial mince pies, the PM’s subjects were not so lucky.Just before Christmas last year, the government screeched into a Bambi-on-ice U-turn, ditching its previously easy-going approach to festive lockdown rules, and plunging the vast swathes of the south eastright back into Tier  with its draconian ‘no mixing’ rules – which meant no mingling with anyone not from your household. For the rest of the country, some mixing was allowed on Christmas Day only, which meant long-anticipated family visits and trips all had to be scrapped with just a couple of days warning, large turkeys were chucked away and carefully chosen kids’ presents hidden until spring when visits could once again resume. But none of the practical dficulties we all suddenly faced compared to the waves of disappointment and sadness. For some, it would have been the last time they’d see their elderly parents – and even that bittersweet joy was gone.  After almost a year living under the brutal strictures of the pandemic, Christmas was a light in the darkness, suddenly extinguished, with long-awaited family togetherness reduced to a Zoom call and a ready meal for one. After a year when children couldn’t see their friends, they now couldn’t see their cousins to exchange gts and play games either, and single people, orcees, the lonely elderly and all the recently Covid-bereaved were left to stare at their TV alone. It’s a bleak picture, but reportedly one that didn’t trouble the man tasked with leading our beleaguered country through its most painful period of loss, fear and damage since World War II. At Downing Street, perhaps there was togetherness – an exchange of presents, laughter and fun. They wouldn’t have wanted their close friend to be alone at Christmas. Few, in fact, wanted that. And yet so many did it for the greater good, afraid of spreading a deadly disease for which there was not yet a vaccine. Personal sacrice was writ large in every abandoned visit and unbought gt. If it transpires that Johnson and his we didn’t do the same, by this Christmas he should, at long last, be out of a job.

Speaking in the wake of the death of Sir David Amess – the Southend West MP who was killed in a suspected act of Islamist terror – Mr Francois said he was proposing “David’s law”. The Conservative former minister said the Governmentaposs Online Harms Bill should be toughened up markedly to stop MPs being systematically vilied. Sir David was stabbed multiple times while at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea on Friday. Counter terror cops have arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of murder and have said there may be a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism. The death has led to criticism of the Home Office for failing to protect MPs in the wake of Jo Coxaposs murder in  and over its Prevent anti-extremism programme.Others have levelled criticism at social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube for failing to tackle online hate.Mr Francois, who said sir David was his “best and oldest friend in politics”, said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, the CEOs of Facebook and Twitter to answer for their inactions. He said: “In the last few years David had become increasingly concerned about what he called the toxic environment in which MPs, particularly female MPs were having to operate in.” He added: “He was appalled by what he called the vile misogynistic abuse which female MPs had to endure online and he told me very recently that he wanted something done about it.” He told fellow MPs in the the Commons on Monday that while MPs should be open to legitimate criticism, they should be protected from horrendous abuse. He said: “I suggest thatwe want to ensure that our colleague didn’t die in vain, we collectively all of us pick up the baton, regardless of our party and take the forthcoming Online Harms Bill and toughen it up markedly. “So let’s put,I may be so presumptuous, David’s law onto the statute book, the essence of which would be that while people in public le must remain open to legitimate criticism, they can no longer be vilied or their families subject to the most horrendous abuse, especially from people who hide behind a cloak of anonymity with the connivance of the social media companies for profit.”The MP went on: “If the social media companies don’t want to help us drain the Twitter swamp, then let’s compel them to do it by law because they’ve had more than enough chances to do it voluntarily.”During the debate, Boris Johnson announced that Southend would get city status - something which Sir David had long campaigned for.He also paid tribute to one of the “nicest, kindest and most gentle” MPs. Mr Johnson praised the Southend West MP as a politician who “simply wanted to serve the people of Essex” as a backbench Conservative. He vowed that the “contemptible act of violence” that took Sir David’s le on Friday at a surgery for constituents would not “detract from his accomplishments as a politician or as a human being”. Labour leader Keir Starmer, meanwhile, urged MPs not to lose sight of the fact that Sir Davidaposs death was an act of terror.He said: Even as a political opponent he was a man and a politician we could all learn much from. I use that phrase - ‘political opponent’ - very deliberately. Because David held his beliefs passionately but gently. I believe that not only can we learn from that but that we have a duty to do so. Civility in politics matters. But we must not lose sight of the fact that David’s killing was an act of terror on the streets of our country.

Some .million people claim both Disability Living Allowanceor its replacement Personal Independence Payment- paid to help people with the costs of being disabled - and Employment and Support Allowanceor its replacement within Universal Credit . In a Green Paper published over the summer, the Department for Work and Pensionssaid: “In future, we could look to create a new single benefit. “This could both provide support for disabled people and people with health conditions on low income and with extra costs. “Alternatively, a new benefit could have dferent priorities or a dferent set of objectives to our current system. “More focus could be put on supporting people with their extra costs, or on helping people to find and stay in work.” This has raised some fears for claimants - as PIP and DLA are paid regardless of wealth, while ESA and UC depend partly on your income. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said this month she is “not aware” of any plans to cut PIP, but did not rule out merging the benefits together. She told a Tory conference event “I don’t think we’re looking at” merging non-means-tested PIP with means-tested UC, and the reform would not be “just trying to force-fit dferent benefits together”. However, she added: “Everything is on the table is I think the best way of saying it, because the Green Paper is quite broad and we want to get some focus on genuine innovative thinking. “Are these benefits actually working, that’s the question I often ask my officials. Are they having the intended desire, andnot, what are we going to do about that ”  Ms Coffey also suggested she was concerned by the number of people claiming PIP for mental health dficulties, saying she wanted to “target that even more so to people who really need that support”. She added: “PIP has certainly grown in a way that was not anticipated when it was introduced. “To give you an example, three out of four young people who claim PIP have their primary reason being mental ill health. “That in itself is , young people who currently receive benefit focused on that. There may be other benefits they receive as well. “So that’s one of the things where I’m very conscious one of things I’m trying to do as Secretary of State is very much the issues we face are downstream, and what are the things we need to do to get more upstream.” At present, dferent assessments have to be held for PIP DLA and ESA UC - and the DWP reports people find it dficult and confusing to go through the same process repeatedly. Some have told the DWP that having more than one face-to-face assessment is extremely distressing.But others are worried that under a single benefit scheme, their finances would depend on the outcome of just one appointment, as also reported by BirminghamLive.The DWPsays keeping all these dferent existing benefits and having just one assessment wouldnapost work - but a brand new scheme would be a way to make the whole system simpler. At present, those with health conditions or disabilities who arenapost working or are on a low wage can put in a claim for payments under Universal Credit. Many are still on ESA , which UC is replacing. Separately, they can also apply for PIPto meet the extra costs of their condition, regardless of their income. It is worth a maximum of £. a week. Some still get the older benefit Disability Living Allowance, which PIP is replacing. The DWP Green Paper said: People who are on PIP as well as claiming either ESA or UC with a health condition currently go through two separate application and assessment processes. This means that people sometimes feel the same information is requested twice. The dferent purposes of the separate benefits are also not always clear to people claiming them. Some people have told us that having to go through two separate processes can be confusing and dficult. People told us that there needs to be a simpler application and assessment process. Some people felt that having a single health and disability benefit would help achieve this. Other people were worried about all their financial support depending on the outcome of one assessment. introducing a single assessment into the current system would not be beneficial. The benefits have been designed separately and each assessment considers dferent criteria.” It “added: If we were to introduce a new single benefit, depending on how this was designed and its objectives, it might be possible to use a single assessment. Alternatively, we might be able to simply access to this new benefit in some other way. The report added: We will consider the impact of any potential changes to the benefits system on the other benefits and support we provide for disabled people and people with health conditions. For example, changes to PIP, UC or ESA could affect benefits such as Carer’s Allowance and Attendance Allowance. We will look holistically at any changes we make, to avoid unintended consequences. We are committed to making any changes collaboratively, working with and listening to the people who receive and rely on our benefits. Universal Credit is also available to those without medical problems and, in those cases, people donapost need an appointment with a health professional. But any income and savings are assessed every month before the DWP decides how much money will be paid into accounts. Almost six million people claim UC, with numbers doubling during the pandemic.The standard allowance forUniversal Credithas now been cut by £ a month, following the removal of a coronavirus top-up that was provided from April  to September .

The Information Commissioner’s Officehas told the Department for Health it failed to comply with a Freedom of Information request by the Good Law Project to name the  companies fast-tracked to supply personal protective equipment . Ministers have been accused of cronyism after it emerged several firms linked to senior Tories were placed in a aposhigh priority laneapos when the pandemic hit the UK. The ICO has said the government has  days to hand over the information to the campaign group or may face court action. Jo Maugham, director of Good Law Project, said: “Cronyism carries a double cost. It empties the public purse into the pockets of friends of the government. And it leads to bad outcomes for public health. He added: “Good Law Project, which first revealed the existence of the VIP lanes for PPE and Test and Trace, will continue the dficult but important work of exposing the truth around the government’s sleazy pandemic procurement.”  The government has argued that a VIP lane was a “perfectly reasonable and rational” response during the chaos of the pandemic. A probe of £.bn worth of deals for masks, gloves and gowns and other PPE by the National Audit Office found companies with connections to politicians and senior officials were ten times more likely to win contracts in the early months of the pandemic. The spending watchdog said the Government had failed in its duty to be “fair and transparent”. A response to the Government from the Information Commissioner reads: “The DHSC has not disclosed the requested information, nor advised the Commissioner that it considers it is otherwise exempt by virtue of another exemption. The DHSC has therefore failed to comply with its obligations under FOIA .” It goes on to warn “failure to comply may result in the Commissioner making written certication of this fact to the High Court … and may be dealt with as a contempt of court”.The Government is also under pressure after it was revealed Cabinet minister Michael Gove, and Cabinet Office Minister Lord Agnew, referred six firms down a fast track ‘VIP’ route to bid for lucrative Test and Trace contracts.An FOI response to the Good Law Project confirms “a total of  offers of help were received to the VIP email address: covidtestingtriage@dhsc.gov.uk from the Private Office of Michael Gove and the Private Office of Lord Agnew”. The Government had previously claimed allegations of a VIP lane for test and trace contracts were .

As the shock waves reverberate around the death of a good man, the hunt for answers continues without even a hint of self-awareness.My Mirror colleague, Ros Wynne-Jones, is behind the brilliant Britain Talks campaign which aims to get the country doing just that.The trouble is, so many of us still don’t talk. So many of us WhatsApp, email, Facebook or tweet, tapping away in a cess pit with a race to the bottom in terms of our discourse. The empathy has gone. The respect for peers and authority, a staple of older generations, is a thing of the past. It won’twith screens between MPs and their constituents or police officers on the doors of surgeries. They are the ideas of a regime with a left hand over its eyes and their right hand feeling around in the dark. Complacency will eventually replace the concern to be seen to be doing something anyway after the killing of Sir David Amess and, heartbreakingly, we will be back here in a few years’ time - just as after Jo Cox in , Stephen Timms in  and Nigel Jones in .We are all at risk from an atmosphere that threatens to consume us, never mind extremists. My jaw hit the floor when we heard that the inidual held in connection with the death threat sent to MP Chris Bryant is  years of age. I remember, as we neared the end of the last lockdown, hearing friends’ fears that things could explode after it was lted with so many people having spent so long shouting at each other online.  Don’t kid yourself that the trolls are teenagers or twenty-somethings still living at home and eating cornflakes way past lunchtime in their pyjamas. Many wear suits and ties, carry laptops and enjoy top jobs with big s. None see any problem hammering politicians on all sides or the likes of Meghan Markle. Even the debate about finally cracking down on hate speech online is quite something when ordinary people, footballers, celebrities and other politicians have been begging for it for years now without success. Ask the likes of Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler.  Justice Secretary Dominic Raab and MPs such as Bernard Jenkin and Mark Francois are among those now urging us all to be kinder.Tell that to Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, both called out by England footballer Tyrone Mings for refusing to condemn those booing our national team for taking the knee. This is the least kind government in living memory.A government that wants to hand immunity to people causing others to drown in the English Channel. A government whose ministers belted out karaoke tunes at their party conference earlier this month on the day they cut Universal Credit for millions.  A government whose hostile environment campaign has seen lives lost and millions of families devastated. A government whose Prime Minister was given the chance to dial down his racially offensive rhetoric about Muslim women and black people and chose instead to double down. When MP Paula Sherrf complained in parliament in  of the abuse and harassment she and other female MPs were being subjected to, Johnson suggested “the best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and [to] dial down the current anxiety…[was] to get Brexit done”. None of that justies violence. Ever. What it underscores is our need for a period of introspection and the drawing of a line in the sand. It should never have taken the passing of a good man to spark that.

When he must have looked in that pair of eyes who’ve miserably failed humanity and just thought… why It’s ironic that Sir David died while doing what he thought he was born for to do: talking to and working for the people he felt responsible for. He trusted people and he was the most trusted. When I first met David Amess, he was still a new MP from Basildon. It was during an annual conference of the Conservative Party in  where at the end, he was willing to sign our petition. I had strong feelings about him from the very first moment. His warm character, his unique humour. Even though I never would believe that our own struggle for liberating Iran from dictatorship would take a few decades, I felt that I would be friends with David for a very long time. Throughout the years, when we reached out to UK parliamentarians, he was one of the most active and helpful people in the lower house. He was the kind of constituency MP who appears to be married to his own people. But not only his own, it was actually all the people. Every time we wandered into his office, we bypassed his gallery of pictures where well-known faces posed with Sir David’s beautul smile. You could see him and his family with the Pope and Mother Theresa as well. When reaching his desk, he’d just say “What do you want, Hossein  What can I do for you ” And he almost immediately would ask his secretary to bring the calendar to open a slot for us. He never said no to anybody. Or maybe just to himself. He played a crucial role alongside Andrew MacKinlay when we were fighting the UK blacklist against our organisation. After Lord Corbet passed away, he became the leader of the British Committee for Iran Freedom . When our brothers and sisters in Camp Ashraf in Iraq were under attack by Iran-backed militiamen, I woke Sir David up at am and all I heard was, “How can I help ” Once, he had a planned surgery in Southend West when we asked him to lead the British delegation in the Free Iran Summit of  in Albania. But he finally managed to get himself a plane and made it to Ashraf  by . CEST, rushed on the stage, and held his arms high with the books of both Houses’ support for the cause of bringing freedom and democracy to Iran.He always told his family about me and my friends, calling us “the true champions of human rights” and he would say that the things that he was doing for his people are nothing in comparison. We always disagreed and I told him that all I’m doing is for the Iranian “Sir Davids” to run my country. But after what happened to him, I believe he was literally a true champion of human rights and humanity.  When former Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow gave a speech at Sir David’s th anniversary in the lower chamber, he charmingly pointed out how Sir David has always been the backbencher. That he had been running many important sessions and helped make many important decisions but never claimed credit for anything. He was never seeking a name or driving attention to himself.It was ashe was in for the “small things”. Even for the sake of explaining, I’m still ashamed to put it that way. These were the most important steps. Sir David did everything to turn Southend into a city. He was a staunch supporter of the Southend football team. When he and Penny Mordaunt helped to get  children with learning disabilities to play at the Royal Albert Hall, it was like one of his greatest achievements. Or maybe it actually was.When we visited his constituency, everyone was crying. An old man told us how much Sir David was loved. He said that he’s got a sick we and the only person who would care was Sir David. A young man approached us with wet eyes and started to talk about Sir David. When words failed to express feelings, they’d just say: “Amess was Amess.”  At his office, people were in shock and awe. Everyone was crying. People wanted to talk to us as they knew how dear he was to the Iranians. Especially his fellow parliamentarians. Those pictures at the office looked dferent now. Like all those great men and women were sad too.The very fact that he was so in love with his work and his people made it very hard for me to ask him for help on issues that were happening thousands of miles away. I felt guilty, asI was stealing him from his people. But he was the kindest to reach out to and after all, we were his people too. His Ayes Ears belonged to everyone.It’s tragic that people’s true value of le is only appreciated after their passing, and I believe we’re just too busy with ourselves that we fail to see and feel others when they’re around. But Sir David proved that politics is all about the “small things” and the “common people” rather than in the higher echelons of power. He was a kind of a mentor to me and I’m sure to the younger generation who might enter politics. He taught us that politics isn’t just about to be trusted, it’s about to trust. And he paid for it very dearly. Because Amess was Amess and his achievements will live on... far beyond Southend West.

Bushra Zafar-Khan, , was devastated when her beau, who lived in Pakistan, ended their long-distance betrothal - so much so that she decided to change her le. The mum-of-one, who lives in Canary Wharf, started her weight loss journey as a new yearaposs resolution in January  after realising her weight was st lb. She said: I was heartbroken when my engagement was called off because I was really looking forward to getting married, but it wasn’t meant to be. But after making changes to her le and watching the weight fall off her, Bushra had the confidence to open herself up to love again.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Five years on, sheaposs now married to her husband Fahad, , and they share three-year-old son, Salman. She said: “I thank my lucky stars that everything in le led me to where I am now - six stone lighter with a loving husband and a perfect little boy.” Bushra was introduced to her long-distance fiancé in  when she went to visit relatives in Pakistan. “I couldn’t wait to be married, so when he called off the engagement in December , I was devastated,” she said. She was  at the time and worried the clock was ticking for her.  Bushra added: I have polycystic oies, so I already thought it was probably too late for me to have children. I found the whole experience so depressing and, while deep down I knew the engagement hadn’t been called off because of my weight, I couldn’t help but feel low over it. I knew I wanted to make a change. A size  at the time, Bushra decided to search for weight loss support groups online and found advice from other women on how to sht the pounds. She said: It wasn’t necessarily how much I was eating, because I probably eat more now since the weight loss, but it was the type of foods I was eating. I was just having all the wrong things, like pizza, and at the wrong times. Although not hugely overweight, Bushra said her size was affecting how she felt about herself and spilled into her everyday le. She said: Even though I love sports, I couldnapost run as much because of my weight and lack of energy. Sometimes, when you’re bigger, you feel like certain things, such as failed relationships, are down to your weight. Even though it’s probably not that, it definitely knocks your confidence. In January , she discovered the DA Group after it was recommended by a friend. Bushra said: The DA Group offer dferent weight plans that you can follow, where they advise how much protein and vegetables to have in one sitting.  I started taking an energy supplement in the morning and following their suggestions at mealtimes. It’s quite flexible though, so I was still able to have a little treat in the day and, because you can have treats, there was nothing I was missing out on. They allow cheat days too which helped me with cravings. Within a month of following the new plan, Bushra said she lost more than a stone and dropped two dress sizes. A year later, she lost a whopping six stone, weighing in at st lb. It was incredible, I was wearing a size  which I never thought I would be. I felt so much more confident within myself. And with a new glow from the confidence sheaposd gained, Bushra even found love.  She said: I worked with Fahad at the university. I think he might have always fancied me but when we met, he knew I was engaged, so never pursued it. A few months after my engagement was called off, Fahad asked me out and I agreed to go for a coffee with him. I knew pretty early on that he was the one. The couple got engaged in July  and tied the knot just three months later. Bushra said: Everything happened really fast, even my pregnancy. I fell pregnant just two weeks after getting married. In July , Bushra welcomed little Salman into the world. All this time I was worried about my fertility, but I fell pregnant so quickly and naturally, she said. I think my weight loss played a role in that, but I also think it was just meant to be. Now Bushra is happier than ever with her new le - although she admits sheaposs still getting used to her figure. She said: It’s hard to believe sometimes that I’ve managed to lose so much weight and keep it off. I didn’t notice much of dference at first but people around me definitely did. It wasn’t until I started comparing photos that I realised how much weight I had lost. She now enjoys wearing stylish clothes, rather than hiding behind baggier fits.

Unfortunately this website does not have the infrastructure to answer all these enquiries inidually, however we can confirm that there is no truth in the rumour whatsoever. One of the more persistent rumours links Banksy with Massive Attack musician Robert Del Naja, also known as D. Before his rise with the iconic Bristol trip hop band, Del Naja was considered to be the cityaposs first graffiti artist and a pioneer of the stencil art movement. In what could be a cunning double bluff, heaposs been praised by Banksy as an early influence and the pair are said to be friends. However, fans were left convinced they could be one and the same after singer Goldie aposlet slipapos Robaposs name while mentioning Banksy in a  podcast interview. He said: Give me a bubble letter and put it on a T-shirt and write aposBanksyapos on it and weaposre sorted, we can sell it now. No disrespect to Rob, I think heaposs a brilliant artist. I think he has flipped the world of art over. One theory put forward by Scottish journalist Craig Williams is that Banksy could in fact be a collective of artists - although he suggested it could be headed up by Del Naja. He wrote: A multi disciplined artist in front of one of the seminal groups in recent British history, doubling up as the planetaposs most revered street artist. Now that would be cool.  The most popular theory, however, is that Banksy is the lesser known artist Robin Gunningham. In , a photograph emerged of a man in Jamaica with a spray can at his feet that was said to show the artist at work. A Mail On Sunday article claimed to have identied the man as former public schoolboy Gunningham after talking to his childhood pals in Bristol. The theory took off further in  when Banksyaposs lawyers tried to delay the publication of a report by researchers from Queen Mary University which used aposgeographic profilingapos to unmask him. The technique - often used to catch serial criminals - analysed the locations of  artworks to seethere were any common links with the main apossuspectsapos.“I’d be surprisedit’s not [Gunningham]” Steve Le Comber, a biologist and co-author of the study, told the BBC. “It rapidly became apparent that there is only one serious suspect, and everyone knows who it is. Mysterious apossightingsapos of legendary artist While heaposs impressively avoided the limelight for decades, a few apossightingsapos of Banksy have been reported over the years. In , a man in a hi-vis jacket was snapped spraying the White Horse pub in Liverpool.  Taken years after the painting had been confirmed as authentic, itaposs believed to be the first picture of the artist at work - but his face is frustratingly hard to make out. Then in , a graffiti artist in Australia was caught on video spraying a wall in Melbourne, Australia - signing it off as Banksy. The woman behind the camera chases down the man as he hurries away, causing him to turn around and yell f*** off before fleeing. However, the artwork didnapost quite look Banksyaposs usual style - and his team later insisted it was a fake. Shortly afterwards, footage emerged of a man spraying an underpass in Briston for a Sunday Times Magazine piece on the artist. The shaky footage shows an artists arriving on a bike to paint the wall before taking off, though itaposs thought he could also be a member of the iconaposs team.  Earlier this summer, Banksy filmed himself in the act, taking to Instagram to claim credit for new spectacular street murals which had been discovered in Suffolk and Norfolk.The mystery artist uploaded a video of himself getting down to work at locations after driving a campervan packed full of spray paint. He called the clip A Great British Spraycation - and of course, didnapost show his face.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplc Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BanksySothebysArt\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

By contrast in Scotland - where children can use walk-in centres - take-up is already over % in half of local authority areas. James Bowen, policy director at school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It remains crucial that the in-school programme is rolled out as quickly as possible. “We know that the health teams working in schools are working tirelessly to achieve this, but they need full support from the Government. “Those who want to get the vaccination should be able to do so as quickly as possible. “Allowing - year olds to attend walk-in vaccination centres would be a sensible decision.” Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Three million pupils aged between  and  across the UK are eligible to receive a first dose of the Covid- vaccine as part of a rollout that began a month ago.

Pharmaceutical firm Valneva had set up a manufacturing plant in Livingstone, Scotland, and announced its jab showed stronger antibody responses than the AstraZeneca jab. It is hoped the vaccine will trigger a stronger T-cell response that is a more robust defence against new iants. The phase three trial had recruited , people across  trial sites in the UK. Lead trial investigator Prof Adam Finn, of Bristol University, who also sits on the JCVI, said: “The low levels of reactogenicity and high al antibody responses alongside broad T-cell responses seen with this adjuvanted inactivated whole virus vaccine are both impressive and extremely encouraging. “This is a much more traditional approach to vaccine manufacture than the vaccines so far deployed in the UK, Europe and North America and these results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic.”The UK deal with the French company for  million doses was scrapped last month as Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs it had been “clear” the vaccine “would not get approval” here.Prof Finn said Mr Javid’s comments had been “corrected in Hansard” and suggested they were incorrect. Valneva’s chief medical officer Dr Juan Carlos Jaramillo told a briefing they expected to get UK approval around the turn of the year.

Catherine Young, , put the defenceless black and white kitten, called Morritz, in the machine as a punishment for pooing inside her home in Clacton, Essex. She smeared the kittenaposs face in its own faeces before going through with her cruel act. Young, , admitted to two animal welfare offences following a prosecution by the RSPCA. Colchester Magistratesapos Court heard -week-old black and white kitten Morritz died after being put on a full cycle as a punishment for going to the toilet in the house. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She has now been disqualied indefinitely from keeping all animals. The court heard how the RSPCA was contacted after Young rang a veterinary practice on June  to say one of her kittens had died at home. When she eventually arrived at the practice later that evening, she had with her one live male kitten called Bobbitz, and a dead kitten called Morritz, who was cold and stf with wet fur. The court heard that when questioned about what had happened by a veterinary surgeon at the practice, Young admitted she had put Morritz in the washing machine because she had been naughty and defecated in the house. She said she had rubbed the kittenaposs face in the faeces to tell her off before putting her in the washing machine on a short cycle to clean her fur. She said she had done this before and Morritz had been fine.  Young also admitted to the vet that she had withheld food and water from both kittens in the past for at least  hours because they had been naughty. Bobbitz, a semi long haired black and white kitten, was examined and found to be clinically well. Young was told that he would stay at the practice to be looked after and she would be unable to have him back. RSPCA inspector Jessica Dayes, who investigated the case, interviewed Young on June . No other animals were seen at the address, however empty litter trays, cat litter, a broken cat carrier and a bag of cat food were still in the kitchen, she said. In his witness statement to the court, the vet said: It is my opinion that the deceased kitten had undergone signicant unnecessary suffering by being deliberately placed in a washing machine and then this being placed on a wash cycle. The spinning of the machine and the water would have caused signicant pain, injury and huge amounts of stress. Young, who represented herself, said she had a personality disorder and mental health issues. She was also fined £ and ordered to pay £ in costs and a £ victim surcharge. Bobbitz has been renamed Gulliver and is doing well in a new home.

Harry’s daughter Ann Hudson, , immediately called for an ambulance at .pm. She said: “We rushed down to his house, me and my brother, and he was lying on the floor.  “We managed to get him up and into a chair, but he was in a lot of pain, so I rang  as you do, because I thought I can’t move him, not really, because he was in too much pain to be moved. “When I rang  they said it could be a while, so I rang back a number of times, at least twice to get an update. “A clinician did ring and went through a number of questions but it was seven hours before they actually turned up to pick him up, and it turns out he’d broken his thigh bone.” Despite the agonising seven-hour wait for an ambulance, his daughter said that Mr Soar blames government cuts to health services rather than the NHS or East Midlands Ambulance Service. Further delaying treatment was the fact that Mr Soar had to be taken to Queenaposs Medical Centre, in Nottingham, as the Royal Derby Hospital did not have the capacity to treat him, added his daughter Ann. Due to the non-le-threatening nature of Harry’s fall, his request for an ambulance was logged as a category  call - one which is potentially serious and requires possible pain control and treatment. But category  calls are not immediately le-threatening and therefore are not a priority to the ambulance service. Nationally, the ambulance service aims to respond to these calls within an average time of  minutes, and nine times out of ten within two hours. Instead, Mr Soar had to wait in his home in pain for seven hours. His daughter continued: “They said it could be up to six hours, but we were hoping for less than that. “When it came to six hours time and they hadn’t turned up, I rang them back and they said it could be six or more hours. “They weren’t friendly on the phone I would say, they were just very busy. “I just don’t think it’s right, especially with an -year-old being left that long in pain. “On the day I was very angry because obviously your parents are your responsibility basically, and you’ve got to look after them when they get older.” Mr Soar was eventually seen by the ambulance crew and taken to Nottingham’s Queen’s Medical Centre, after being told that Royal Derby hospital was closed to emergencies because they were too busy. Despite their long wait, Harry and his family understand that the delay was a result of high demand for NHS services. Ann said: Despite waiting seven hours for an ambulance, he doesnapost blame them, he blames the government cuts for the delay. After breaking his thigh bone during the fall, Mr Soar has since had an operation to help his mobility. Craig Whyles, service delivery manager for Derbyshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service, said: “We are very sorry to hear that we were unable to get to Mr Soar sooner on this occasion and I recognise the distress that this will have caused to him and his family. “Every  call is assessed based on the information provided by the caller and people experiencing a le-threatening emergency such as cardiac arrest or breathing dficulties have to be seen first. “Using the information shared during the initial call, this incident was categorised as not immediately le-threatening. “At the time there was a high demand on EMAS and the wider NHS system, and we were responding to a number of people whose le was reported to be at immediate risk. “We are currently in contact with Mr Soar and his family through our Patient Advice and Liaison Service and will fully investigate the reason for this delay.” Comment MORE ON NHSHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A stunning image of Kate was snapped as she arrived at Prince Philipaposs funeral in April and has since captured the publicaposs imagination.It shows Kate arriving at St Georgeaposs Chapel in Windsor in her car wearing a black face mask and a thin lace veil pulled across her eyes. And according to royal author Emily Andrews, the gorgeous snap - and her presence at the event - proved she was fit to be the future Queen.  Emily told the Channel aposs documentary, Kate: Our Queen in Waiting: Here was a woman at the top of her game, perfectly turned out. But also, quite rightly, taking her place as one of the most senior members of the Royal Family. I think it was one of those photographs where you really saw Queen Catherine in waiting, frankly.

She said: A thriving natural world regulates our climate, nurtures our physical and mental health, and helps feed our families. But for too long, we have neglected our wild spaces. And now we are facing a number of tipping points. If we don’t act now, we will permanently destabilise our planet. And we will rob our children of the future they deserve. Our Earthshot Prize Finalists show us, however, that we can, by , see the natural world growing, not shrinking, for the first time in centuries.

But when it comes to choosing baby names in the UK, it seems many parents tend to think alike - with several favourite names seeming to top the charts every year. Names like Amelia and Isla often top the list of girlsapos names, with Jack and James always being firm favourites for newborn boys.  And the top choice for both girls and boys remains unchanged this year - with Olivia and Oliver taking first preference among parents in England and Wales for the eighth year in a row. However, it seems these names tend to be most popular with older parents, as the data also showed that younger parents favoured shorter names like Leo and Theo for boys and Ava and Ivy for girls.  For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that, for both boysapos and girlsapos names, the top  was slightly changed. Whereas Grace and Freya made the shortlist the previous year,  data shows those favourites had been replaced by Ivy and Rosie.And Charlie was knocked out of the top  for boysapos names for the first time since  - being replaced by Archie, which could have been influenced by Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs son. Whataposs your favourite baby name  Have your say in the comment section below. Statistics from the last  years show boysapos names Arthur and Noah have soared up the ranks in popularity to rank in the top five in . The two biggest climbers for boysapos names in  were Milo and Otis, which went up by about  places. According to the ONS, parents over the age of  were more likely to choose traditional names while younger parents tended to choose modern, shortened names. Sian Bradford from the ONS said: Oliver and Olivia held on to the top spots as the most popular boysapos and girlsapos names in  but some interesting changes took place beneath them. We continue to see the age of mothers having an impact on the choice of baby name. Archie jumped into the top  boysapos names for the first time, driven by younger mothers as well as the obvious royal link, while on the girlsapos side, Ivy rose to sixth place. Popular culture continues to provide inspiration for baby names, whether itaposs characters in our favourite show or trending celebrities. Maeve and Otis, characters from the popular programme Sex Education, have seen a surge in popularity in , while the name Margot has been rapidly climbing since actress Margot Robbie appeared in the popular film The Wolf Of Wall Street.

Her recent video hit more than seven million views and resulted in her receiving horric abuse online,Manchester Evening News reports. The mum, from Wigan, told her followers about her daughter Parker falling ill RSV - or respiratory syncytial virus - when she was five weeks old. RSV is a viral illness that causes symptoms such as breathing problems and can lead to more severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young babies. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter She describes how Parker, who is now four months old, had to be moved from AE to a high dependency unit where she was put on a machine to do the breathing for her. The youngster was diagnosed with a severe chest infection but thankfully began to recover with the help of antibiotics. In the video, she had also said Parker spent the night with her gran - who lives a -minute drive away, before falling ill.  Many TikTok users blasted the mum for letting Parker have her first sleepover with her gran the night before she fell ill. One wrote: Jesus, five weeks and you are done with it already  Poor child isnapost gonna grow up the best. Another said: This is neglect. How could you do that to your newborn. Zoe has shared her own video hitting back at the comments. She told MEN: I posted the video originally to share my daughter’s story with RSV.  It made her very poorly and I was unaware how serious it could be in newborns. I hadn’t even heard about it until she was poorly and I wanted to make other mums aware of the signs. I had mentioned that she stayed with my mum the night before falling ill to show how quickly she declined but it wasn’t taken that way. People in the comments have branded me a bad mum because of my decision to allow my mum to have my child overnight.  To me, personally, it’s pretty normal for new mums to get support in anyway from family members but I didn’t know it would be so controversial online. I do regret mentioning her staying at my mumaposs because of the hate I have received, but I don’t regret sharing my daughteraposs story, because it could help save another child’s le. Zoe, who also has a three-year-old son Dominic with partner David Hunt, , also spoke about some of the disgusting comments she received. She said: The most hurtful is that I’m neglecting my children, I’m a bad parent, that my daughter deserved to die because she wouldn’t have bad parents. That I don’t deserve children or I shouldn’t have childrenI’m too lazy to look after them. The main hate I received was along the lines of aposhow could you leave your babyapos  It just shocked me how it’s encouraged as a new mum to accept help from people you trust because it can be overwhelming, but as soon as you do it’s seen as neglectful. I think the video going viral has proven the double standards for mums, there’s a lot of mum shaming and I don’t think it’s fair. Zoe, who is on maternity leave from her job at McDonaldaposs, said sheaposs been more willing to accept help from her mum with Parker as she was reluctant with Dominic despite suffering from postnatal depression. Zoe first started posting videos to TikTok during the lockdown and now has more than , followers. She said: I will carry on with it because at the end of the day itaposs my choice ultimately - my kids are fine and my kids are happy. They love spending time with my mum and what other people think is not going to change that, or change what Iaposm posting either. I have people who follow me and they chat to me daily and say they like seeing the content so I wonapost let this stop me.

Shocking photos show how Emily Priceaposs face ballooned and her her forehead aposcurled overapos into her eyes after applying the popular beauty treatment. Emily, , from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, said she was left with red and crusty-looking brows after a trip to the salon on September . The mum-of-one thought she wouldnapost need a patch test as she previously used the product routinely - though hadnapost since the pandemic outbreak. She was initially happy with the results, but claims her eyebrows started to tingle an hour after having them done and it felt like a aposhot pokerapos on her skin. But when Emily awoke unable to open her eyes properly she became concerned. She was horried when her startled husband leapt out of bed clutching a mirror so she could see her swollen, weeping face. Emily rang her GPaposs surgery but was forced to simply describe her symptoms over the phone as she couldnapost get a face-to-face appointment due to Covid. With her face continuing to balloon over the coming days, Emily went to AE where stunned staff prescribed her with powerful antibiotics to tackle the infection. Emily fears her new allergic reaction could be a result of having had the Covid vaccine, after reading about links made between people having had Covid or having the vaccine and experiencing new allergies, however there is nothing to prove that. And Emily, who is double-jabbed with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, still remains a staunch advocate of getting the vaccine.  Emily, whoaposs never experienced allergic reactions in the past, watched in horror as her scabby eyebrows dropped off in patches - forcing her to colour them in with an eyebrow pencil. Now healed, writer Emily is now speaking out about her ordeal to ensure no-one goes through what she has and is urging people to always carry out patch tests, eventhey have previously not had an allergy.Whether youaposre an actual mummy or just the sort made of bandages, Halloween will be a big deal in your house.

I thought maybe she left a little bit on so I gave my face a wash thinking it would get rid of any excess.  As the hours went on it started to feel like when you burn yourself on a hot pan and you pull your hand away quickly. It was like that but it was asI couldnapost pull away from it, it was just burning hot like there was a poker across my eyebrows. I went to sleep and when I woke up there was a moment of panic as I couldnapost open my eyes properly, they were just slits. My husband was next to me, he turned the light on and looked at me and he was like aposoh my god whataposs happened to your face apos.  He ran and got a mirror, I could barely even see myself because my eyes were so swollen and I noticed that close, underneath the eyebrows, it had gone yellow. Days later I ended up going into hospital because it got worse. I looked like Sloth from The Goonies. An hour after having the beauty treatment Emily started to experience a tingling sensation and the following day she woke up to discover her face had ballooned. Worried at how it would develop, Emily managed to get a GP appointment over the phone on September th and was prescribed face wash, antihistamines and a steroid cream. But the medications did not help, and Emily took herself to Prince Charles Hospitalaposs AE department in Merthyr Tydfil on September  and was seen quickly by a skin specialist who started her on a strong course of antibiotics. She took a week-long course of antibiotics that cleared her skin but was horried when patches of eyebrow hair dropped out. Emily is sharing her experience to urge people to always get patch tested - claiming that although itaposs a apospainapos itaposs not worth being left aposlooking like a car crashapos. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyspokesman said they investigate all reports of adverse effects from the vaccine. They added there is no current evidence to support Emilyaposs claim of the vaccine being responsible for her reaction.The agency recommends anyone experience adverse side effects from the vaccine to report it through he MHRA Yellow Card Scheme.Comment MORE ON AllergiesSkincareICELAND HALLOWEEN NEWSJACKING\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This affected the amount of financial support claimants were given by the DWP during certain time frames, SussexLive reports. The department altered the definition of social support in April , which led to many claimants seeing a change in their benefits payments. PIP is awarded to claimants who need additional financial assistance to pay for the living costs associated with a long-term physical or mental disability. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Payments are then handed out in two separate parts which are a daily living component and a mobility component. The daily living component has two dferent weekly rates, which is either a lower rate of £ and a higher one of £.. In regards, to the mobility component, it is either a lower rate of £. and a higher rate of £.. Usually, when someone begins their PIP application, they are assessed on their ability to interact with other people face-to-face. The rule change affects current PIP claimants, people who applied for PIP in the past but do not get it today and people moving from Disability Living Allowance . However, according to the DWP,a claimant needs “prompting” or reminded from a trained inidual in social situations, the department would now consider whether this comes under social support. The DWP stated: “The change also claries that social support is an ongoing need to help engage with other people. It does not need to be during or immediately before the activity.”  Following this, the DWP is looking to find current and past claimants who were affected by this change dating back to April . Specically, the DWP said: “This includes looking again at some claims we decided on or after April , , where PIP was awarded because of needing ‘prompting’ to engage with other people face to face. “We will now consider whether they need ‘social support’. This includes some claims where we did not award PIP.” However, the department claried that it will not be looking at claims which saw the enhanced rate of the daily living part of PIP being awarded continuously since April . Furthermore, the DWP will not reexamine a claima Tribunal has already made a decision or decision was made to not award PIP before April . In terms of eligibility, the DWP explained: “Not everyone will be eligible. If you are, we will write to you and you do not need to contact us. “It may take some time for you to get this letter. We are not planning to invite you for an assessment as part of this review, but we may contact you for more information. “If we decide that you should get more PIP, then your award will usually be backdated to  April . “If you claimed PIP after April , , it will usually be backdated to the date you started getting PIP.” All Britons who think they are eligible for PIP are encouraged to apply, with the rule changes now being factored into all future claims. People looking to apply for PIP can contact their local DWP centre or begin their application online.

It has long been said that Charles plans a major shake-up of the Royal Family when he becomes head of state - and it could also affect royal residences.In a bid to slim down the royal estate when he ascends to the throne, it has been reported that he will live in little more than “ a flat above the shop” at Buckingham Palace and use Highgrove as his family home. It is also understood that Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge will move from Kensington Palace to Windsor Castle, a relocation that the couple is said to want.It is likely we will see fewer royals around and a recalibration of what it means to be a working royal when Prince Charles steps up to the helm.In the latest episode of The ’s Royal Insight, Camilla Tominey has outlined the major changes expected to happen within the royal family and explained why the incoming monarch is expected to drive the new direction.Thereaposs this sense that he wants a slimmed down monarchy to make sure that everybody is doing their bit and [there are] no so-called hangers-on. Tominey said in the past there had been some negative publicity surrounding the more minor royals seemingly living in family accommodation and seemingly not doing much. “So I think this is basically Charles’ attempt to basically look like he’s inherited his mother’s habit for being frugal turning off light switches and being green, generally being good value for money, she explained. The death of the Queen, Tominey said, was going to cause a “seismic shock” for the British public and would necessitate an “enormous adjustment” from everybody. “Therefore I think there’s a sense of trying to make that as smooth as possible and trying to create a monarchy that’s fit for the future.”  With the slimming down of the royal family that we’ve seen so far, Tominey said, had come the need to ‘recalibrate’ what it means to be a royal.Back in Prince Philip ’s day, royal duties largely revolved around the charities and other organisations the prince was a patron for planting a tree or unveiling a plaque at an event.But younger royals like Kate and William had been forging a new path on which they were launching their own initiatives or projects centered around causes they were passionate about, driven by work online or podcasts. “That means by association that you’re going to have fewer royals taking on fewer patronages, and then what does that mean for the charities ” Tominey questioned. She pointed out that the departure of the Sussexes, Prince Andrew and Prince Philip from royal le meant that even now, there were “too few royals to go around’ comparatively to what the public were used to. And while she expected there would be a ‘stepping up’ of Charles and Camilla alongside the other royals, to take on these duties, Tominey said there may be too much work to go around.  The royal expert also said that a slimming down of the royal family might put some noses out of joint at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee the omission of all but seven royals from the balcony at Buckingham palace was said to have upset others who were not included. Moving forward, Tominey said, the Cambridges appeared to be trying to normalise the lives of their children, potentially paving the way for Charlotte and Louis to have their own careers outside of their royal lives. “It does make the future of the monarchy kind of uncertain,” she said. “We’ve had this model that the Queen has been at the head of for all of this time, because she’s obviously been on the throne for nearly seven decades.” But the next decade would see everything change, she said. Another major change that had been rumoured was the opening of Buckingham Palace to the public - an idea that Tominey thought likely to have been briefed in order to “exacerbate Prince Charles’ value-for-money credentials.

She perfected the art of mixing high and low, and blurred the lines between menswear and womenswear… She was all of these contradictions, and thataposs what made her so iconic - and what makes her so relevant to whataposs happening in fashion now.Other famous kids ranked in the research were Kim Kardashian and Kanye Westaposs eldest daughter, North Westand -year-old TikToker Charli DaposAmelio .Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess CharlotteRoyal FamilyBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The eldest Cambridge kid stood at the front looking over the thousands of people gathered below - and dad Wills crouched down to speak to him. However, granny clearly wasnapost impressed that the crowds would have been unable to see him, and appeared to berate her grandson by saying stand up William. Of course, the prince did as he was told and rose immediately, looking rather sheepish. Kate Middletonaposs epic eye roll  Kate has hardly put a foot wrong since joining the royal family after marrying Prince William in .In , while five months pregnant with Princess Charlotte, the couple travelled to New York, where Kate paid a visit to a childrenaposs centre to help them wrap Christmas presents.But after she stopped wrapping to chat to some of the volunteers, she was firmly told to keep wrapping.And in a rare candid moment, she light-heartedly rolled her eyes and did as she was told.Kate is said to have enjoyed the rest of her visit as she chatted happily with those at the centre.Princess Charlotteaposs meltdown  At only six years old, Princess Charlotte is probably just starting to learn how to navigate royal le.And in , when she was just two, she proved she was like any other toddler when she had a mini tantrum on the tarmac at Hamburg Airport.She had been visiting Germany and Poland with her parents and older brother Prince George when she and George had been given books as a gt.Her dad William took the book from her as they went to board a plane, but Charlotte clearly wasnapost ready to give it up and made her feelings clear.Cue some foot-stomping and collapsing to the floor in tears before mum Kate scooped her up in her arms - quickly avoiding a full-blown meltdown.Vexed Prince Harry  Itaposs known that Prince Harry is very protective of his we Meghan Markle and their children.So when a cameraman started getting too close to a pregnant Meghan on a visit to Morocco in  - he let his feelings be known.Harry was stood next to Meghan when he spotted the cameraman appearing to hit a child on the head with his equipment as he tried to get closer to the royal couple. The Duke quickly walked around the back of his we, presumably to not interrupt his host, before putting his hands on the lens and moving the man filming for Moroccan TV to one side. Prince Harry had a stern look on his face and instantly the cameraman backed off. The prince then put his hand on the girlaposs arm, askingshe was ok, before ing to listen to his host. Prince Georgeaposs tantrum  When a two-year-old Prince George visited the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire in , he looked overjoyed.He jumped around as he enjoyed the sights and sounds of the aircraft, looked pleased as he was handed a sticker that mum Kate attached to his top and even got to sit in a helicopter.But at one point, it seems the fun got a bit too much for young George and he had to be picked up and comforted by his mum.Maybe it was the noise of the planes that gave him a shock Kateaposs scowl at WilliamAt most public appearances, Kate usually gives nothing away with her facial expressions. But in  she appeared to scowl at husband William while attending a garden party during a tour of Poland.Her demeanour seemed drastically dferent to her beaming smiles and jovial chats to crowds outside Polandaposs Presidential Palace just hours before.Itaposs unclear why she looked gloomy, but according to OK!, George and Charlotte were accompanying their parents on the visit, so maybe tiredness of carrying out a royal tour and looking after two young kids was to blame.Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyQueenPrince William\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Overall . million Brits have recorded a confirmed Covid test but waning immunity from this and vaccines is contributing to rising cases. The UK is recording some of the highest rates of confirmed cases, hospitalisations and deaths in Western Europe after opening up more than others. Some , Brits have now been infected per million of the population compared to an EU average of ,. Spain has , per million, France has , and Germany has ,. Because of the UK’s rapid vaccine rollout many more Brits have now had their second doses at least five months ago. Some % of UK adults passed that point compared to around % in Italy and France. Slow vaccine take-up among younger age groups has also seen Britain fall down international league tables for the overall percentage of the population vaccinated.  Prof Adam Finn, member of the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation , “The really important vaccine doses that we need to give both nationally and internationally are the people who are not yet been immunized. That’s our priority. “Finding a way to immunise such people, including those who are hesitant to receive the new vaccine s for one reason or another, is a very viable and important priority.” Prof Finn, of Bristol University, was presenting trial results of the latest Covid- vaccine by Valneva shown to work. He added: “We’re all drting into a position where we are kind of beginning to talk like the pandemic is done and dusted. That way of thinking is premature.”  Around one in four adults who received their second vaccine dose at least five months ago have still not had a booster jab. The JCVI recommended Brits get third doses at least six months after the first. Around % of UK adults who received their second dose at least six months ago have not had a booster shot. King’s College London’s COVID Symptom Study concluded in August that the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca jab fell from % to % at four to five months after a second dose. The drop off for the Pfizer jab was slightly less at % to %. Israel was one of the few countries ahead of the UK in the initial vaccine rollout and has seen a huge surge in infections in recent months as vaccine protection wanes. The Our World Data comparison project by the John Hopkins University in the US shows Israel also has a high rate of people who have been infected with the virus. Its rate is higher than the UK’s at , per million of the population. The number of UK daily deaths within  days of a positive Covid test dropped to between  and  over the summer.  The latest UK seven-day average for Covid deaths has  people dying each day. Prof Linda Bauld, of University of Edinburgh, told the : “We’re in a phase where we still have large numbers of people dying from this disease. “But it has gone into the background. We’ve become used to something that has not gone away. I think there’s been a desensitisation to the mortality.” Prof Robert West, a behavioural scientist at University College London, said: “There’s some who are of the view that Covid is becoming endemic, it was always going to become endemic and we just need to get on with it. “Then we’ve got another group of scientists saying ‘Look around the world at other countries that won’t tolerate such high rates of infection’”Downing Street acknowledged that winter would be challenging when questioned about rising coronavirus rates.The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We obviously keep very close watch on the latest statistics.Montenegro - ,. Andorra - ,. Georgia - , San Marino - ,. Czech Republic - ,. Serbia - ,. Slovenia - ,. Lithuania - ,. Cyprus - ,. Estonia - ,. *UK - ,. Netherlands - ,. Sweden - ,. Belgium - ,. Spain - ,. France - ,. Portugal - ,. *EU - ,. We always knew the coming months would be challenging. What we are seeing is case rates, hospitalisations and deaths still broadly in line with the modelling as set out a few months back now. The vaccination programme will continue to be our first line of defence, along with new treatments, testing and public health advice. But we will obviously keep a close watch on cases. But it is thanks to our vaccination programme that we are able to substantially break the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths.

Latest figures show the UK is recording more than five times more cases per million people than Germany, and a whopping  times more than Spain.It comes after the Department of Health announced the largest daily rise in coronavirus cases since July  yesterday, with more than , people testing positive in  hours.It has sparked calls for the government to bring in its aposPlan Bapos in England - bringing back compulsory mask wearing indoors, encouraging working from home and introducing controversial vaccine passports.Research by Our World In Data found that in the seven days to Friday, the UK had a rate of . infections per million of the population. This compares to . in Germany, . in Spain, . in Italy and just . in Spain, where stricter coronavirus measures are in place.The UK is also recording more than three times more deaths per million people than Spain, Italy and France, researchers found.  Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the Financial Times that England should immediately be activating” stronger measures.He said: “These small measures like mask-wearing, distancing, ventilation and an emphasis on homeworking are greater than the sum of their parts. “It really doesn’t take an awful lot to bring this down, as France, Italy and others have shown.” Latest Department of Health figures show the number of people testing positive for the virus has risen by more than  per cent in a week. Yesterday , cases were confirmed, bringing the seven day total to ,. Experts have warned that health services could once again be overwhelmed over the winter. In the past seven days there have been  Covid deaths across the UK, an . per cent week-on-week increase. Our World in Data found that the UK has a rate of . deaths per million people, compared to . in Ireland, . in Germany, . in Spain, . in Italy and . in France. More than , people are in hospital with Covid-, of which  were in ventilator beds, the government said yesterday. There were , admissions with the virus in seven days.Earlier today The Mirror reported that experts had warned the Covid booster programme may be moving too slowly to prevent hospitals from becoming overcrowded this winter. Only half of eligible over-s have received a third dose of Covid vaccine one month into the programme, NHS figures suggest. Of the . million people over  who had a second jab more than six months ago, fewer than . million have had the booster. The number of people aged  to  admitted to hospital has risen  per cent in the past week admissions are up  per cent among people over .  Delays to the booster programme will have to be “resolved immediately” to avoid unnecessary pressures on the NHS, said Duncan Robertson, of Warwick University. “Booster vaccinations are there to prevent hospitalisations and ultimately to save lives. Delays matter,” he said. Those who are currently eligible for getting a third dose of the Covid vaccine are people are “most at risk from Covid- who have had a second dose of a vaccine at least six months ago,” according to the NHS. About  million people over the age of  and vulnerable adults will be offered boosters by the end of winter, but at the current rate of , a day, some in their early fties may not have booster jabs until mid-February – about eight months after most received their second dose. Face masks could be made mandatory by law and vaccine passports demanded for nightclubs at a weekaposs notice under a winter ‘Plan B’ unveiled by government last month.Health Secretary Sajid Javid announced Englandaposs Covid Plan A through to March, telling MPs there will be five pillars to keep the virus at bay and avoid another lockdown.They are vaccination and boosters testing, tracing and self-isolation money for the NHS and care general advice like meeting outside or with windows open and wearing face masks in indoor crowded spaces and taking an international approach.

So, what’s going on  Greg Murray, a psychology researcher with expertise in mood, sleep and the circadian system , has explained why this happens.  Professor Murray says: “In a normal night’s sleep, our neurobiology reaches a turning point around  or am. “Core body temperature starts to rise, sleep drive is reducing , secretion of melatoninhas peaked, and levels of cortisolare increasing as the body prepares to launch us into the day.“Remarkably, all this activity happens independent of cues from the environment such as dawn light – nature decided long ago that sunrise and sunset are so important that they must be predicted .“We actually wake up many times each night, and light sleep is more common in the second half of the night. When sleep is going well for us, we are simply unaware of these awakenings. But add a bit of stress and there is a good chance that waking will become a fully self-aware state. “Not surprisingly, there is evidence the pandemic is a sleep-disturbing stressor. Soyou’re experiencing am wakings at the moment, you’re definitely not alone. “Stress also impacts sleep in insomnia, where people become hypervigilant about being awake. “Concerns about being awake when one “should” be asleep can cause the person to jolt themselves into anxious wakefulness whenever they go through a light sleep phase.  “If that sounds like you, be aware that insomnia responds well to psychological treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy. There’s also a strong link between sleep and depression, so it’s important to speak to your doctoryou have any concerns about your sleep.” “As a cognitive therapist, I sometimes joke the only thing good about am waking is that it gives us all a vivid example of catastrophising,” Professor Murray says. “Around this time in the sleep cycle, we’re at our lowest ebb physically and cognitively. From nature’s viewpoint, this is meant to be a time of physical and emotional recovery, so it’s understandable that our internal resources are low. “But we also lack other resources in the middle of the night – social connections, cultural assets, all the coping skills of an adult are unavailable at this time. With none of our human skills and capital, we are left alone in the dark with our thoughts. So the mind is partly right when it concludes the problems it’s generated are unsolvable – at am, most problems literally would be. “Once the sun’s up, we’re listening to the radio, chewing our Vegemite toast and pushing the cat off the bench, and our am problems are put in perspective. We can’t believe the solution of just ringing this person, postponing that thing, or checking such-and-such was overlooked in the wee hours.“The truth is, our mind isn’t really looking for a solution at am. We might think we are problem solving by mentally working over issues at this hour, but this isn’t really problem solving it’s problem solving’s evil twin – worry.“Worry is identying a problem, ruminating about the worst possible outcome and neglecting the resources we would bring to bear should the non-preferred outcome actually occur.” Professor Murray adds: “Have you noticed the am thoughts are very self-focused  In the quiet dark, it’s easy to slide unknowingly into a state of extreme egocentricity. Circling round the concept “I”, we can generate painful backwards-looking feelings like guilt or regret. Or turn our tired thoughts to the always uncertain future, generating baseless fears. “Buddhism has a strong position on this type of mental activity: the self is a fiction, and that fiction is the source of all distress. Many of us now practise Buddhist-informed mindfulness to manage stress in the daytime I use mindfulness to deal with am wakings. “I bring my attention to my senses, specically the sound of my breath. When I notice thoughts arising, I gently bring my attention back to the sound of breathing . “Sometimes this meditation works. Sometimes it doesn’t. If I’m still caught in negative thinking after  or  minutes, I follow the advice from cognitive behavioural therapy, and get up, turn on dim light and read. “This action may seem mundane, but at am it is powerfully compassionate, and can help draw you out of your unproductive thinking. “One last tip: It’s important to convince yourselfthat you want to avoid catastrophic thinking. For good reasons not to worry, you can’t go past the Stoic philosophers. “Waking and worrying at am is very understandable and very human. But in my opinion, not a great habit to get into.” Comment MORE ON Mental healthInsomniaTherapySleep\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Nicola published the footage online, some people told her to contact the police to report the incident. She said she contacted Merseyside Police but is now terried of leaving the house alone with her dogs in case there are attempts to steal them.  Nicola said: I had just popped out with my son and could see on my phone they were at the door so I got home as quickly as possible and then I watched the video. Our front door has glass and you can see straight through, when Iaposm in we have the curtain closed over it but thataposs dficult to do as youaposre going out of the door. The man rang our normal doorbell not the ring bell and you can see the dogs are going mental. When I watched it at first I didnapost realise what heaposd said, but then I watched it again. One of our dogs is a fluffy white thing and you can see him look in the direction of the kitchen and say apospomeranianapos and write it down. I have no idea why he said it out loud like there. Itaposs not a Pomeranian but I suppose it could look a bit like one. She said that after posting the footage on the Crimewatch Wirral group, some locals said they had witnessed similar incidents before. The woman added: When I rang the police and they were really helpful and apparently there were a few reports of dogs being targeted in this way. A lady who lives up the road said someone she knew had that happen to her and now Iaposm petried of leaving them in the house. Iaposm scared to go for a walk with them in the dark on my own and wonapost do that now. Iaposm worried now about what will happen. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said: We were contacted at .pm on Thursday th October, by a resident of Frankby Road in West Kirby following reports that  minutes earlier a man had been seen on her Ring doorbell looking through her door and window. The male left a short time later. There is no suggestion he attempted to enter the property. Local policing officers have been made aware.

The restaurant chain, known for the tight-fitting unorms worn by its female staff, has now said it will allow employees to “choose” which unorm they wish to wear.In a statement to Insider, a spokesperson for Hooters said: “As we continue to listen and update the image of the Hooters Girls, we are clarying that they have the option to choose from traditional unorms or the new ones.They can determine which style of shorts best fits their body style and personal image. It followed its previous decision to replace already-short shorts for new skin-tight, bikini-cut bottoms, which some of its staff compared to underwear.  A series of viral TikTok videos shared by Hooters staff show employees speaking out against the shorts while others have threatened to quit as a result of the unorm change. “Oh look, a wedgie!” Hooters employee and medical student Kristen Songer, , said as she revealed the new shorts. “This is why all the Hooters girls are upset — because this is not what I agreed to wear a year ago when I was hired.”  In another video, one person compared the two shorts with the caption: “Love my job but don’t love wearing undies to work.” Another TikTok user said: “Soooo Hooters got new panties. I mean shorts.” The unorm change did receive positive feedback from some staff, one who said she was obsessed with the shorts while another asked Am I the only Hootie that loves the new shorts    “I’ve been making way more money with the new shorts,” a third said. Hooters has repeatedly come under fire for promoting the objectication of women through mandatory barely-there unorms, as well as staff beauty pageants and girl calendars.  The bar and restaurant chain launched in  with a unique selling point serving staff made up entirely of attractive, young women wearing orange hotpants and tight tops. Hooters of America, the franchisor and operator of Hooters restaurants, operates more than  franchise locations across  states and  countries. The company’s spokesperson added that the shorts were “the result of a collaboration with Hooters Girls and have been worn for months in several Texas markets with overwhelmingly positive feedback”. They said that Hooters appreciates the feedback, both positive and negative, regarding a more accommodating and inclusive image policy on tattoos, jewelry, nails, hairstyles as well as new unorm options — to include new top styles, shorts, and the addition of socks. The company said it plans to continue to work with employees and give them opportunities for providing input at every stage including future clothing items and accessories. Weaposre excited to see a national trend toward self-expression and inclusivity that bodes well for our marketplace, the spokesperson continued.

A -year-old groom kicked out a number of his female family members from his wedding after they turned up in white dresses.He took to Reddit to share his story, where he explained: I have a large family. Mostly aunts and female cousins aside from mum, stepmum, stepsister, and grandmother.I donapost know how to say this but all those women I mentioned above are into teasing and joking. Theyaposve formed a unitand theyaposd tease and roast every new woman that enters the family by marriage by setting up apostestsapos to seethey deserve to be part of the family. Or roast their looks and styles to the point of breaking confidence and self-esteem down. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Then after a few months of teasing, theyaposd announce that theyaposve finally welcomed them into the family. The newest member would join in on the teasing too which is crazy as my dad says. Sadly, the same happened to his we. When I first introduced my then-girlfriend now we, I made it clear that I didnapost want any of the women in the unit to come at her or harass her not even with a single word, he said.They went behind my back and roasted her looks and job and I discovered theyaposve been doing it on Facebook. I had them apologise one by one after they gave the aposweaposre just testing the water to seesheaposs capable to be part of the familyapos excuse.They didnapost want to apologise but once I said I wouldnapost invite any of the unit unless they apologise, including my mum, everyone immediately apologised and brought gts for my we. First of them was my stepmum and my sister-in-law. But as the couple made plans to get married, he learned that there was talk about the women in the family wanting to pull a prank on my we by wearing white and called it the aposultimate testapos to see how my we react.  My brother warned me so I announced thatany one of them showed up in white Iaposd have them kicked out including mum. They said this wasnapost true and theyaposd never do such a thing. But they showed up to my wedding one by one wearing white dresses and each and every one of them was told to leave after they tried giving excuses by either making scenes or getting the men involved. The senior women of the unit, who are mum and aunts, also showed up in white but refused to leave. I threatened to take harsher action and mum was p***ed telling me to step aside but I didnapost let her in. I had her leave while the men in the family were watching stunned, dad was on my side and supported me a lot. I felt absolutely awful because my wedding was being interrupted by them making scenes. My we was hurt beyond measure but the women in the family were pissed. My cousin blasted me on social media later saying I excluded all the women from the wedding because my we was so insecure she couldnapost handle another womanaposs presence at her wedding. I had an argument with them and mum berated me saying it was supposed to be a prank but I said they were taking it too far. Mum said I took it too far by kicking them out because they were trying to get a reaction from my we to seeshe was one of those aposbridezillasapos and were going to change soon as the prank was over but I ruined my own and entire wedding by reacting so aggressively. I stopped talking after she said I had to bring my we and apologise. I havenapost seen the lot of them in two weeks and theyaposve excluded me from everything. He concluded his post by asking users whether he was in the wrong for how he handled the situation but many people said he did the right thing by standing up for his we. One person said: Your family is toxic and I am so sad for your we that they would do that, but also so happy for her that she has a husband who will support her and have her back. Iaposm sorry your family tried to hijack your wedding for a power play, but you did the right thing, and your marriage will be stronger because of it. Another commented: A prank is only a prankeveryone ends up laughing. Otherwise, itaposs just bullying. A third wrote: I am shuddering at the thought of any woman having to marry into a family like that, but having [original poster] for a husband is definitely a silver lining.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

In the now-viral clip, she said: Today I want to talk to you about a role which you donapost need a degree to do and even with two-plus years of experience, you can be looking at salaries of £, plus, and thataposs on the lower end.The role is a product data analyst.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Itaposs a pretty new role in the market so tech companies will be fighting over you because there arenapost that many people doing this job right now.What youaposre basically doing is youaposre normally working for some sort of app or  where you are basically analysing the success of the product.Eleni has had recent success in hiring people for roles like this one, having found a new candidate just a few weeks ago.I hired one two weeks ago, she revealed. The skills someone needs really y – thataposs the beauty of the role.I think you could come into it from all sorts of backgrounds.The main thing you need is a passion for making apps more efficient and improving the product, experience with analysis. Although you donapost necessarily need a degree, to help improve your chances of snagging a job in these rare fields, Eleni recommends up-skilling with online courses. She said: You donapost need a degree because itaposs not a typical analyst role, and you need to be comfortable speaking to senior stakeholders.Your role will be to find areas where the app is not working for users, and then take this to senior leadership and tell them how they need to change it.Being an analyst isnapost the only role Eleni suggests looking out foryou want a career but think you donapost have the right qualications – other jobs include positions in product management, UX design and more. She said: Every role requires some experience in a transferable skill of course, but I would say tech scale-ups are a particularly great sector to get into. They need the skill and theyaposre competing against other tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon etc., so generally speaking, find it dficult to find the right people – which is where you could come in and make a great contribution. There are loads of roles you could do with just up-skilling through online courses and then getting exposure to the right areas, no degree needed – product management, UX design, product design, marketing analytics.  If youaposve been struggling to get a job during summer, now is the optimal time to get those CVs sent out.Eleni said: The market has pretty much been flipped on its head compared to last year.Companies are trying to backfill from hires that they were supposed to make in , but they couldnapost afford to because of the pandemic, alongside playing catch up for their growth plans for , so itaposs a great time to start something new.And when it comes to tips for searching for a new job, she added: If youaposre struggling to find something right now, widen your horizons to what youaposre looking for.I find so many of us donapost know about the opportunities and types of roles that there are out there for us.I come across roles all the time where Iaposm like someone actually gets paid to do that   How amazing!So Iaposd just say thereaposs a job out there for nearly everything you could think of, donapost give up.Some people doing similar roles commented on the post to give their thoughts. One said: Iaposve had this role and hired for it - If you see a degree on the requirements for a job, apply anyway! they just donapost know what to put on the spec.Another added: Analyst here. Can confirm that u donapost need a degree. Good to be proficient in sheets SQL or google analytics etc. tho. but u can learn those easy. [sic]Someone  wrote: No tech degree and work as a tech business analyst. My new role wanted an SQL expert but instead, theyaposre paying me gt£k to learn it on the job.A fourth said: Product Analyst here, previous experience was customer service and operational teams. Proof you can get into the role without previous experience.Another person wrote: Iaposm a product data analyst and I have a degree in Musical Theatre.

Businesswoman Zoe Johnson was stunned when a message arrived in her LinkedIn inbox breaking the bad news. It said: Hi Zoe, Thanks for reaching out, but I’m not interested.” But Zoe, , was not too disappointed by the snub - as sheaposs started her own skincare business since applying for the role. She said: “It was quite to the point and I thought saying ‘thanks I wasn’t waiting on it’. “It was just funny - because when you send the message on LinkedIn they can accept or reject it.

He alerted the Israel Antiquities Authority, which confirmed the sword belonged to a Crusader knightThe sword is believed to have belonged to a Crusader who sailed to the Holy Land almost a millennium ago Image: REUTERSByChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct | commentsAn amateur scuba er has found a -year-old Crusader sword off Israelaposs coast, the countryaposs Antiquities Authority has announced. Shlomi Katzin made the discovery while scuba ing about  metres out to sea at the weekend. He noticed several remains including pottery fragments, stone and metal anchors, as well as the blade. He decided to bring it up to the surface as he was worried the precious object might get covered by the sand. Mr Katzin then alerted the Israel Antiquities Authority , which confirmed the sword belonged to a Crusader knight. IAA’s Robbery Prevention Unit Inspector Nir Distelfeld said: The sword, which has been preserved in perfect condition, is a beautul and rare find and evidently belonged to a Crusader knight.  It was found encrusted with marine organisms but is apparently made of iron. It is exciting to encounter such a personal object, taking you  years back in time to a dferent era, with knights, armor and swords. The sword was buried at a shallow depth of about four or five metres in an area regularly frequented by ers, Mr Katzin said. It has a metre-long blade and a -centimeter hilt, archaeologists have explained.  Kobi Sharvit, head of the authority’s marine archaeology unit, said: The shape and, of course, the location leave no doubt that it is of Crusader provenance. We have only started now to carefully work on clearing away the sediment and then we’ll x-ray it and hopefully we’ll be able to work out whether it was manufactured locally or brought over by one of the Crusaders. We may even find on the hilt or blade some markings that will allow us to discover some clues as to the owner and which Crusader order he belonged to and which crusade he was on.  After handing over the sword, the scuba er received a certicate of appreciation for good citizenship, according to reports. The First Crusade was the first of a series of religious wars and took place from  to . Christian knights from Europe captured Jerusalem where they began massacring the cityaposs Muslim and Jewish population. They also established mini-kingdoms in the area, with some ruins still visible in Israel today. There is a possibility that the sword found by Mr Katzin on Saturday had fallen from a ship or was on a ship that was wrecked there. Mr Sharvit said it is rare to find artacts like the sword, but probably thanks to a recent storm the sand moved and now several objects from dferent periods are emerging.

He called his neighbour who came over with some bear sprayThe family was shocked to find a huge black bear standing up at a desk in a bedroom Image: Sean ReddyByPeter BarkerChiara Fiorillo:,  Oct | commentsA dad has captured the moment a -stone bear broke into his house and sat on his sonaposs gaming chair. Sean Reddy said a black bear entered his property through an open bedroom window on October . He said he was cleaning up his garden because a bear had made a mess after knocking over the bins the night before. But as he walked around his garden in Alberta, Canada, his two dogs suddenly became very agitated. Sean said he recognised the dogsapos behaviour as they displayed it before when there was a bear nearby. The dogs soon had the bear cornered near the garage, but Sean shouted at them to back off as the animal could have seriously injured them.  He said: The bear did not seem too fazed by my dogs and I was yelling at them to call them back so as not to get killed by the bear. I locked them [the dogs] in my shop and closed the door to leave the bear alone. The bear then made its way into the garage where it got its paws on dog food and some items in the freezer. Sean told his children, Ronan and Cormac, to stay inside and not go anywhere near the garage as the bear was there. The family watched the bear from their window and assumed that after finishing the food it would head back into the woods. However, just minutes later -year-old Cormac asked his dad what all the scratching he could hear coming from the other end of the house was. Ronan then shouted to his dad, saying the bear was now in the hallway. The dad said: I went in to see and sure enough there it was. I donapost remember what I said orI was yelling at the bear, but thataposs when he walked into Cormacaposs room.  Sean thought a window was open in the room so he shut the door and hoped that the bear would leave the same way it came in. He rushed outside to checkthe window really was open only to find that it was shut. He said: Now just realising that I had locked the bear in Cormacaposs room, I ran back into the house to see and went down the hallway to find out my son Liam had left his bedroom window wide open and thataposs where the bear had come in. Sean said the bear had climbed through Liamaposs room, across his bed, and then wandered through the house to Cormacaposs room. He added: I wasnapost sure what to do, thinking the bear was going to be p****d off at me for being locked in the room.  With Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Fish and Wildle officials unreachable, Sean was left to his own devices when it came to removing the bear from his sonaposs bedroom. He called his neighbour Chris who came over with some anti-bear spray. Sean said: We decided to get a bunch of furniture ready to block off the hallway, there is a bookshelf by Cormacaposs bedroom which I had pulled back thinking at leastI opened up the door and a mad bear was coming out I had a bookshelf between us. However, when he opened the bedroom door the bear did not show itself. Sean explained: I climbed over the small bookshelf to look in, and the bear was at the computer desk looking back at me asto say aposwhat do you want apos He added: Thataposs when I said to the guys here aposI have to take a picture because no one will believe me!apos The bear walked across the hallway back towards the bedroom and left shortly after Sean took the picture of it by his sonaposs gaming chair. The bear has not been seen since, but Sean says that bear sightings are not uncommon near the familyaposs home although normally they keep to the garden and the garage.

Tens of thousands of dissidents and political prisoners are reportedly harvested in China every year as part of a barbaric black market operation led by the Chinese governmentA Falun Gong follower displays torture methods they claim Chinese authorities used against their members in China Image: ReutersByAlex BellottiNews Features Writer:,  Oct | commentsCalled to a remote hillside on a hot summeraposs day, Dr Enver Tothi felt a chill down his spine as gunshots rang out across the fields. Walking his team over the summit, the medical expert was greeted by the sight of up to  men wearing prisonersapos unorms collapsed leless on the ground. Their heads had been blown off by military police who stood over twitching corpses - the job of Dr Tothi was to harvest fresh organs, which have become a valuable commodity on the Chinese black market. The horric scenes may sound eerily similarly to the side plot in Netflixaposs smash hit drama Squid Game, but the gruesome practice is all too real.Human rights groups in China claim the government is operating an organ-trafficking network that harvests as many as , dissidents and political prisoners every year.Hearts, kidneys, livers and even corneas are all removed on an industrial scale, campaigners say - while those involved have revealed grim secrets of witnessing the barbaric scenes first-hand. Organs aposharvestedapos like in Netflix hit Since its release last month, Squid Game has quickly become the most-viewed international show in Netflixaposs history. The creepy South Korean thriller sees desperate contestants battle it out in childhood-inspired games to win millions of pounds - the catch being thatthey fail, they die. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersWhile the far-fetched premise thankfully isnapost inspired by real le, a side plot sees workers for the aposgameapos dragging off injured participants to harvest their organs and sell them off. Just months before the showaposs release, UN human rights experts warned they were extremely alarmed by reports of alleged organ harvesting in real le. Minorities including followers of the religious movement Falun Gong, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims and Christians are being targeted in detention in China, the reports claim. The UN experts say they have received credible information that detainees are being mysteriously subjected to blood tests and organ examinations such as ultrasound and x-rays - without consent. “Forced organ harvesting in China appears to be targeting specic ethnic, linguistic or religious minorities held in detention, often without being explained the reasons for arrest or given arrest warrants, at dferent locations,” they said. “We are deeply concerned by reports of discriminatory treatment of the prisoners or detainees based on their ethnicity and religion or belief. “According to the allegations received, the most common organs removed from the prisoners are reportedly hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas and, less commonly, parts of livers. This form of trafficking with a medical nature allegedly involves health sector professionals, including surgeons, anaesthetists and other medical specialists.”  China is facing a huge shortage of organs that can be used for transplants, but under controversial rules recipients can book surgeries for specic dates and locations. This doesnapost happen in other countriesapos systems, as surgeons cannot predict when a potential donor will die. Under Chinaaposs rules, the donoraposs organs will be sent to the most urgent patient on a waiting list who is within travelling distance. This has allowed the country to establish a horric aposkill to orderapos system, but despite widespread condemnation, Beijing has been able to cover it up by under-reporting transplant figures to the World Health Organisation.A recent statistical analysis of Chinaaposs current organ transplant system showed the numbers China has been putting out have been falsied, Susie Hughes, executive director of The International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China, told Daily Mail Australia.When you examine hospital revenues, bed utilisation rates and the number of surgical teams from the official Chinese data... the figure is more likely to be between , to , transplants per year. aposI became a robot... you carry out what you are programmed toapos China has persecuted a number of minority groups over the years, with thousands of Falun Gong detained as religious prisoners around the turn of the century. In , human rights lawyers began campaigning on the issue of organ harvesting, but  years later, little has been done to curb the sickening practice.  While the Falun Gong were once the target of the authorities, following its effective dissolution as a movement the Uighur - an ethnic group of Muslims now largely situated in the north-west of China - became the new scapegoat.Last year, the China Tribunal published a landmark  page report after  months of investigation into organ harvesting in the country. Dr Tothi - who now works as a London Uber driver - contributed to the enquiry, having been forced to remove a prisoners organs while working as a doctor in .I became a robot, the father-of-three told MirrorOnline. You carry out what you are programmed to do. When I cut through there was bleeding, which means the heart was still beating. I understood why. This man was shot to the right chest. They knocked him out but did not let him die immediately so I had time to remove the organs.  It was an easy and quick operation which took  to  minutes. Even less because it’s a destructive operation. The chief surgeon put the organs in a box and said aposnow you take your team back to hospital, and today nothing happenedapos. When Dr Tothi was made to carry out the brutal surgery, the Chinese Communist Party was concerned with the Falun Gong - a religious group that top brass considered to be a grave threat to their authority. The identity of the man he was forced to operate on, without anesthetic, remains a mystery to him. Prisoner x-rayed at horric concentration camp Tens of thousands of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience are thought to have been killed so that their organs could be sold in the lucrative black market.Among the lucky survivors was Jenner Zeng, who was saved from having her innards plundered by a chance admission to a prison guard. For  hours a day the mum-of-one was forced to stand in the sun and recite regulations at a prison camp in Beijing until she fainted, at which point a guard would shock her awake with an electric batton. Itaposs very sad, because we failed to stop them when they did this to Falun Gong, Ms Zeng toldof the state-run programme of forced organ harvesting. The western world funded this persecution by investing in China. Thenow has the power to expand this mass murder to Uighur and the people of Hong Kong. During her time in the camp Ms Zeng was taken to a medical facility where she had her eyes tested and her organs touched. She explained to the doctor that she had been infected with hepatitis C during a blood transfusion after giving birth, but had been cured of it in the process of practising Falun Gong. A month later she and several thousand inmates were taken in shackles in large buses with their windows blacked out to a hospital where they were x-rayed. At a smaller clinic back at the camp their blood was taken without explanation. It was only after her release that Ms Zeng learned that the authorities had been removing the organs of prisoners to be sold to wealthy and powerful people, from China and from overseas. Only at that stage, I realised what a narrow escape I had, she explained.  If I had not told the doctor I had had hepatitis C, I could have become a victim as well. From my first dayI had a strange feeling. Is this real  Have I been sent to the concentration camps in the history books  Could this be happening in the st century  We read about it in the history books but it doesnapost happen anymore. I had been transferred to the Nazi concentration camps. That kind of feeling haunted me for a long time. aposMy name is the butcher... itaposs like slaughtering pigsapos Also included in the  report is a transcript of a telephone call between an investigator and Zhu Jiabin, who admits to murdering and harvesting the organs of Gao Yixi in . Asked about the harvesting, Jiabin says: Sold them!’ After slaughtering and opening up the belly, you just carve out the organs and sell them. I only know to sell organs for money after organ harvesting. That is my principle... If you had guts to stand in front of me now I would live organ harvest you... My name is ‘the butcher’... I am called the butcher specialising in live organ harvesting... Itaposs nothing, just like slaughtering pigs. You come over to shave their hair first and then split open the belly. I would carve out whatever I need. After scooping the organs out, I would sell them.Last year, a group of doctors were found to have harvested the organs of car crash victims and then sold them for cash.Six people, including four doctors, were jailed in China having been caught up in the countryaposs thriving organ black market. It followed growing reports that the country was executing Muslim prisoners and taking their organs to treat patients dying of Covid-. Concerns were raised after Beijing boasted about a successful double transplant operation on a patient given just days to live. Human rights groups questioned how the -year-oldaposs two matched lungs were found in a matter of days.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON Squid GameNetflixChinese Communist PartyFalun Gong\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

and perhaps fancul # as it did back in .Aberdonians at the time were reported to be #unfriendly# towards the prospect of trams in the Granite City and dismissed them as #a Yankee invention#.Typically suspicious and dour, few city folk had ever seen a tram and didn#t believe enough people would use them to cover the costs of installing them, in fact they asked: #What is the use of trams #But despite the general reluctance, city businessmen pressed on regardless, and trams were first approved for Aberdeen in .However, a labour and iron shortage meant work couldn#t begin until April .It took just four months from the breaking of the ground to the opening of the network on August   to construct Aberdeen#s horse-drawn tramway.Initially, the totalof the line constructed was three miles for running six tramcars, pulled by a fleet of  horses.The first route took passengers from Queen#s Cross, where the tram depot was, to Kittybrewster via Union Street and St Nicholas Street.And the second, from Queen#s Cross to the North Churchon King Street via Union Street and Castle Street.The line was described as being #extremely smooth# a feature #peculiar# to the Aberdeen tramway, due to the innovative way in which the sleepers were laid.The trams ran every  minutes from am to pm, and the fare from Queen#s Cross to Kittybrewster was a mere three pence.At a cost of just £, for the whole network, six tramcars,  horses, stables big enough to house  horses, harnesses and the depot, the tramway was considered a financial triumph.The opening ceremony was an opportunity for the businessmen to prove Aberdonians wrong.Aberdeen Tramways secretary Mr McKinnon said: #Now that you have got tramway  -what is the use of them #To the man of business, to whom time is money, their use is evident.#Besides saving time to him, they give him facilities for accomplishing business engagements at places considering remote from each other, and theyhim to his counting house or office, free from the heat, cold, or wet of a iable climate.#To ladies and children and others they afford an exit from town to country, where they can inhale health from pure air and clear skies.#Look what a convenience they offer ladies shopping and to servants going to market.#To workmen going to and from their work, or to and from their meals.#In short, there is not class or party to whom they are not beneficial.#This simplied version of the Aberdeen tram network reimagined in the style of the London Underground route diagram shows the true extent of how the trams connected Aberdeen and its suburbs.Aberdonians were indeed proved wrong. Predictions that the rails would be lted within two years were unfounded, and in , the tramway system was extended.Firstly to the new housing development at Mannofield, then the route on King Street was ened and a connection was made to Woodside.A tramway through Rosemount was made possible in  after the construction of the Rosemount Viaduct and in , extensions were completed to Bridge of Dee and Bridge of Don.Affluent Aberdonians had long since vacated the stour of the city centre and its growing industries, instead settling in large villas on the outskirts.The wealthy made good use of the tram network, but despite claims the tramway would be classless, often the only working class people on board were the driver and crew.It was only when the town council took ownership of the network in , becoming Aberdeen Corporation Tramways, that it became a more universal mode of transport bridging social classes.Under the city council the trams became electried early in the new century and extensions were made to Ferryhill and Torry.The final major extension to the network was made in  after a revamp of the whole system, when the line was taken to Hazlehead.Aberdeen#s trams were famously torched in  when their usage became usurped by the rise in family motor cars and buses.Despite the initial reluctance in Aberdeen over the introduction of trams in the first place, many Aberdonians were up in arms over their destruction, although other felt they had had their day.And now,  years later it would seem the prospect of trams on the city#s streets has once again ided opinion.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine What is the uptake like during pregnancy The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.There is limited data available on vaccinations in pregnancy, however we do have monthly data on the number of people vaccinated by pregnancy trimester.Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland # track the spread with these charts# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-track-the-spread-in-these-charts-and-maps embed # secretanuYMBbtv\" data-secret\"anuYMBbtv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics\" title\"#Coronavirus in Scotland – here are the key demographics# # Evening Express\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news specials coronavirus-in-scotland-here-are-the-key-demographics embed # secretbLHWrhpUp\" data-secret\"bLHWrhpUp\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Let us knowthere is something  you think we should be tracking by emailing lkelly@dctmediaFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/07/shutterstock_222952348-e1634588570877-300x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/07/shutterstock_222952348-e1634588570877-620x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/07/shutterstock_222952348-e1634588570877-940x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/07/shutterstock_222952348-e1634588570877-300x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"rugby aberdeen grammar must pick up win against fellow premiership strugglers gordonians roar back to form","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen Grammar must score at least one win from their next two Premiership games, where they will face fellow relegation battlers GHA and Selkirk.The north-east side went down - to Currie at Malleny Park on Saturday.Despite losing their first six games this season # conceding  tries in the process # Grammar captain Tom Aplin believes his beleaguered team can bounce back to beat GHA on Saturday, and follow it up with a win in the Borders at Selkirk.However, Grammar#s two rivals will also view the meetings as a chance to add much-needed victories.Aplin said: “We need to work on our defence, while our set-pieces are not working, but # with guys coming back from injury # I still believe the spirit is there to enable us to bounce back.#When we have ball in hand we look good. We scored two good tries against title-chasing Currie, but unfortunately leaked six, something we will be addressing in training next week.#The Grammar line-out was a shambles, while, once again, ill discipline cost them dearly as Glen Robertson, their busy, hard-tackling flanker fell foul of the referee as early as the th minute, resulting in him spending  minutes in the sin bin.Full-back Ross Cameron also had a good game, while stand-off Sam Knudson, with better ball, might have caused Currie more problems.But overall Grammar were well beaten by half-time, trailing -.Grammar’s tries came from scrum-half Ali Addy and replacement lock Patrick Mullholland, with both converted by Aplin.Across the road at Countesswells, there was better news for Gordonians, who raged back to form with an impressive - win at the expense of bottom side Whitecraigs to move out of the National League  relegation area.It was a result which delighted their three-try captain Danny Usugo.“We were firing on all cylinders, right from the start. This young team with an average age of less than  are learning with every game,” said Usugo.Gordonians led - at the break on the back of four tries, adding a further five # three of which were converted by stand-off Alex Fraser, who missed six kicks at goal, but otherwise led his line with authority.The other try scorers for the home side were Chris McIroy, Jared White, Callum Stephen ,  Tom Williams and Emmett Strachan.Gordonians travel to the Borders next, where they will have a much tougher test against Peebles.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowInsects are tiny creatures, but they make a massive contribution in keeping our world in balance.They are responsible for the pollination of about  per cent of trees and bushes on the entire planet. Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise.

lead at half time.Star looked to put the game to bed as quickly as possible in the second half and did so as Aaron Moore grabbed his second of the afternoon following a slip from the Duncanrig keeper.MacLean was next to double his tally as he proved too sharp for the Duncanrig defence and finished well from a tight angle to make the score - with half an hour to go.This gave manager Weir the chance to ring the changes, with Ryan Caskie coming on to replace Aaron Moore and helping himself to two goals of his own from close range to make the final score -.The only sour note was an injury to goal-scoring substitute Caskie which will rule him out of Star#s next game.Star look to make it back-to-back wins on Saturday October , again on their travels to Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"art and smarten up for tarbert thrift shop","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThanks to a shop front improvement grant from Argyll and Bute Council, the Tarbert Church of Scotland was able to spruce up its charity shop in the village.The  per cent grant helped towards the cost of painting and erecting new signs at the thrt shop with a specially-commissioned painting of Tarbert with the prominent church and a Church of Scotland emblem.The painting is the remarkable work of talented Tarbert artist Matthew Manao, who studied fine art at Glasgow School of Art, and it makes the perfect connection between the thrt shop to the church.The thrt shop provides a major part of the income for the church and has been a leline to keeping the church going for many years.It has helped provide funds for disabled access to the church through the sale of merchandise with images gted to the church by prominent Mid Argyll artist Jolomo, the late John Leckie and Molly Smith, supported by monetary donations and by the sale of #virtual# bricks.Lisa MacFarlane of Tarbert church said: #We are grateful for the support of the community and the many visitors to Tarbert.#Feel free to join the Church of Scotland in Tarbert, Kilberry and Skipness Facebook page for updates on the church and thrt shop.#The shop front improvement grant utilises Scottish Government Town Centre Funding  with the aim of supporting the local economy by providing employment for tradespeople while helping towns become more attractive places to live, work, visit and invest."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures october 15 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLike a scene from the heyday of Para Handy and the Clyde puffers, the VIC makes her sedate way from Crinan towards Bellanoch Bridge.Lochgilphead reader Rhona Young kindly sent us her photograph, taken on Saturday October  as the Vic was travelling on the Crinan Canal en route to Cairnbaan."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-day-cross-country-running-borders","story":"THE SCOTTISH Athletics East District Cross Country relays took place in Galashiels on Saturday.Lasswade AC took the senior womenrsquos gold medals thanks to the trio of Amy Smith, Sarah Tait and Amy Frankland.Taitrsquos second leg run was influential in Lasswadersquos win and her time of : over a hilly course at Gala Academy was enough to take the fastest lap title by two seconds from Holly Page .Edinburgh Uni Hare and Hounds took the silver and bronze medals in that race with the surprise being that it was their lsquoCrsquo team who were second with the lsquoArsquo team in third.Just for good measure, the students from Edinburgh were also fourth and fth in an impressive collective performance for the Hare and Hounds.Central won the menrsquos race thanks to the efforts of Calum Phillip, Ben Macmillan, Luca Fonottoli and Hamish Hickey.Edinburgh Uni were second here, too, with Aberdeen AAC coming home third for the bronzes.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers.

from trick or treating and other Scottish Halloween traditions.What does guising mean Guising derives from the word disguise, and is based on the notion that people dress up at Halloween.Children dress up and go from house to house, telling jokes and stories or singing songs in exchange for sweeties and food.The Collins dictionary defines guising as \"the practice orcustomofdisguisingoneself infancydress, often with amask, andvisitingpeoples houses, especially atHalloween\".According to folklore, children dressed up so they could venture out safely without wicked ghouls detecting them.Homeowners may leave pumpkins or decorations outside their houses to indicate they are welcoming guisers.Is guising dferent to trick or treating Yes, guising is dferent to trick or treating.Traditionally, guising requires you to tell a story or a joke or sing a song, while trick or treating simply requires going up to doors and calling \"trick or treat\".Treat usually refers to a sweetie or food item, while trick refers to thethreat ofa trick being played on homeownersthey dont offer a treat.What other Scottish Halloween traditions take place There are a few moreScottish Halloween traditions aside form guising.Before pumpkin carving became the done thing, Scots traditionally carved turnips instead and filled them with candles.Apple dookin is also a Scottish tradition people have to get apples out of a basin of water using just their mouths.Alternatively, people hold forks in their mouths and drop them from a distance in an attempt to stab an apple.Another tradition was especially for newly engaged couples the couple would each burn a nut on the fire andthe nuts burned quietly a happy union lay ahead, whilethey crackled and hissed there was more likely a turbulent future.A game that has been modernised is treacle scones - back in the day, people used to try to eat scones suspended with strings without using their hands.Nowadays, this game tends to be played using donuts."},{"url":null,"title":"black-friday-2021-black-friday-year-uk---date-time","story":"Black Friday has become a part of UK culture in recent years, with the flash sales viewed as

forest, of course, but a very small strip of ancient woodland, east of Innerwick, that clings to the steep slopes of the glen by Crowhill. The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"home-bargains-open-haddington-retail-park-weekend-55-new-jobs","story":"The national chain is the latest retailer to open in Haddington Retail Park, with the new shop officially opening its doors for the first time on Saturday at am.Already, Costa Coffee, The Food Warehouse and Aldi are welcoming customers on the townrsquos western edge.Ahead of the opening, Home Bargains also confirmed it would be making a pound, donation to Haddington-based good cause the Lammermuir Larder.Magdalena Cosgrove, the new Home Bargains store manager at Haddington Retail Park, was looking forward to welcoming customers this weekend.She said: ldquoIrsquove worked in the retail sector for many years, but therersquos nothing quite like the buzz of opening a new store.ldquoFour years ago, I helped launch our Craigmillar Shopping Centre site, so I know how much hard work and dedication goes into something like this.ldquoI canrsquot wait to open the store this weekend alongside such a fantastic team ndash itrsquos something that Irsquom exceptionally proud of.The more than ,-square-foot store will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.Pat Lemmon, founder of the Lammermuir Larder, welcomed the four-figure donation.The volunteer-led food initiative provides people in need with a weekrsquos shopping, fresh fruit and vegetables, and a meat voucher.Mrs Lemmon, who is also a member of the townrsquos community council, said: ldquoWe are over the moon to be picked as the local group to benefit from this wonderful donation from Home Bargains.ldquoThis money will go a long way in helping many people in the Haddington and Lammermuir area who are currently struggling financially and worried about putting food on the table.A petrol station is also planned for the retail park, with one remaining unit yet to be filled."},{"url":null,"title":"gas-works-see-road-closures-prestonpans-13-weeks","story":"SGN announced that it would begin work to upgrade its gas network in the Prestonpans area on Monday.The work involves replacing ,m of old metal gas mains and service pipes with new plastic pipe, ensuring a continued safe and reliable gas supply to the local community.SGN has planned its work in close consultation with local authorities to reduce disruption as much as possible.The project will be carried out by SGN contractor George Ritchie  Son.During the works, parking restrictions will be in operation allowing safe access to the pipe ndash some road closures will also be required.Temporary traffic signals will be in operation at certain times, which may cause delays during peak periods.Emergency vehicle access will be maintained throughout the work.The gas work will be suspended during the Christmas holidays, with operatives ing early in the new year.Road closures include Prestongrange Terracersquos junction with Prestongrange Road, and Polwarth Terracersquos junction with Gardiner Terrace.To minimise disruption, SGN work will be carried out on a phased basis and not all streets will be affected at the same time.Access to driveways and garages will be maintained unless previously agreed with the occupier.An SGN spokesperson said: ldquoWersquoll be working as quickly as possible to complete our work and will be making every effort to minimise inconvenience to the local community.Suspension of parking is as follows:Prestonpans Community Council is calling for greater clarity on road works in and around the town, ideally in the form of an interactive map showing all the restrictions over time.A spokesperson for the community council said: ldquoInidual roadworks are obviously necessary for the maintenance of our public utilities.ldquoHowever, there is a balance to be struck between maintenance and what can quickly become a public nuisance.ldquoIf roadworks are all planned to minimise distribution, there is currently no way of telling.

As in that political satire, the swearing in Succession has been raised to an art form.Characters are brutal towards each other, but since they are all such horrible people with zip in the way of redeeming qualities we do not carethe worst happens to them. Itrsquos gladiators v gladiators out there, not lions v Christians.Just as in The Thick of It, the cast are so comfortable with each other, and the writing so slick, the drama moves like a well-oiled farce.The actors donrsquot need to fight over the juiciest lines because there are enough for everybody. Where other comedy-dramas might have a miserly handful of zingers, the multiple Emmy-winning Succession throws them around like confetti.In an ensemble as good as this, it should be dficult to choose a favourite, but who are we ******* kidding here  Brian Coxrsquos swearmaster-in-chief commands every scene he is in.Logan, one of the most fascinating TV characters in years, is a charming psychopath who long ago wearied of the charming part of the deal.He is, as cousin Greg likes to say, ldquoall killer, no filler, a man who has clawed his way out of poverty in Scotland , a modern day robber baron who thinks tough love is the only kind that will equip his children to survive in this rotten world .Courtesy of Cox, Logan can make Daniel Day-Lewisrsquos oilman in There Will Be Blood look like Santa.The third series opener could have been a stop-start affair aiming to pick up new viewers who have heard the buzz about Succession and fancy seeing what the fuss is about.That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there. Dare we hope there could be a fourth series Meanwhile, Cox is clearly having a ball with raging bull Logan and yes, Succession still has the classiest score in town.Cue the piano ...Sky Atlantic, pm tonight"},{"url":null,"title":"give-loved-ones-gift-relaxation-stobo-christmas","story":"From the sweeping driveway when one enters the castle, guests are enveloped into anenvironmentof unrivalled luxury, serenity and calmness.

The problem, though, lies with lack of resource, not recalcitrant staff practices, and I refer to lack of workforce, not wages.The most up-to-date source of comparison by country I could find was published by the OECD.The figures are for the UK as a whole, and we are the th worst of  countries for proportion of doctors to patients that may be expressed awkwardly but when I also point out we are the th highest of  countries for premature deaththe correlation becomes more understandable.I, of course, accept that correlation doesnrsquot prove causation, but it does pose a question. The problem of understaffing the NHS spans years and implicates all political parties.Certainly it makes sense to blame NHS failings on doctors, the human shield for politicians of all stripes. It would be tangential and too time-consuming to confront long-held and cherished misconceptions ndash but the NHS did not shut down, GPs did continue from the very start of the pandemic to see patients in person, and hospitals tried to continue non-Covid but urgent medical care.The myth of ldquoclosed doors is egregious except in the sense of preventing poor souls wandering the corridors in the interest of infection control.The proportion of in-person contact had to be adjusted to allow greater numbers to be assessed and for fellow professionals to staff Covid Assessment Centres and then direct care to those most in need during a crisis, one which is ongoing.Still, things could be worse. There are only seven countries of  with fewer hospital beds per head of population than the UK, according to the OECD.Primary care would seem to be punching above its weightanyone could believe the suggestion that a deficiency of doctors and hospital beds could impact health outcomes.Denis Clford, Kilsyth.WHEN LOCAL ISNrsquoT QUITE LOCAL#MY husband has just received his appointment for a Covid and flu vaccination.The centre he has to visit is  miles away, in Johnstone. Given that there is a centre one mile from us I donrsquot understand the logistics, as surely a computer programme would match post-codes to localities of centres.I phoned the helpline and after going through ious processes I got to speak to an adviser who didnrsquot seem to have a grasp of the geography of Glasgow and surrounding areas, as I was offered appointments in Bearsdenor Gfnock .Eventually she arranged an appointment at our local centre.This process must be causing problems for many people who perhaps donrsquot understand that they can rearrange the appointment and worry about getting to the centre.It is also costing the NHS money to staff the helpline, which would not be needed If the process was expedited correctly in the first placeChristine Cameron, Garrowhill, Glasgow.A BEDSIDE MANNER THAT I CAME TO DREADREADING about the demand for ato face-to-face consultations with GPrsquos, my thoughts go back to the s when I, as a small child, had to suffer the attentions of a large and heavy GP who always came bouncing into our home and descended onto my bed, iniably squashing my feet.I appear to have suffered from most of the childhood ailments circulating at the time but, to me, the greatest suffering of all came from home visits by my GP.He may have been a great clinician, because I am still around to tell the tale, but he had an appalling bedside manner.I would have welcomed remote consultations with open arms ndash our recent two-metre social distancing for a start, would have protected my feet ndash but of course the current technology wasnrsquot available, or even conceived of.David L. Smith, Newton Mearns.A TOTALITARIAN COVID VACCINE POLICYTHERE is nothing more certain than that the next gigantic U-turn in a very, very long series of U-turns by the SNP is the Covid vaccine policy.It will bite the dust with all the others primarily because it will certainly cost them votes, and they need these votes eventually to implement the only policy that really concerns them.In the meantime we have to go through this ldquopapers, pleasersquorsquo totalitarian rigmarole because of the arrogance of the SNP and the insistence that they are right and everyone  wrong and the empress is indeed wearing clothes.This effort could have been much better employed trying to persuade those still reluctant to vaccinate ndash eventhat meant ndash as Jackie Baillie suggests - door-to-door campaigns.It is no comfort to know that this policy will fall like so many others and the Special Adviser Army will be employed trying to spin that that is what they intended all along.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.THIS BBC REPORT JUST WASNrsquoT CRICKETITrsquoS astonishing that Mark Smith hasnrsquot noticed the anti-SNP and anti-Scotland bias of the BBC .He makes a fair point about the dference between opinion and news pieces in the press. Opinion pieces are biased because they are meant to be, readers understand that, and papers like The Herald contain thoughtful, often provocative opinion pieces which both support and attack Scottish independence and the SNP.But the reporting on BBC news by broadcast journalists such as Sarah Smith or Laura Kuenssberg is highly partisan and will always put a negative spin on Scotland, the Scottish Government and the SNP, whilst Kuenssberg herself is little more than the Tory party mouthpiece.Even innocuous and non-political news is biased in the BBC. Only the other night I watched Clive Myrie announce in astonished tones that Scotlandhad beaten Bangladesh at a cricket match.His reaction indicated an unconscious bias of belittling Scotland as the standard default position. Why could Mr Myrie not just report this as a fact  If it is an unusual occurrence, why could he not have provided some facts to support how unusualthis was  Why didnrsquot he mention the delight of Scottish cricket fans The BBC is supposedly the standard-bearer of Britishness, so why could he not have made more of the fact that this was news which all Britons should celebrate  But the effect of his querulous tone was to isolate and put down Scotland. The news item was then promptly dismissed without further coverage.Mairianna Clyde, Edinburgh.MARK Smith is right when he points out that opinion should not be confused with news, and asks for ldquoprogrammes, dates, times as evidence that programmes from Scotland are heavily weighted against nationalism.May I suggest, for starters, Question Time and Newsnight and as for dates and times, almost every time they are on air.Despite the SNP being the third largest party in the House of Commons, they seldom appear on these programmes ndash unlike in olden times, when the Liberal Democrats popped up regularly when they were the third largest party at Westminster.On September , , a couple of days before the independence referendum, this newspaperrsquos view was that ldquoThe Herald backs Scotland staying within the UK at this stage. But fudge this process, stitch it up and fail to deliver far-reaching further devolution, and make no mistake: you will be guaranteeing another referendum ndash one that you will lose, and deserve to lose.My question to The Herald is: do you believe that far-reaching further devolution has been delivered, andyou donrsquot, will you call for another referendum on Scotlandrsquos constitutional future  That would be your opinion, but it would also be news.Ruth Marr, Stirling.MARK Smith is not a columnist with whom I often agree, but he got it right with his remarks about alleged BBC lsquobiasrsquo.Governments of every description in this country have feuded with the Corporation over what they view as its bias. The Tories have made all sorts of unpleasant noises about cutting the BBC down to size, partly because they suspect what they see as its liberal tendencies. BBC news correspondents do a much more efficient job of reporting the failings at Holyrood and Westminster than do those newspapers that proudly display their own, inflated political bias.M.

after the fault was repaired but caused disruption to schooling and commuters.Loch Riddon which should have been replaced by  itself broke down with engine gearbox issues in July leaving CalMac scrambling to find a replacement ferry.It comes after a summer of breakdowns and disruption in the CalMac network.Meanwhile, would-be ferry replacements MV Glen Sannox and Hull  are still languishing

year after Ineos abandoned plans to build a state-of-the-art car plant in Wales, announcing that it would build its new x Grenadier cars at a former Mercedes-Benz factory in France instead.It had previously pledged to build the Grenadier in Bridgend, Wales, creating up to  jobs.In January, Mr Ratclfe snubbed politicians investigating transforming Grangemouth into a carbon neutral hub.The Scottish Government had set up the Grangemouth Future Industry Board which will ldquoensure the signicant opportunities for low carbon economic growth are maximised and attempt to ldquounlock potential investment and identy policy levels that can support sustainable growth.The Scottish Government said at the time that the board was at an ldquoearly stage of development and would have ldquodecarbonisation woven through all aspects of its work.Ministers also committed pound million to support the industrial and manufacturing sectorsrsquo transition to net zero.The strategy for Grangemouth and wider heavy industry points to carbon capture and storage being scaled up ndash with ministers considering using ldquoScotlandrsquos vast storage potential to import ldquoCO via ship from European carbon capture projects, which officials hope could lead to ldquoopening up the potential for a CO transportation economy.Despite calls from campaigners to speed up decarbonisation,

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months. Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

He has also secured legislative success with the passing of two Private Members Bills: one to remove convicted terrorists as Special Advisers and more recently his Functioning of Government Act which reduced the number of SpAds, limited their salaries and made it a criminal offence for a minister or Spad to misuse official information.”The Assembly election is expected to be held in May  however could be soonerStormont collapses or is brought down early.

The application is now awaiting a decision from Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up According to figures from the Department for Infrastructure , a total of , representations have been made regarding the applications —  in support and , in opposition.Colin Buick, chair of the campaign group No-Arc, said: “It is estimated that the total revenue generated for Becon Indaver from the Hightown development could be in excess of £.bn in gate fees charged to councils. This is an eye-watering amount of money which will fall on local ratepayers to fund.”Alliance MLA John Blair said, in addition to the environmental impacts and associated residential amenity implications on the plans, he has serious concerns around the cost of the incineration contracts.“We have seen reports from England of councils who have been locked into expensive contracts and face legal challenges when they try to leave those contracts,” he said.The Arc councils could be tied into contracts for up to  years.”Mr Blair added the gate fees create a “contradictory incentive” for the local councils and or the incinerator operator, which, on the one hand, will have a duty to recycle, but, on the other, must fulfil a contract that they have entered into and have committed to for many years.Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said there has been a failure by Stormont to deliver a waste strategy or a clean air strategy for Northern Ireland.“The proposed incinerator would therefore exist outside of the strategic policy framework Northern Ireland needs to reduce our waste creation and protect our environment. The Green Party cannot support an incinerator without the strategies that will guarantee that people’s health and wellbeing are put first,” she said.DfI said Minister Nichola Mallon is keen to bring a resolution to the long-standing application for all involved.“Departmental officials continue to work at pace and in line with planning policy on this application and when all statutory processes are complete, a recommendation will be brought forward to the Minister for her consideration,” DfI added.In a statement, Arc said Northern Ireland is currently relying on sending rubbish to landfills, or shipping it overseas, which is environmentally and financially unsustainable.“Instead of paying to export waste for others to generate energy and jobs from, we should take responsibility for own waste. The technology proposed by Arc, which has a track record of success across Europe, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by , tonnes per year compared to landfill, generate MW of energy, improve recycling rates by up to % and generate £m Gross Value Add annually for the local economy,” the organisation said..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsJohn BlairClare BaileyDepartment for InfrastructureMore On John Blair PremiumRevealed: Over three million tonnes of NI waste exported in five years PremiumLength of PSNI investigations into its own officers ‘hitting public confidence’, warns Policing Board member Premium PSNI officers quizzed over sexual misconduct claims in last five yearsPetition launched against DAERA’s proposed badger cull PremiumJohn Blair: ‘I want more LGBTQ people to be in politics’Most ReadJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatFamily left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleTop VideosPlayVideo: Man arrested as murder investigation is launched in Magherafelt \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandFormer Belfast employee calls on the BBC to ban its use of ‘gagging orders’Northern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterVictim found in field with kne wounds ‘was attempted murder’Warm October is ‘a wake-up call’ over global climate crisisAlleged former top spy inside IRA involved in ‘outrageous’ attempt to delay legal action against him, it’s claimedLatestFormer Belfast employee calls on the BBC to ban its use of ‘gagging orders’Man arrested after , euros cannabis seizure in KildareNorthern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterSir Paul McCartney and Taylor Swt to induct new members into rock hallVictim found in field with kne wounds ‘was attempted murder’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This means she cannot reveal the details of her allegations.Ms Carlin, who left the BBC in , reached a £, settlement with the BBC in February this year after she had sued the corporation in  over grievances dating back years.She signed her NDA after appealing to the BBC’s director-general, Tim Davie, to draw a line under her ordeal, which she said impacted her financially and almost destroyed her mental health.Back in , the then-director general Tony Hall pledged to ban the BBC’s use of NDAs, following the Jimmy Savile scandal.“Since I left the BBC in  and throughout my legal case, I have watched the BBC regularly report on the abuse of NDAs, hold other organisations to account through Freedom of Information requests and highlight the work of Maria Miller MP calling for a ban on NDAs for the exact same reasons I have been silenced over,” Ms Carlin said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It was hard to stomach when I was out of work, hanging on to my home by a thread, ill and broke in the middle of a pandemic and not being able to speak about it. I sought protection under the BBC’s whistleblowing policy twice. It was not forthcoming.“The situation ended in a diagnosed injury to my mental health, the loss of my job, the signing of an NDA and a brutal and prolonged litigation process. It was all entirely avoidable.“I am calling on the BBC to ban the use of non-disclosure agreements as the former BBC Director General Tony Hall once promised.“I am asking to be released from a gagging clause that puts the BBC’s corporate reputation before my freedom to speak and ability to recover.”A BBC NI spokesperson said: “Since  there have been no contractual restrictions on former employees making comment on their experience of working at the BBC.“Furthermore, nothing has ever prevented anyone from whistleblowing, which has a clear status in law.”Over the past three-and-a-half years, the BBC has paid out £.m to settle workplace disputes before they can reach employment tribunals. Last year, it emerged that Lena Ferguson, the former head of BBC NI’s politics department, was suing the corporation over bullying allegations.Ms Carlin said: “The reason why I am speaking out about NDAs is because I had no idea the dficulty it would create for me in trying to rebuild my career.“After signing an NDA many iniduals including myself find it very dficult to work in the same sector again. I found myself going for interviews and being repeatedly asked for the reason why I had left the BBC. These were in competency-based interviews so I knew the question was not being asked of other candidates.“The NDA forced me into a position where I could not tell the truth. I could not explain the circumstances so I had to come up with a cover story.“As a rule I don’t lie. I have told the truth the whole way through this -year ordeal.“I’m also speaking out against the BBC’s use of NDAs because public money is being used to buy silence and that enables bullying and harassment to persist and thrive. “I have written to thank Mr Davie and asked him to put new policies and procedures in place that work in the best interests of all BBC employees.“I believe deeply in the BBC. It can be a brilliant place to work but brutal too, especiallyyou end up, like I did, on the wrong side of it.“I learned that at great personal cost.”Ms Carlin has since set up her own communications firm Carlin Creative..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatFamily left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleTop VideosPlayVideo: Man arrested as murder investigation is launched in Magherafelt \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandArmy veteran Dennis Hutchings dies with Covid- after Troubles trial adjournedNorthern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterVictim found in field with kne wounds ‘was attempted murder’Warm October is ‘a wake-up call’ over global climate crisisAlleged former top spy inside IRA involved in ‘outrageous’ attempt to delay legal action against him, it’s claimedLatestArmy veteran Dennis Hutchings dies with Covid- after Troubles trial adjournedEddie Jones: Exiled stars must show they have ‘will to prepare to win World Cup’Man arrested after , euros cannabis seizure in KildareNorthern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterSir Paul McCartney and Taylor Swt to induct new members into rock hall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For example, someone could own property in Northern Ireland via a chain of other companies based in ious countries. These countries are frequently tax havens, such as the British Virgin Islands and Switzerland.The leak revealed scores of these schemes, including how the Qatari ruling family avoided paying £.m in tax on a mansion in London and the leading family of Azerbaijan#s secret involvement in UK property deals worth more than £m.It has now emerged that the NI Land Registry has been working with the Department for Business, Energy  Industrial Strategy in GB to introduce measures that will provide more transparency when foreign entities  register property here.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said the Pandora Papers have publicly exposed what everybody has known for years - the wealthy will go to anyto hide their assets in order to avoid paying their fair share.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The rules apply to everybody  except those with deep pockets, he said.Successive Stormont Executives have sent a message continually that major corporations should have their taxes reduced in the fancul belief that wealth would trickle down, which it never does.Ministers in the Executive need to ensure that a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and fraud, and globally there is somewhere between . trillion to  trillion stashed in accounts, third-party companies and other complex arrangements.So, I hope the focus now shts away from ‘benefit fraud’ and attention turns to the real fraudsters in society - which is those who have millions and billions in their banks accounts but refuse to be subject to the same rules as the rest of us.SDLP MLA Justin McNulty added: “It’s welcome that the Land Registry are working to introduce new measures to ensure there will be more transparency around this issue, but we also need to see the British Government deliver on its long-promised legislation to name those who buy property through foreign companies.Finance Minister Conor Murphy should ensure that a register of foreign companies who own land in the North is maintained via the information held by Land and Property Services.“The Pandora Papers have shown the need for greater transparency around these issues at all levels of our society. The wealthy should not feel they can use the North as their play-thing to hide wealth, avoid tax, and engage in money laundering – we need to see immediate action to address these concerns.”On the Pandora Papers leak, Fergus Shiel, of the ICIJ, said:  There#s never been anything on this scale and it shows the reality of what offshore companies can offer to help people hide cash or avoid tax.They are using those offshore accounts, those offshore trusts, to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of property in other countries, and to enrich their own families, at the expense of their citizens..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsGerry CarrollDepartment of Finance Conor MurphyMore On Gerry Carroll PremiumClose to , NI Civil Service agency staff still waiting for pay rise announced last year PremiumCall to strip Capita of benefit payments role after firm fined £.m for failings PremiumFrustration as  requests for NDNA language discussion at Executive denied PremiumNo plans to introduce ‘right to disconnect’ legislation in Northern IreIand, says Economy Minister Gordon Lyons PremiumPIP firm Capita paid £m more than previously admittedMost ReadJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeNI petrol station halts unleaded sales after ‘contamination’ reportsCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatFamily left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleTop VideosPlayVideo: Man arrested as murder investigation is launched in Magherafelt \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news e .ece AUTOCROP wh bdffbdfaabfd.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Murder investigation launched after woman dies in Knockcloughrim car firePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest Northern IrelandArmy veteran Dennis Hutchings dies with Covid- after Troubles trial adjournedFormer Belfast employee calls on the BBC to ban its use of ‘gagging orders’Northern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterVictim found in field with kne wounds ‘was attempted murder’Warm October is ‘a wake-up call’ over global climate crisisLatestFormer Belfast employee calls on the BBC to ban its use of ‘gagging orders’Eddie Jones: Exiled stars must show they have ‘will to prepare to win World Cup’Man arrested after , euros cannabis seizure in KildareNorthern Ireland man’s , mile walk barefoot for sick daughterSir Paul McCartney and Taylor Swt to induct new members into rock hall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, congratulated the staff at the park for the retention of the status. “Brooke Park is a real gem in the heart of the city and it has been maintained resplendently over the last five years for everyone to enjoy,” he said. “During the lockdown restrictions it was a place where people could visit to relax and enjoy the outdoors and children enjoyed the state of the art play facilities in a safe environment.     “Congratulations to council’s parks team for all their hard work in ensuring the park met the criteria for the Green Flag which I’m sure will highlight the park’s offering to new visitors this year.” Rachel Vaughan, who manages the Green Flag Awards programme, said she hoped people would use the awards as an incentive to visit some new places in one of the most beautul seasons of the year. “We all love a walk through the autumn leaves and it’s uplting to discover a new spot to enjoy,” she said. “When you visit a Green Flag park or open space you can be reassured that the location is being managed to a really high standard as they’ve been through a rigorous judging process that assesses sites across a range of issues including their horticultural standards, cleanliness, bioersity and safety. “At a time when many people’s finances are under pressure, it’s important to highlight the fact that all Green Flag spaces are free to everyone.” Parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of local communities and come in many shapes and sizes. The expert judges, who are all volunteers themselves, were delighted to include several community spaces in this year’s selection, which are also run and managed by volunteers at a local level. These include: Shellinghill Park and Millennium Path, Sentry Hill Community Garden, Footprints Women’s Centre, Rathfern Activity Centre, Toome Linear Walk and Ballyeaston Church Ruin.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few.

Local climate and environmental campaigners recently formed a Derry North West COP Climate Action organising hub geared towards organising actions on the thNovember and during the two week UN conference. googletag.cmd.push Representatives from the Derry North West COP Climate Action said: ‘So far governments have done too little, too late, colluding with corporations and continuing the exploitation of workers and the planet. We urge everyone who understands the threat posed by climate change to join protests because it is only through the mass mobilisation that we can build the kind of pressure needed for urgent, radical and systemic action to address the climate crisis.’ At September’s full meeting, Derry and Strabane Council backed People Before Profit Councillor Maeve O’Neills motion calling for support for the th of November Global Day of Actionin Derry and across these islands.     Cllr ONeill said, ‘The decisions made at COP will shape how governments respond, or not, to the climate crisis. Westminster, the Stormont Executive and the Daacuteil governments have failed to take the urgent and radical action needed. People power is the key to forcing decision makers away fromGovernment’sdo-nothing systemicapproach,focusing only on inidual actions.

The Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicerecently reported that July this year broke the record as its busiest month, with team being called out  times - three of which were in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area - and clocking up  flying hours in total. googletag.cmd.push The service, which aims to save lives, brains and limbs, has been tasked to the Derry City and Strabane District Council area  times from its inception in July  to August this year. The charity held its second abseil at the Tower Museum on the September  which saw  local people conquering the  foot drop on one of the city’s most iconic buildings. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Graham Warke, attended the event to show his support for Air Ambulance NI. Participating in the abseil were two members from the local Chamber of Commerce Paul Clancy, chief executive, and Aidan O’Kane, Allstate NI director.     Abseiling alongside them were Karen McQuillan, finance director at Find Insurance, the main sponsors of this year’s Chamber dinner which Chamber president Dawn McLaughlin has chosen will benefit Air Ambulance NI.  Dawn McLaughlin, president of Derry Chamber of Commerce, with participants who took part in the abseil of the Tower Museum in aid of the Air Ambulance.  Also partaking in the adrenaline fuelling challenge was Caroline Doyle who is a member of the AANI agribusiness group and agricultural business manager for Barclays who are match-funding Caroline’s donations. City of Derry Young Farmers Club celebrated their th anniversary this year and decided to mark the milestone by raising funds for Air Ambulance NI in memory of member Gordon Crocketts father, David, who sadly lost his le last year in a farming accident. The young farmers sourced a -year-old Fendt tractor and used it duringa -hour plough at a family fun day in Eglinton in September last, the event raising over pound, for the charity. Also, Foyle Food Group brought the agribusiness together at a barbecue. Karen Kelso, group commercial director said: “It was lovely to be able to host this event both in recognition of the company milestone and to raise vital funds for the air ambulance given the downturn in fundraising through the pandemic. We were bowled over by the support of our farmers to the charity – we had  attendees on the evening and hundreds more bought tickets knowing they couldn’t attend simply to support this incredible lesaving service. “We would like to extend thanks to our almost  sponsors, all who supported the night and those who attended. Music from Richie Remo and Hugo Duncan was enjoyed by all. Foyle Food Group have raised a staggering pound, for the Air Ambulance NI charity.” However, the community support hasn’t stopped there. As well as these two events, shoppers at local Marks  Spencer’s in Foyleside Shopping Centre have been donating through in-store collection boxes during the health pandemic. Kerry Anderson, head of fundraising, said, “We want to send this special message of thanks to our supporters across Derry to let them know how much their support means to us. Quite literally the service would be grounded without you. This has been the busiest summer to date for the service which costs pound, every single day to maintain. “Although this service forms a vital part of the frontline emergency services in Northern Ireland, our lesaving missions need kind and generous support just like the community efforts we have witnessed recently throughout the city. The Air Ambulance NI volunteers and supporters are like no other, and we are immensely proud to have them as part of the service.”  Derry Chamber of Commerce members abseil from Tower Museum peak for ambulance charity     Top cop highly frustrated with response by public to Lyra McKee murder appeal  Huge frustration at the lack of eye-witnesses who have come forward    Derry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale  Local court told case complicated and unusual   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

As part of a wider campaign of thanksgiving, the Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, has called on everyone to show their appreciation through a gesture of thanks directed at someone who played a role in helping others over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push From today until Sunday next, October , buildings in the council area will be illuminated in purple to shine a light on the outstanding efforts made by those not just on the frontline in the NHS, but in our shops, our pharmacies, our care homes, our schools, and in the wider community. Mayor Warke is also asking local people to personally recognise those who made a dference to them by saying thank you, or making a small gesture with a gt or a card. He said: These have been unprecedented times of great hardship and fear for many people and we have come through this thanks to the wide network of dedicated workers and volunteers who have sustained our communities when we most needed help. I would like to ask people to think about someone who made a dference to their lives during lockdown, whether through their day-to-day work or volunteering in the community.     “It could be someone who delivered food parcels, who worked in a shop throughout the pandemic despite the risk, who reached out to an elderly neighbour, or checked in on a loved one. Everyone has been through an incredibly dficult experience, and I think we have all been touched by acts of kindness that have lted our spirits in the darkest of times. “Now, as we gradually emerge from lockdown, its a great time to say thank you for the small things that have sustained us, and the people who made a dference when we most needed it. The Week of Thanksgiving stems from a council motion passed in February this year calling for recognition of the local effort in response to Covid-. The motion called on the local authority to formally acknowledge the good work of the community and voluntary sector by considering all opportunities to recognise workers and volunteers in the sector. pound, was set aside for a number of recognition initiatives taking place throughout the year.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Week of Thanksgiving stems from a council motion passed in February this year calling for recognition of the local effort in response to Covid-. The motion called on the local authority to formally acknowledge the good work of the community and voluntary sector by considering all opportunities to recognise workers and volunteers in the sector. pound, was set aside for a number of recognition initiatives taking place throughout the year.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The Sky Blues slumped to a second consecutive defeat at the hands of Newry City – despite having taken the lead. Benny McLaughlin gave Stute an early lead at the Brandywell but an equaliser from Stephen Lawless and James Teelans strike on the hour gave Newry the points. googletag.cmd.push While Donaghey could not fault his troops for work-rate, a lack of quality has caused enough concern for him to seek new blood to bolster his squad. He said: “Without revealing too much, Ive ten players in mind who Id like to bring to the team. “It would be great to get all of them but it could very well work out that I go for ten and end up being able to bring in three on that list. “We will have to see. By Christmas, that list could potentially rise to twenty but, I will be trying to get new faces in to add to our numbers.     “Ive not yet entered into any talks with most of them as they are still under contract at their own clubs. Those who are at amateur level I have had a chat with. Again we will have to wait and see. “With the squad that I have right now, the work-rate is there but we are just missing that bit of quality that can convert that work-rate into points and get us higher up the league. “We not only need to create more chances but we have to take them too. A good side like Newry showed that last week. “Im also looking to see where the leaders in our squad are and for them to step up. It doesnt help when you have injuries to key players but you still have to show some leadership out there. “Newry are the best team weve played so far but some of our players need to grow up very quickly. “I knew what I was getting into when I arrived here but it seems we do need to strengthen the squad which is what Ill be trying to do.” Institute currently lie third from bottom in the NIFL Championship and face a tricky-trip to promotion-chasing Ballyclare Comrades on Saturday. Comrades flexed their muscles ahead of Institutes visit with a - win at fourth in the table, Annagh United. Donaghey added: “Ballyclare are a very progressive club with lots of experience in their squad. “However,we can step up and add the quality needed to go with our work-rate, we can hopefully get something.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

McCarter watched his side put in a sterling performance down at Cork as they headed back up north with a - win at Sundays Well. googletag.cmd.push Alex McDonnell led the way with a try, a penalty and two conversions with Paddy Blennerhasset also crossing over. It has been a slow start to the season for City of Derry but as McCarter says, this victory was hard-earned and well-deserved. He said: “It was a good one to get – a great performance and, thank God, a good one to get over the line. “Its a bit of a monkey of our back now. To be honest, whenever youre not winning its dficult at times. “We havent had much luck in terms of injuries and players not being available.     “Even on the morning of the game, one of the players – David Lapsley – woke up feeling very unwell. “He didnt even make it out of the hotel and with everything  thats gone before, youre starting to think that the rugby Gods just dont want us to win another game. “David just woke and felt unwell. His balance wasnt great so we just kept him in the hotel room. We were down a man before we had already started. “We got him back on the bus after the game and hopefully he will be better over the next few days. “As for the game itself, we knew it was important to get a good start – which we did. But within two minutes we were back at seven-all. “That was frustrating because we had started well for the first time in a while. We were definitely the better team up to that point and it was frustrating to give away a cheap score. “We picked ourselves back up again and got a penalty to take the lead going into half-time. We had been playing into a breeze the opening forty minutes so we had negotiated the conditions pretty well. “We had a big forty minutes to put in for the second half and showed good discipline in forcing Sundays Well to give away a lot of penalties. “We put the pressure on them and forced them into a lot of knock-ons. Adam Marley was very effective as he forced three or four turnovers. We never allowed them to gain any momentum. “Then Alex scored a special inidual try – it came at an important time as well. Alex has the ability to create something out of nothing and he did that with a nice chip over the top which he finished well. “Sundays Well came back into it but I felt we could hold on. Looking back, the last five minutes were more comfortable than they were at the time.” The win takes City of Derry to fth spot in the All-Ireland Division c. However, having got the winning feeling, they now have to wait nearly two weeks before their next game at home to Bangor on October . McCarter added: “I suppose you could say its frustrating not to be playing the week after having got a win but we look at it as having an extra week to get those players who are injured more time to recover. Especially when weve a tough match in Bangor coming up next.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on .

Ms McLaughlin vacates her role as Economy Spokesperson to take up the position as as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office as well as being the SDLPs spokesperson on Covid Recovery. googletag.cmd.push The reshuffle also sees a move for East Derry MLA, Cara Hunter. She moves from the position of Mental Health Spokesperson to the role of Climate Champion. Cara will also sit on the Infrastructure Committee. Ms McLaughlins fellow Foyle MLA, Mark H Durkan, remains in his post as Communities  Culture Spokesperson. Foyle MP Mr Eastwood insisted that the shakeup of the party’s spokespeople is about holding Ministers to account and delivering better outcomes for people across the north of Ireland. He said: “The SDLP has the most energetic and effective front bench teams of any party in the Assembly. “The changes I have announced today will build on the work we have been doing over the last two years to change the lives of the people we represent.     “At a moment when others are retreating to the politics of boycott, ision and deadlock, the SDLP team is committed to breaking down barriers and delivering on the priorities of people in all of our communities. “That means managing the Covid- recovery, addressing the climate crisis and driving forward a prosperity agenda. “As part of these changes I have created new roles that reflect urgent political priorities.  “Sinead McLaughlin MLA will take on an ambitious new portfolio focussed on Covid recovery. Given the cross-cutting nature of this brief I have appointed Sinead as Chair of the Executive Office Committee where she will hold the First Ministers to account for the abject failure to produce a robust strategy to transform our society. “I have also appointed Cara Hunter MLA as the SDLP Climate Champion, reflecting the urgent need to address the crisis of global temperature increases and the impact it will have on a whole generation of people. “The consequences of inaction are severe and the SDLP is bringing tough legislative proposals at Stormont and Westminster that will address the crisis. Cara will also take on a new portfolio focussed on the ambitions and needs of a new generation of young people. “The SDLP team is full of ambitious and talented public representatives who have the energy and the ideas to transform our society. Applying their skills and experience to their new roles, I know that they’ll deliver for the people we represent.” Reacting to her new role on Twitter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “My new role starts this week as chair of the Assemblys Committee for the Executive Office, where I will be holding the joint first ministers to account, leading the SDLPs work on Covid recovery and demanding that Derry is treated with the justice and equality my city deserves.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct   addthis, Eoin Toal insists that he and his team mates will give everything between now and the end of the season as Derry City close in on third place and European football. The City captain played a massive role in the - win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell on Friday night, a victory which takes the Candystripes to within one point of third-placed Sligo Rovers. googletag.cmd.push Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe scored the only goal of the game to give City a signicant victory at an important stage of the season. “St. Pat’s are a great side and they are not second in the table for no reason,” Toal said afterwards. “We knew it was going to be a tough game. In the first half we weren’t our best and they probably had a few chances in the first half to go one or two up the main thing for us was to just dig in until half time and come in with a level head. “We knew we would get a few chances and we knew we would have to take them. Jack Malone came on and was brilliant, he gave the ball to Jamie who put in a brilliant cross for Junior to finish and that’s what he’s good at. We dug in really well after that and that’s a sign of a really structured team. We held out at the end there which was really good.”     City have come a long way in a short time under Ruaidhri Higgins, with European football now a real possibility. The team spirit is better than ever for a team that began the season with four successive defeats. “Ruaidhri has been brilliant since he came in,” Toal reiterated. “There’s a really good team spirit at the moment. We know how good a manager is and he definitely wants to bring good football to the Brandywell. “ It will be interesting but we have a big task ourselves and, hopefully, we can push on and try and get into that third spot. That’s our aim, and it’s going to be hard but we’re going to have to dig in and, hopefully, try to get it. “Everyone has to play each other so it’s going to be really tough but hopefully we can take each game as it comes and get the points we need.” Unavoidable The question of Europe is now unavoidable for Higgins, whose team have suffered just one defeat in the last nine league games. With home games against Bohemians and Sligo Rovers still to come, there is no doubt that Derry’s destiny is in their own hands. “Theres no point in playing the question down now with six games to go, he admitted. This was signicant. I think and it puts us right in the hunt for that place. The players deserve huge credit for getting themselves in this position. Its set up for us and well give it a real crack and see where it takes us. If we dont get into Europe it wont be for the want of trying because the players are giving absolutely everything. The staff are giving everything and have been brilliant to work with and theres a real good feel factor around the place at the minute and long may that continue. Friday also saw the biggest attendance at the Brandywell this season, with close to , fans cheering the team on to victory. Those rising numbers could well prove pivotal to City in the remaining games. “The crowd were absolutely brilliant tonight especially when Pats were dominating and had large periods in the game,” Higgins agreed. “They got right behind us and the dference when theres supporters in is mind blowing compared to when theyre not here. “Our supporters I think can identy with this team and appreciate what the players are giving and the players appreciate what the supporters are giving as well so hopefully it remains that way for a long, long time.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Gary Ferry Oct   addthis, Eoin Toal insists that he and his team mates will give everything between now and the end of the season as Derry City close in on third place and European football. The City captain played a massive role in the - win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell on Friday night, a victory which takes the Candystripes to within one point of third-placed Sligo Rovers. googletag.cmd.push Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe scored the only goal of the game to give City a signicant victory at an important stage of the season. “St. Pat’s are a great side and they are not second in the table for no reason,” Toal said afterwards. “We knew it was going to be a tough game. In the first half we weren’t our best and they probably had a few chances in the first half to go one or two up the main thing for us was to just dig in until half time and come in with a level head. “We knew we would get a few chances and we knew we would have to take them. Jack Malone came on and was brilliant, he gave the ball to Jamie who put in a brilliant cross for Junior to finish and that’s what he’s good at. We dug in really well after that and that’s a sign of a really structured team. We held out at the end there which was really good.”     City have come a long way in a short time under Ruaidhri Higgins, with European football now a real possibility. The team spirit is better than ever for a team that began the season with four successive defeats. “Ruaidhri has been brilliant since he came in,” Toal reiterated. “There’s a really good team spirit at the moment. We know how good a manager is and he definitely wants to bring good football to the Brandywell. “ It will be interesting but we have a big task ourselves and, hopefully, we can push on and try and get into that third spot. That’s our aim, and it’s going to be hard but we’re going to have to dig in and, hopefully, try to get it. “Everyone has to play each other so it’s going to be really tough but hopefully we can take each game as it comes and get the points we need.” Unavoidable The question of Europe is now unavoidable for Higgins, whose team have suffered just one defeat in the last nine league games. With home games against Bohemians and Sligo Rovers still to come, there is no doubt that Derry’s destiny is in their own hands. “Theres no point in playing the question down now with six games to go, he admitted. This was signicant. I think and it puts us right in the hunt for that place. The players deserve huge credit for getting themselves in this position. Its set up for us and well give it a real crack and see where it takes us. If we dont get into Europe it wont be for the want of trying because the players are giving absolutely everything. The staff are giving everything and have been brilliant to work with and theres a real good feel factor around the place at the minute and long may that continue. Friday also saw the biggest attendance at the Brandywell this season, with close to , fans cheering the team on to victory. Those rising numbers could well prove pivotal to City in the remaining games. “The crowd were absolutely brilliant tonight especially when Pats were dominating and had large periods in the game,” Higgins agreed. “They got right behind us and the dference when theres supporters in is mind blowing compared to when theyre not here. “Our supporters I think can identy with this team and appreciate what the players are giving and the players appreciate what the supporters are giving as well so hopefully it remains that way for a long, long time.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Eglinton runner Smyth won his sixth Paralympic gold medal in a thrilling final of the T m race at this years Paralympic Games, which took place in Tokyo at the end of August. googletag.cmd.push It extended the world record holders medal tally at major eventsto . Mayor Warke invited Jason and his family to the Guildhall for a special civic reception to mark the continued success of the man nicknamed the GoldSmyth. Speaking after the event, Mayor Warke said: It was an honour to have Jason in the Mayors Parlour and to be able to congratulate him personally on the remarkable success that he has had. To win a sixth Paralympic gold medal and to remain unbeaten in ​years of Paralympics is something most sports people couldnt even dream of. It takes a serious amount of commitment, hard work and sacrice behind the scenes to reach that level of greatness and to perform on the biggest stage, and Jason has managed to do that year in, year out. He has represented our city and district on the world stage, and I felt it was only right that I show our appreciation on behalf of all the people of this Council area.     I want to wish Jason and his family all the very best and, hopefully, we are celebrating even more medals in the future. Jason is an inspiration to so many of us locally and to so many globally as well. His story is one that already has its rightful place in the history books and Im sure there are a few more chapters still to be written. Jason said overcoming injuries, dealing with the Covid- delay to the Games, and winning the final by just . seconds made his latest Paralympic gold one of the sweetest yet. I think, on reflection, because the race was so close and the lead up was so dficult, when I think back on all of the Games, its definitely been the most satisfying win. When Ive needed to get things right, Ive been able to do it - by the finest of margins - but when it counted. When I sit back and look at it, I can say that really went as well as it could have, so its very satisfying, but now Im thinking whats next and Im ready to move forward. He added it was great to be able to attend a Mayors reception and spend time with family members who had supported his journey. Sometimes, were away in the likes of Tokyo and were in our bubble and unaware of whats going on at home or whos watching, but when we do come home its great to see the recognition, the support, and the awareness. Its great to come into the Guildhall with the Mayor and have a reception with family because they are often the people who make the most sacrices.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them. The -year-old father of eight, whos Irelands last traditional matchmaker, said hell be using his well-honed techniques to conjure romance on Spanish soil, including bringing his -year-old “love ledger” with him to arrange dates.     The third-generation matchmaker said inquiries had already been flooding in from across the world following the release earlier this year of the Hallmark movie As Luck Would Have It, a romantic movie loosely based on the centuries-old matchmaking festival.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The incident occurred at Sandy Braes, Magherafelt.Local NewsMurder investigation launched after mans body found in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side. After  minutes they were awarded a penalty when Jack Sharvin was fouled in a clumsy challenge from Courtney inside the box.However, Sharvinrsquos spot kick was brilliantly saved by Andy Wallace.Four minutes later and Wallace produced heroics again, this time a save with his feet from Sam Carson after McComiskeyrsquos pace had again exposed Villa.The goal was coming, though, and it was goal of brilliance. Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

This is normally when I reach for the headphones, plug them into the laptop and search on the web for Bach or Beethoven to block out the external noise.Preacher Man belts out his hymns before handing out religious tracts to workers, shoppers, school kids and tourists who pass him by. He often starts his pitch just after a young red-haired Croatian woman finishes off her busking routine in the same street. The switch in styles and sound is eerily seamless.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIt appears almost asthe two of them have some kind of unwritten agreement as to when one of them wrap ups their set and the other takes to the street-stage.Although his repertoire is out of tune Preacher Man still has a powerful voice for someone in his late sixties or early seventies, which somehow feels connected to the strength of his religious conviction. It booms and resonates above the constant whoosh of buses and Gliders passing by in Wellington Place.While I am an atheist and secularist who believes in the separation of all churches from the state, I cannot help but admire the dedication of this lone grey haired, slightly built, eternally smiling evangelical singer pressing his leaflets non-intrusively towards a generally indferent Belfast public.There are other preachers also with a daily presence milling around the centre of the city who are,you like, more dficult “hard cases” for us non-believers. They either drive around in a car with a PA sound system mounted on its roof barking out conservative evangelical Christian messages in the same way politicians sell themselves on four wheels at election time or  they stand up in places like Cornmarket.They are also followed around the city centre by an equally determined knot of youthful LGBT activists who wave rainbow flags while staring face-off at those who preach among other things the so-called “sin” of homosexuality. Often the police are not far from the scene in case things get out of hand although in the numerous times I have witnessed these stand-offs both preachers and protestors have been entirely peaceful.Some on the left in this society believe that there should be no free speech for those labelled “hate preachers.” The Garda Siochana seem to share that view because at present three evangelical Christians are being tried in a Dundalk court for preaching against homosexuality in the Co Louth town back on September . The trio were arrested that day, handcuffed and charged with public order offences at Dundalk Garda station.Indeed, the PSNI set the bar for policing-the-preachers earlier this year by arresting other evangelicals in Larne, Enniskillen and Newry because they were accused of transmitting the same anti-gay messages.Yet the case of the Dundalk , the right of the hard-line preachers to offend those young activists that shadow them around Belfast city centre and the Gospel tract giving, solo singing preacher man outside my window all present liberals, socialists and secularists with the “Town Square Test”.This challenge was set in  by Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident, Jewish refusenik in the USSR and human rights activist.In his book ‘The Case For Democracy’, Sharansky said the threshold test for a free society was this: “If a person cannot walk into the middle of the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, imprisonment or physical harm, then that person is in a fear society, not a free society.”The radical flag waving band of LGBT demonstrators who stalk their evangelical opponents have every right to a space in that ‘town square’.Yet those they protest against also deserve their place in that public square too as do the Dundalk  no matter how ludicrous, objectionable or homophobic you think their street sermons may sound.So long as no one is publicly urging violence against those with lestyles they disapprove of then their right to free speech and free preach should be defended like everyone ’s. To start cherry picking who is allowed in the ‘town square’ is the slippery slope to a nascent form of totalitarianism.As I write on this typical Belfast autumnal day with an insipidly grey sky above and a seasonal chill in the air the street beyond my window it is unusually quiet. There are no medleys of s or s cult rock classics being rattled out on guitar by the Croatian busker or any Christian hymns being sung by the dogged evangelist who often encroaches on my concentration. I hope and guess that they both willsoon to Fountain Street and continue to occupy their rightful place also in Sharansky’s ‘public square.’• Owen Polley Oct : The EU didn’t even try to address the assault on NI’s place in UK• Ben Lowry Oct : Lord Frost’s speech on NI reflected notably more robust UK tactics• Peter Robinson Oct :  Any unionist praising the Good Friday Agreement is a heretic• Ruth Dudley Edwards Oct : SF is the driving force in the Irish demonisation of Israel• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Oct : Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’• Henry McDonald Oct : The biggest task for unionists is to get out their non voters• Henry McDonald Sep : For all the gushing attitudes to the EU in Dublin, Brussels can’t rely on Ireland to help it with an EU army• Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As a patron of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation he helped to raise awareness of the suffering caused to animals for human amusement. He spoke out against hare coursing decades before it was finally banned in Britain in . In  he sponsored a parliamentary motion that ripped apart the pathetic arguments in favour of the practice and made a passionate plea of behalf of the gentlest creature in the countryside.He consistently opposed foxhunting too even when many other Tory MPs supported it and rode to hounds themselves.Our own politicians could take a cue from this worthy parliamentarian by taking a stand for the animals and backing campaigns to end organized cruelty dressed up as “sport”.RIP Sir David Amess MP, a man who walked in the footsteps of St Francis.Thanking you,John Fitzgerald, Campaign for the Abolition of Cruel Sports, Co Kilkenny——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Everything that has been said about him in all these tributes is actually true. He was just well liked and he was very cheerful and encouraging.”I remember talkingto him after I came in and he was interested in the new MP from Northern Ireland. He was very encouraging and a very nice guy.”Lord Dodds said he had a big focus on animal welfare and in more recent years campaigned relentlessly for South End to be made a city“Every time he raised it there was a laugh because everyone was expecting it. He was never in high ministerial office and he never really sought that kind of political career. He was really a guy that made a lot of connections across all the parties at Westminster and was very well liked. He had been an MP for almost  years.”Lord Dodds also recounted the occasion when he was almost murdered as an MP.His six-year-old son Andrew was in the Intensive Care Unit of the Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Hospital at the time, in . He and his we Diane were collecting several items in the city centre when they got a call to come to the hospital urgently.Because it was urgent they rushed to the hospital without waiting for their usual police bodyguards. They were in the waiting room while medical staff worked with their son nearby.“And then we heard these almightybangs - shots ringing out in the corridor - and one of the nurses screaming and someone shouting for me to get down and block the door.“For what seemed an age it all stopped and then there was all this screaming and shouting. Eventually, as there was no way out of the room, we just opened the door. By this stage the gunmen had left.“The first thing we saw was a childs’ incubator with bullet holes in it. The police bodyguard who had arrived by that stage had been shot in the leg. It was bedlam.”The policeman had spotted two men coming down the corridor wearing wigs and had challenged them, so they had not been able to get any closer to the politician.“If they hadn’t been there they would have been able to walk straight down to us.”He added that the security threat faced by MPs in Northern Ireland during the Troubles was massively greater than that faced by MPs in England.“Rev Ian Paisley had bodyguards around the clock and at his house, as did Peter Robinson.“But for Assembly members and MPs this was almost something that you lived with.”Dissident republicans left a bomb outside the office on the Shore Road in . Others have received many threats and partial bombs.“Even after the Good Friday Agreement politicians in Northern Ireland have been very much targetedand have had to live with it. Typically they often had security at their offices and houses,bullet proof windows, panic alarms and even personal protection weapons.“Two MPs killed in five years in England is horrendous but for  years in NI MPs lived with this as a daily threat.”He noted that UUP MP Robert Bradford was killed in  killed during a surgery in Finaghy, along with his bodyguard. And that UUP assembly member Edgar Graham was shot dead in  outside Queen’s University.Fellow DUP member councillor David Calvert was shot and badly wounded in thelate s. And in the early s SDLP senator Paddy Wilson and his girlfriend were “brutally murdered” by loyalists, he added.But today, he believes that social media has “intensied and heightened” hatred towards MPs “especially women” and can also be used to gather intelligence on their movements.“They whip up an extraordinary amount of hatred and threats and I think these social media companies have got to stop this ability for people to go online anonymously and say whatever they like.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘Our angel’ message from heartbroken sister following workplace tragedyNorthern Ireland Conservative Party suffers four leadership resignations while local Ukip group disbands over NI ProtocolEU vows to protect Irelandnegotiations on protocol failSinn Fein leader should clary her view on the past murder of elected Northern Ireland politiciansJeff Dudgeon to European human rights commissioner: You attack the UK for this amnesty but not for past ones that benefitted terrorists — why not Most PopularMan who had thousands of indecent images of children escapes jail because of long court delaysPSNI arrest suspect, , after man in early twenties left in critical condition in hospitalRev Ivan Foster: Ecumenical church leaders have hijacked the centenary of the founding of Northern IrelandBen Lowry: Lord Frost’s speech on the Northern Ireland Protocol reflected a notably more robust UK approach to the borderPSNI launch murder investigation after body found in house, man arrested nearby                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could barely stand to leave the room.As social distancing was in place staff were unable to physically comfort Ms Paskell, whorsquod been unable to bring her partner to the scan.ldquoI understand why Phil couldnrsquot be there, but I donrsquot think itrsquos right for any woman to have to go through that on their own, said Ms Paskell.ldquoI was gone for longer than expected so he called me, and I had to tell him over the phone, while he was looking after our four children at home.The next dayshe went to University Hospital of Wales alone to deliver baby Cariad who was estimated to be  weeks old when she passed away ndash and was later revealed to have Downrsquos syndrome.ldquoI delivered her on my own, said Ms Paskell, who was also grieving her grandmother whorsquod died unexpectedly in April .ldquoThe staff were very supportive ndash they allowed time with Cariad to hold her and sing to her. They made some footprints for me and I had some photos taken.     ldquoI told her how sorry I was that I couldnrsquot protect her and that I had to leave. Instead of bringing a baby home all I had was a little box with her footprints and photos.ldquoI didnrsquot deal with the aftermath very well at all ndash trying to grieve without being around my family was extremely hard.Cariad had a private funeral ndash attended only by her parents ndash at James Summers funeral home.ldquoThe funeral home was amazing ndash particularly Julie, said Ms Paskell.ldquoShe helped with everything, including reading a poem at Cariadrsquos funeral.This month would have marked Cariadrsquos first birthday ndash instead her mother is raising money for two charities: Aching Arms and Downrsquos Syndrome Association.ldquoAching Arms supported me personally, said Ms Paskell.ldquoI received a teddy bear from them, which is something to hold when my arms feel empty. In October last year I found out Cariad had Downs Syndrome which is why Irsquove also chosen Downs Syndrome Association.ldquoIrsquove never taken part in a fundraiser before, but I felt I needed to do something and hopefully help other families.Throughout October she will cycle km using exercise bikes at Cogan Leisure Centre gym - her fundraising page is available here.ldquoI chose cycling as I recently joined the gym an enjoy using the exercise bikes, said Ms Paskel.ldquoAs theyrsquore electronic I can keep track of progress ndash km will certainly challenge me as I only joined the gym at the beginning of September. I have told one of the instructors there who is very supportive.\"OTHER NEWS:She continued: ldquoIn the UK it is estimated that one in four pregnancies ends in baby loss ndash but I donrsquot think itrsquos talked about enough.ldquoI donrsquot want anyone to feel they canrsquot say Cariadrsquos name to me or ask me about her.ldquoI am a mum to five amazing beautul children and always will be ndash Irsquom lucky enough to hold four in my arms every day and I hold Cariad in my heart. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeaving the main car park and tramping pavements along Heol Gorllewin to pass the Prince of Wales pub, which features in the tale of the Maid of Sker, the group then entered the southern part of the vast Kenfig Burrows. These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself.
