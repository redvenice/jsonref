It’s time we started listening to them.\u0027   The length of the menstrual cycle varies between inidual women, but the average is every 28 days. However, cycles as short as 21 days or as long as 40 are not considered unusual.   The NHS advises women to contact their GP if their periods are irregular in certain situations. These include: if their periods suddenly become irregular and they are under 45-years-of-age, their periods come more often than every 21 days and less often than every 35 days, their period lasts longer than seven days, and there is a difference of at least 20 days between the shortest and longest menstrual cycle. Irregular periods can also lead to problems when women are trying to get pregnant as it becomes difficult to accurately track ovulation, the time when they are most likely to conceive. The latest UK Government data indicates just over 48million people have received two doses of Covid vaccines. "},{"url":null,"title":"Civil service unions call names REDACTED Sue Grays Partygate report","story":"Share this articleCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servants"},{"url":null,"title":"The END mandatory masks England","story":"Share this articleThe Health Secretary insisted: ‘Our vaccines, testing and antivirals ensure we have some of the strongest defences in Europe and are allowing us to cautiously return to plan A, restoring more freedoms to this country. ‘As we learn to live with Covid, we need to be clear eyed that this virus is not going away so if you haven\u0027t already – please come forward for your first, second or booster jab.’ It comes as the Prime Minister awaits Miss Gray’s official report into multiple alleged parties in No10 and Whitehall during the pandemic.It is not clear what the report has discovered but an indication of how damaging it could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out, based in part on evidence obtained by the Gray investigation. There was speculation that after the report was not delivered yesterday, MPs and the public may have to wait until after the weekend for its publication, as Mr Johnson had promised to address the Commons shortly after it was released.There were suggestions that due to today being Holocaust Memorial Day and many MPs being back in their constituencies from Thursday afternoon, No10 may hold off on publishing the report once it was received.However, Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the conclusions would be important enough to bring to the House straight away.Earlier, during Prime Minister’s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign. Asked if he would quit, the Prime Minister said: ‘No.’Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson would not have to step aside even if he was interviewed by police in their probe.Speaking on Channel 4 News, Mr Rees-Mogg said ‘that wouldn\u0027t be a resigning matter, because people are innocent in this country until proved guilty’.But if the outcome of the Gray report is significantly damaging, Mr Johnson could face a revolt from his own MPs, who may choose to call a vote of no confidence.The Mail reported that Tories were urging the PM to scrap a planned hike in national insurance to win back their support.The Commons Treasury Committee has warned in a report released on Thursday that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would contribute to a rise in inflation.Conservative MP for Bolton North East Mark Logan said that while Mr Johnson had his support, there needed to be a reset.When the Gray report is published, sources close to the investigation team expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide.Downing Street said it is the ‘intention’ to publish the report in the format in which Mr Johnson receives it."},{"url":null,"title":"Carries friend Goldsmith says PM NOT involved efforts help airlift animal charity Kabul","story":"Share this article Peers today called for Goldsmith to appear before them and explain what happened over the controversial airlift.Labour former defence secretary Lord Browne of Ladyton said: \u0027Once again we\u0027re being treated to ministers in studios and in the House not facing up to the fact that the evidence is out there.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillReductions in fares – including the possibility of free tickets for children – are among measures being considered to encourage people back on to public transport now that Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted.The Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee heard on Thursday that the National Transport Authority’s (NTA) biggest challenge in the area is to understand what the new pattern of commuting will be as people return to their offices, in many cases with hybrid arrangements involving remote work.NTA chief executive Anne Graham said that public transport services were cut by up to 75 per cent at various stages of the pandemic and there was a 50 per cent reduction in usage in 2020.This situation continued in 2021 and while there was a recovery in passenger numbers at times, “it was still well below pre-pandemic levels.”Services continued during lockdowns for essential workers.Ms Graham said increased Government funding offset the fare revenue shortfall due to the pandemic and as a result public transport operators suffered no commercial loss.The only remaining Covid-19 measure for public transport is the ongoing requirement of passengers to wear face masks.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy asked senior NTA officials what they are doing to rebuild use of public transport.Ms Graham said that people being told not to use public transport during the pandemic “had a very significant impact on confidence” in terms of its safety.Additional cleaning and other controls were put in place but she said the NTA is planning marketing campaigns to build passenger confidence again.She gave the example of the NTA’s pre-pandemic “Kids Go Free” campaign in the summer of 2019 and suggested this could return to encourage use by young people and their parents.Travel patternDirector of public transport at the NTA, Tim Gaston, said: “The biggest challenge that we face is understanding what the new pattern is going to be. What will be the new normal?”He predicted that most “white-collar workers” won’t be back in the office five days per week and questioned if everybody will want to go to their workplaces on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. He said theses issues need “teasing out” and work is being done on this.He also said suburbs are busier than the city centre and bus services may need to be rebalanced in terms of services and frequency. He said this will be delivered through the Bus Connects process.Earlier Ms Murphy criticised the operation of BusConnects routes in west Dublin and north Kildare, claiming that some buses are empty, not turning up and not connecting to other services.Ms Graham said she was disappointed to hear this but it is difficult to measure the success of the service due to the Covid-19 pandemic and that empty buses could be due to reduced passenger numbers.Ms Murphy said she did not accept this. She said aspects of the service are working but some parts are “deplorable” and she warned that if the NTA don’t pick up on that the same mistakes will be made as BusConnects gets rolled out elsewhere.Ms Graham said she takes the feedback seriously in terms of future rollout. “But I still do believe that there is an issue around the fact that the patterns are not back to their normal level.”Separately, Hugh Creegan, the NTA’s deputy chief executive, rejected a suggestion by Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley that a combined €223 million that has already been spent on BusConnects, link and DART Plus planning is excessive.Mr Cregan said they are “enormous projects” and such spending was needed to ensure value for money during the delivery phase."},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord taoiseach s patience snaps as mary lou plays the elitism card","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has told Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald he had a “far different” upbringing to her during testy exchanges in the Dáil. Video: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: Playing the man not the ball? Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireDing-Dong! Mary Lou on high (horse).Maybe a bit late for a Christmas carol, but old scores were all the rage in the Dáil on Wednesday, where rage was also all the rage.But before we get to that, how about some good news?For in the midst of vicious exchanges on the housing crisis between the Taoiseach and the leader of Sinn Féin, there came confirmation from a gilded bunker in Baggot Street which gladdened hearts all across the land.Robert Watt, the Generous Salary, sorry, general secretary of the Department of Health, is now happily restored to optimum pay (nearly €295,000).This emerged in a one-line statement from his department: “The secretary general has confirmed that he is in receipt of the full salary for his role.”Having previously waived the €81,000 pay rise he was due upon moving from the Department of Public Expenditure to his current berth, the civil servant recently refused to tell the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee if this was still the case. Pointed remarks about transparency from two senior Government Ministers this week may have forced a change of heart.Because after a couple of gentle whacks from Darragh O’Brien and Heather Humphreys, The Generous Salary revealed he is now accepting his full whack.Word came through around midday, after a Labour Party motion on spiralling inflation and the soaring cost of living had given way to a rancorous clash on affordable rents.It lifted the spirits of our post-pandemic inflation nation.Shouting matchThe news sustained us through the bitter row over housing during Leaders’ Questions and helped us recover from an angry shouting match between Michael Healy-Rae and the Labour Party which took place just before.There is always an edge to the exchanges between Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, with the Taoiseach constantly annoyed by the Sinn Féin leader’s attempts to box him off as a supporter and enabler of billionaire property developers while he tries to explain what his Government is doing to tackle the crisis he repeatedly calls “the single most important issue facing our country at this moment in time”.Mary Lou has the justifiable anger and frustration of shut-out buyers and stressed-out renters on her side. She has an arsenal of harrowing anecdotes to draw upon. She has Eoin Ó Broin to throw his book at him. She has the entire dysfunctional mess of the property market for ammunition.Go fix it, she tells the Taoiseach. Fix it now. Do something. Do something now.He outlines the projects and schemes under way. He talks about the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State. Record “commencements”. Billions being spent. Construction bouncing back. “The momentum, as it were, is in the pipeline.”But it needs time and “a whole-of-government approach” and cross-party buy-in.Mary Lou McDonald gets to her feet.“So, you failed,” she tells him. “Let me help you, Taoiseach, to try and absorb the reality.” She holds up a photocopied page showing an advert for a flat to rent. Mad money. “So, this is a storage room . . .” she begins, before producing two more pages of equally dismal places for rent.Converted hallwayOne in Cork where “you could touch your fridge if you stretch your feet out of your bed” and a converted hallway in Dublin going for €910 a month.“That’s probably a snip, in your mind.”But she wasn’t finished with him yet.She had shown him the reality for Generation Rent. “Don’t you dare talk to me about false narratives or claim that you understand the crisis. You clearly don’t. While you’re there scratching your head I’ve told you two things you can do that will work . . .”If he does them, people might believe “that you finally get it”.Sinn Féin TDs cheered their leader as she resumed her seat.The Taoiseach rose, clearly annoyed by the personal nature of the attack. So he took the personal route too, stung by her parting shot that he doesn’t “get it”.“You paint a narrative in terms of me” – he pointed to himself – “as being orced from reality and all of that.”Across the floor the TDs couldn’t resist. “You are! You are!” they chorused.He put up a hand to silence them. “Okay. I just want to say to you, deputy, my background and where I grew up and what we had to put up with is far different to yours.”The Taoiseach was leaning forward, directly addressing his opposite number. He didn’t raise his voice but his anger was evident in those clipped, level tones.A few dissenting voices rose up. Again, his hand went up to quell them. He wanted to make his point, which he did, eyes still locked on his political rival.“Don’t you dare lecture me,” he said slowly. “Okay?”Bus driverThere was a sense of an old score being settled here by a man frustrated and totally fed up by the constant inferences that he is a heartless member of some detached, moneyed elite. Micheál Martin, the son of a bus driver from Cork city, who believes he incorporates the decent values of old Fianna Fáil, had had enough.“I understand the realities of life as well as anybody in this House. And I don’t pretend to understand it more,” he said as the heckling grew in intensity and the back-and-forth became more and more bitter, Eoin Ó Broin and Pearse Doherty joining Mary Lou in the fray.Still angry, the Taoiseach accused Sinn Féin of talking from both sides of its mouth and exploiting the crisis for political gain.“This crisis is too big for politics,” he said.Mary Lou McDonald shot over a pitiful eye, batting his words away with a dismissive hand as if speaking to a difficult child.“Stop that. Stop that. Stop that,” she repeated. “Stop now.”“Deputy, you are not the leader. You were not appointed by the Politburo,” snarled Micheál.“So just BACK OFF!”The Taoiseach’s unusual reaction was understandable – there is a definite element of playing the man and not the ball to Mary Lou’s approach, but when the Ceann Comhairle called time, one suspects Sinn Féin will have been far more satisfied with their afternoon’s work.Earlier in the day, it was Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae who took the chance to settle an old score. Last year, after lambasting the Labour Party for its lack of affinity with the plain people of Ireland, the Kerry businessman was badly roughed up by the party’s new deputy for Fingal, Duncan Smith.“I’m not going to be lectured on understanding workers. I do not have to put on a political costume and a caricature to pretend I am working class, like some,” Smith told the Healy-Rae brothers during his excoriating contribution.Cost of livingSo, when Labour brought forward a motion on the rising cost of living, Michael saw his chance to get one back for the team.“The people who are moving the motion are the people who wanted to put a water tax on everybody in this country and said they’d turn off the water if they did not pay the tax. These are the people who did away with the death grant you attacked every woman in this country you did away with their pensions you hurt them beyond belief.”A noisy shouting match ensued between MHR and the Labour duo of Brendan Howlin and Jed Nash.Michael repeatedly asked Howlin to shut up. He said Howlin and his crowd are nothing like the “old Labour” they once had in Kerry, people like Breeda Moynihan-Cronin and the Spring family. There were “good people”.This has the makings of an excellent feud."},{"url":null,"title":"coveney expresses full support in d%C3%A1il for defence forces chief of staff","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveney has expressed his full support in Defence Forces chief of staff Lieutenant General Seán Clancy after he was photographed meeting with the Russian ambassador to Ireland.

Such an outcome would be calamitous, and result in a vicious class and cultural war from which the country would never recover.There are now just two viable options if the party is to bounce back. The first is for Boris Johnson to remain in office, attempt to fix the immediate damage caused by Partygate, and then recant his worst policies and delegate huge amounts of power to a David Frost-like CEO in No 10. We would need the old Boris back: he would have to ditch the National Insurance increase, embrace a freeze on public spending and accept major shifts to his green agenda. There would need to be a clear-out of the Cabinet as well as advisers, with all the neo-socialists, green fanatics and pro-woke crowd exiting immediately.Every policy would need to be judged on whether it makes Brexit Britain more competitive, andor by how it improves the lives, and addresses the fears, of culturally conservative and aspirational Britain. The aim would be to ruthlessly target the 43.6 per cent of the electorate who voted Tory in 2019, but by following the broadly conservative approach these voters expected, rather than the weird blend of reheated neo-Brownite social democracy and green paternalism that was unleashed upon them instead.Crucially, the about-turn I’m describing is not about lobbing a few shreds of “red meat” to a starving base, penning random “Right-wing” tweets announcing a policy that unravels within hours, or even replacing a few figures in No 10 or Whitehall. No, only a total reset will do.The second option, regrettably, would be for Johnson to step down and be replaced by somebody who follows an improved version of the 2019 strategy. This inidual would need to grip a machinery of state recaptured by the Blob – and even more so now civil servants have been tasked with potentially terminating the careers of elected politicians. He or she would then need to impose, at great speed, an agenda that fuses pro-capitalist reforms while appealing to suburban cultural conservatives with a tough agenda on crime, human rights, wokery, Brexit and much else besides.Reverting to a Cameron-Osborne, Southern hoodie-and-husky-hugging approach would be calamitous, delivering even less than it did in 2010 or 2015: the metropolitan elites have shifted to the Left because of Brexit, the woke revolution and other factors, and in any case, Cameron was only successful when he briefly tacked “Right-wards”, taking on the SNP and promising a referendum.All other options for the Tories are a guaranteed disaster. Indeed, a failure to seize the moment risks jeopardising the PM’s two historic achievements: Brexit, and the political realignment which returned the Tories to levels of support last seen in the 1980s, giving them a mandate to reverse the UK’s decline.On Brexit, the job is a quarter done. We’ve left that dreadful, amoral technocratic entity de jure, although Northern Ireland remains unresolved. But de facto the only significant changes have involved immigration and foreign policy. Yet the former is being ruined by a shocking inability to control illegal arrivals from France, and the latter, a hugely significant and laudable gain delivered by Liz Truss, doesn’t affect normal people’s lives sufficiently.Yes, Truss has signed trade deals, but – through no fault of her own – she has been prevented from being as liberal as she could have been. All the other tweaks to the acquis communautaire post-Brexit could have been delivered by Labour. It would be extremely easy to rejoin the single market tomorrow given how little true ergence has taken place.Brexit can only deliver its potential if it is accompanied by a series of radical reforms. Yet for all of Johnson’s boosterism, the structure of the state remains unchanged the antiquated nature of the civil service untackled the tax system has become ever less pro-enterprise and pro-growth Britain is a worse place to do business than it was five or 10 or 20 years ago there is more regulation, rather than less freeports have been adulterated beyond recognition the planning system is a joke the universities are a mess and the schools in decline and the NHS is imploding as a result of systemic institutional failure, absurd gigantism and lethally misplaced incentives.This is madness. We need revolutionary shifts in a range of areas, from the precautionary principle to tax to reporting rules to the regulation of financial services: in each case, the UK needs to be the best place in Europe (and hopefully, the world) to hire, set up or expand a business, erect a new factory or recruit scientists. Unless all of this happens, the establishment drumbeat that Brexit has been a failure will grow ever louder, there will be hundreds of academic papers seeking to “prove” this “lack of success”, and by the late 2020s a Labour government will feel sufficiently emboldened to sign back up to myriad European initiatives. The Tories must erge so much that this becomes impossible.The Great Realignment is the other one of Johnson’s achievements that must be salvaged from the ruins of Partygate: the creation of a new coalition for the 2020s and beyond, consisting of Brexiteers, Thatcherites, blue collar workers, suburbanites, the aspirational lower middle classes (including a growing number of ethnic minorities) and wealthier Southern shire-dwellers. That coalition, at its widest, is stronger than the urbanwokeScottish nationalist alliance that Labour can deliver. The 2019 election saw people – especially in the North – who should previously have been Tories because of their lifestyle, interests and beliefs finally make the jump. This coalition is now in crisis, and must urgently be rebuilt.It can sometimes make sense to play for time in the hope that something turns up. This nightmare is different. The Conservative Party must urgently stop this catastrophic drift, or face the prospect of complete ruination.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: Boris Johnson must publish \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report in full and not \u0026#39suppress\u0026#39 it, warn Tory MPsUkraine latest news: US has not met key demands, says Russia \u0026#39Total rhubarb\u0026#39: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he approved evacuation of Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animalsFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?The Maida Vale hero should not be left dangling on police bail for a monthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shakespeare del boy gave us phrases live longest","story":"When did you last say “Pip, pip”? Some opinion-survey company has been going round asking people if they use phrases like pip, pip or dog’s dinner. Since more than half the people asked didn’t use them, the survey folk concluded that “phrases that were once commonplace in Britain are seldom used nowadays”.When was pip, pip ever commonplace? It was first used in the 1890s to imitate a car horn, but we’re all familiar with it from P G Wodehouse – Pip, pip! Toodle-oo! Tinkerty-tonk! These were seldom off the lips of Gussie Fink-Nottle, and as long as Wodehouse is read, they will remain familiar to us. We’re not going to start using them seriously, only jocularly or with invisible inverted commas.“The survey’s a bit of a dog’s dinner, scientifically,” says Dot Wordsworth, the Spectator’s longstanding language expert. “Even the phrase that 78 per cent said they don’t use – pearls before swine – would be recognised by most. Otherwise, the old joke (sometimes attributed, like many others, to Dorothy Parker), ‘artificial pearls before real swine’ would fall flat. But it’s as popular as ever.”So it seems wrong to think that once upon a time we scattered our speech with noble phrases from the Bible and Shakespeare, but now can only summon up secondhand wit from TV ads, even if it’s true that some authors of letters to The  end them “Simples!”, for want of anything better to put before their signature.That’s bad, and I get quite annoyed to hear “Lovely jubbly”, as though it were bound in itself to bring joy, rather than being a mere catchphrase from Only Fools and Horses. It was first used there in 1989, as a tacit adaptation of “lubbly Jubbly”, a 1950s advertising slogan for an orange-flavoured drink in a triangular-pyramid packet. In my schooldays it was sometimes frozen and sucked free of its flavour through one chewed corner.Such phrases are annoying partly because they are associated with recent decades and have gone out of fashion, like words such as groovy or fab (though that has come back in, half-ironically). But an origin in Shakespeare is little guarantee of cultural superiority. Take be-all and end-all. Often it is used to express disapproval of someone who gives himself airs, thinking himself the be-all and end-all, as though he were the only pebble on the beach. Macbeth, though, used it in quite a different sense: that it would be fine if the murder he contemplated was the end of the affair.We deploy plenty of phrases from Shakespeare, unaware of their origins. The same goes with the Bible. The skin of your teeth is now used for “a very narrow margin”. It comes from the Book of Job in the very literal translation of the Authorised Version. What Job meant by “I am escaped with the skin of my teeth” is hotly disputed, but that does not affect its common meaning today.It’s trivially true that when people heard the Bible read out in church they often picked up phrases from it. Now we share advertising slogans in common: “Vorsprung durch Technik,” I heard Tim Harford say jocularly on Radio 4’s More or Less last week. How could anyone use it not jocularly?Yet borrowed phrases take on a life of their own – or become dead metaphors, better known as clichés. On the Today programme, someone said “across the piste”. I’d like to think that the phrase originated as “across the piece” (or “across the board”, as we used to say, with reference to a bookie’s blackboard of odds for a win or place). The broadcasting classes, however, are more familiar with the ski slopes than with a piece of work, and stick to the snowy linguistic high ground.Some phrases, though, slog through the centuries with surprising tenacity. A parent today may say encouragingly to a small child that it’s time to climb the wooden hill to Bedfordshire. It might be thought to go back to 1936 when Vera Lynn released a record by that name. But Bedfordshire features in Jonathan Swift’s dramatised collection of clichés known as Polite Conversation (1738). The fashionable characters round the card table grow sleepy and Colonel Atwit says: “I’m going to the Land of Nod.” (A place mentioned in the Bible, open to an obvious play on words.) Miss Notable replies: “Faith, I’m for Bedfordshire.”For those of a less savagely satirical mind than Swift, clichés can almost seem like poetry. After all, we hardly know why we like proverbs saying obvious things. “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good,” we say cheerfully, to no apparent purpose.A proverb has made it when it starts being quoted in part: “It’s an ill wind...” “When the cat’s away...” “The proof of the pudding...” In fact, once a proverb is ground down, speakers don’t always know how to finish it. Instead of “The proof of the pudding’s in the eating thereof” (a nice archaic bolt-on), they erroneously come out with: “The proof’s in the pudding”. That’s not the extinction of an endangered phrase, just part of the endlessly playful development of language.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: Boris Johnson must publish \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report in full and not \u0026#39suppress\u0026#39 it, warn Tory MPsUkraine latest news: US has not met key demands, says Russia \u0026#39Total rhubarb\u0026#39: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he approved evacuation of Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animalsFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?The Maida Vale hero should not be left dangling on police bail for a monthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke push cancel fairy tales daylight magic","story":"Once Upon a Time there was a boy called Jack who traded in his cow for beans in order to demonstrate the merits of agri-entrepreneurship. But a wicked giant lived at the top of the beanstalk and all the exceedingly tall people were offended, so the story was banned.And Once Upon Another Time there was a sweet-natured girl whose stoical forbearance enabled her to triumph over a wicked stepmother and two ugly sisters, but her tale must never be told because all the blended families and body-shaming activists took umbrage.And now, Once Upon This Very Time, a live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has come under pre-emptive fire because, although it isn’t yet in production, it is already an affront to people of small stature and should be set alight with torches on the village green.The Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, has decried Disney for “hypocrisy” after it trumpeted its ersity by casting a Latina as Snow White, at the same time as telling a “backwards story of the seven dwarves living in a cave”.Generations of children may have been enthralled by the fable of Snow White – one of fortitude, friendship and the potentially fatal consequences of accepting unwashed fruit from strangers – but in our literal and hypersensitive age, the depiction of dwarves within this enchanted fantasyland is now an apparently justifiable cause of outrage.This is by no means the first time this favourite fairy tale has been castigated. In May of last year the newly revamped Disneyland ride, Snow White’s Enchanted Wish, fell foul of cancel culture because it mimicked the classic cartoon with an animatronic prince kissing his princess to rouse her from her poisoned slumber. Complaints about this supposed sexual assault went viral, as ill will so often does.We appear in these moments to forget the original intention of these stories. Snow White serves for the entertainment of little children who still believe a kiss makes things better. This one was a classic long before the early 19th century, when the Brothers Grimm set about collating these “crucial repositories of human understanding and culture”, as the fairy tale academic Marina Warner puts it, that were passed down in an oral tradition that predates mass literacy.To obsess over the identity politics of Snow White’s dwarves – or, say, the “sexism” of evil stepmothers and wicked witches – is to ignore the simple fact that fairy tale characters are all cartoonish caricatures whose real purpose is to serve as vessels for far deeper moral lessons.Fairy tales are full of life lessons and stern warnings about the fate awaiting those who break rules or transgress a community’s boundaries. Little Red Riding Hood’s troubles begin when she ignores her mother’s instruction to keep to the path. Beauty and the Beast is a moral primer on not judging people by their appearance – especially when they are excessively rich. We lose the importance of these lessons if we begin to tamper with the characters that deliver them.Viewing ancient myths through a modern lens should enhance our understanding of our forebears and societal mores. Redacting their folk tales of evil queens and gallant knights is worse than letting daylight in on magic it is to drive a fairy coach and horses through a fantastical world that still has the power to bewitch us today.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: Boris Johnson must publish \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report in full and not \u0026#39suppress\u0026#39 it, warn Tory MPsUkraine latest news: US has not met key demands, says Russia \u0026#39Total rhubarb\u0026#39: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he approved evacuation of Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animalsFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?The Maida Vale hero should not be left dangling on police bail for a monthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris should stay","story":"More from NewsSue Gray latest news: Boris Johnson must publish \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report in full and not \u0026#39suppress\u0026#39 it, warn Tory MPsUkraine latest news: US has not met key demands, says Russia \u0026#39Total rhubarb\u0026#39: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he approved evacuation of Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animalsFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?The Maida Vale hero should not be left dangling on police bail for a monthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chelsea flower show goes back roots rules put plants paving","story":"You might assume the clue was in the name - but the Chelsea Flower Show is setting a quota to make sure its gardens have enough flowers.A new category sets a minimum level of plant area for the first time in bid to refocus attention on greenery rather than the elaborate pavilions and water features that have come to characterise the show\u0027s competitive gardens.The All About Plants category, introduced this year, requires designers to use 75 per cent of the available space on living plants instead of hard landscaping such as paths or buildings.The four gardens are each raising awareness of a charity, with the good causes including mental health support for mothers, sustainable fashion and the benefits of nature for children.Lottie Delamain, whose garden for the charity Fashion Revolution focuses on the environmental impact of the fashion industry, said the plant-focused designs were more relatable for the show\u0027s visitors.Plants have got to be the star of the show in this category, which is a really fun challenge.On a practical level for visitors, it\u0027s quite nice to see a garden that is predominantly plants because it\u0027s a much more affordable way of gardening, it\u0027s a much more sustainable way of gardening. I hope it will be a bit more realistic for people to recreate at home, she said.Chelsea\u0027s major show gardens often feature elaborate water features, paving, pergolas and even buildings.She added that the hundreds of thousands of pounds of hard landscaping in Chelsea\u0027s usual gardens can kind of detract from the plants.I\u0027m not taking away from those gardens at all, they\u0027re absolutely amazing, and they are the pinnacle of garden excellence, but I think for this category what they were trying to do was go back to plants being the focus of gardens.The gardens will also be displayed inside the Great Pavilion marquee, the first time this has been done.To create a garden in the indoor setting, gardeners are building plants up on stages and introducing lighting to make sure the plants can be seen in dim evening light.The Great Pavilion is normally used to host displays of plants, with stands in previous years dedicated to roses, dahlias and fruit and vegetable produce, while show gardens are located outdoors.But organisers decided that the focus on unusual and specialist flowers meant the new category\u0027s gardens were better suited to accompany the indoor displays.These include Rubus lineatus, a bramble with white flowers and silver leaves, Aloe striatula, a type of aloe that can handle UK weather, and Isatis tinctoria, which produces the traditional blue dye woad.Polly Wilkinson, whose garden “This too shall pass” is designed around the mental health challenges of motherhood, said the new category reflected a growing interest in making gardens more nature-friendly.This is the first time where plants are the focus - well, they\u0027re always the focus, but it\u0027s playing to those rules of really limiting the hardscape and really focusing on giving that space over to plants.Any opportunity to promote how a garden doesn\u0027t have to be a lawn and pathways, and can actually be stuffed with very joyful plants, is a lovely opportunity to do that.Chelsea was held in the autumn last year due to Covid-19 but will return to its usual May date this spring.A spokeswoman for the RHS said the category had been introduced to support growers, particularly those of specialist or unusual plants.The designers have been encouraged to use interesting planting combinations and so the category is about showing off the many different plants out there and the ones you might not usually see at RHS Chelsea.In the gardens, these unusual plants have been used to highlight a good cause and so the gardens show the many positive powers of plants in all their forms.More from NewsSue Gray latest news: Boris Johnson must publish \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 report in full and not \u0026#39suppress\u0026#39 it, warn Tory MPsUkraine latest news: US has not met key demands, says Russia \u0026#39Total rhubarb\u0026#39: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he approved evacuation of Pen Farthing\u0026#39s animalsFrom face mask rules to travel - everything you can and can\u0026#39t do as restrictions change in EnglandWhy might Russia invade Ukraine and what could happen next?The Maida Vale hero should not be left dangling on police bail for a monthMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"6 questions everyone needs sue","story":" questions everyone needs Sue Grays report to answer - but it might not answerTop civil servant Sue Gray plans to send a full report to No on lockdown-busting gatherings imminently - after deciding it would not prejudice a police probeSue Gray is a top civil servant Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan It was another day of chaos at Downing St as Boris Johnsonaposs government continued the wait for Sue Grayaposs report into the Downing Street lockdown-busting gatherings. Ms Gray, a top civil servant, is due to set out the facts around a string of gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall in  . The Mirror understands Ms Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. These facts could be enough by themselves for reasonable people to decide the PM either followed - or broke - lockdown rules. But Ms Gray might not actually say in black and white that the Prime Minister broke the rules. That’s because her terms of reference state “any matters relating to the conduct of Ministers” will have to “follow the process set out in the Ministerial Code.” The Ministerial Code adds: “It is not the role of the Cabinet Secretary or other officials to enforce the Code.” Instead that is for Lord Geidt, the Independent Advisor on Ministerial Interests, who can only start an investigation with Boris Johnson’s permission… and who can have his findings overruled by Boris Johnson.  Did Boris Johnson break the law  At the time of many of the gatherings, it was illegal to gather indoors for social reasons with people not in your household. A key defence will be whether the PM and officials believed birthday and Friday night gatherings were “reasonably necessary for work” - an exemption under the law. Ms Gray’s report could shed light on this. If the facts she sets out indicate to most reasonable people that the Prime Minister might have broken the law, it will add huge pressure on him to resign. But she will not say in concrete terms whether or not Mr Johnson broke the law - that is a job for police, not civil servants. Police are now investigating a “number of” gatherings, and it will be up to them whether to issue fixed penalty notices against the PM or staff. But they could take months to report.  Was Boris Johnson warned about the May  ‘BYOB’ party or not  One of the key contested claims is about the ‘bring your own booze’ party in the Downing Street garden on  May , when outdoor gatherings were banned. Mr Johnson has admitted attending for  minutes but claimed he thought it was a work event. Crucially, he has denied being warned in advance that the event could break the rules. This is disputed by ex-aide Dominic Cummings. He backed up claims by a former No staffer who, according to the Sunday Times, believed “at least two people” told the Prime Minister it was “a party” and should be immediately cancelled. Mr Cummings said a senior staffer replied to an e-mail invite from top aide Martin Reynolds, voicing concerns, and that Mr Reynolds promised to raise that with the PM. Will Ms Gray’s report blow this defence apart  We don’t know. It’s a crucial question.  Are there photos of Boris Johnson with wine  According to Sky News, Ms Gray has been handed photos of Boris Johnson with bottles of wine at one gathering. But earlier this week, it was thought she was unlikely to include any such photos in her report - which was more likely to be presented in text form. She could, perhaps, allude to any such photos in the text of a report. But not publishing them would leave questions about exactly what evidence she received. It would also risk any such photos leaking out in a steady “drip drip” of revelations after the report was meant to put the issue to bed. Dominic Cummings - who Ms Gray questioned - has also claimed there are more photos yet to come out. Are there more incriminating text messages and e-mails  A bomb was lit under the Partygate scandal when ITV News published an e-mail from Martin Reynolds to more than  staff inviting them for a drink. The Mirror also revealed that No staff had “wine time Fridays” programmed into their electronic calendars. But other than that, many of the revelations have been based on sources and eyewitness accounts rather than documents. If Ms Gray reveals more incriminating emails or texts - especially any that involve Boris Johnson - it could be a fatal blow for some people’s careers. But it’s thought she is unlikely to write sweeping annexes of full streams of messages, or to name the staff who require disciplinary action. So there are questions over how far the report will get to the bottom of this in the eyes of the public. Were there gatherings in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s private flat  On multiple occasions since early December, claims have emerged of gatherings being held against lockdown rules in the private flat Boris and Carrie Johnson share above  Downing Street. Each time these have emerged, they have been denied as categorically untrue by the Downing Street and Mrs Johnson’s press operations. We don’t knowMs Gray has been told the same claims that were made to the press, including the Mirror. Butshe has - andshe were to make a ruling on whether the claims were true - that could be explosive for the PM and his we.

Instead they were given bleak advice for each worker to bring “your own personal mini-buffet” during the third lockdown in Spring . The guidance still appeared to be in force in November  - even after most legal restrictions were lted. Downing Street has tried to defend a cake-sharing gathering for the PM’s birthday on  June  by saying it was a “brief moment” between meetings.  Staff, the PM’s interior designer and his we Carrie gathered in the Cabinet Room in  Downing Street during the first lockdown, while indoor socialising was still illegal. Now Covid guidance for Department for Work and Pensions staff, leaked to the Mirror, appears to show the gulf between the Prime Minister’s behaviour and that expected from junior workers. The document, issued during the pandemic, described arrangements for “religious festivals, birthdays and retirements etc”.  It said “buffets and food sharing etc” were “not possible” due to “restrictions around hygiene and keeping your distance from other people”. It added: “There are alternatives you can consider such as bringing your own personal mini-buffet, finding a suitable socially distanced area where you can eat your own food together but stay safely apart, whilst ensuring suitable hand hygiene.” The guidance even told workers to “avoid passing cards physically to colleagues” and consider making a charity donation instead. And it said: “Any get-togethers for meals   drinks etc. outside the office should meet current Government and Devolved Administration guidelines.” The Jobcentre worker told the Mirror: “We in the lower levels of civil service specically weren’t allowed to arrange events based on sharing food. “So it wasn’t just  minutes and a bit of cake for Boris Johnson - it was a kick in the teeth. It’s relatively small in comparison to people who have lost loved ones. “But for civil servants at the very bottom to be following strict guidance while doing a gruelling job, as those at the top laughed and ate cake and drank wine together to let off steam, feels really unfair to me.” A senior DWP manager e-mailed the guidance to staff to remind them ahead of Christmas in November , four months after England’s ‘Freedom Day’. He wrote: “The use of DWP premises for holding any sort of s apart from normal business was curtailed some years ago due to an incident at a party.“At this time and given the current Coronavirus guidance, the holding of social s on a DWP site is not permitted.”The guidance added: “The best present is to know we have kept each othersafe from coronavirus.” The DWP was approached for comment on the leaked guidance.

Campaigners have accused Ms Truss of exuding “shocking privilege” by riding an “outrageous source of carbon emissions”. Ms Truss set off for Australia on January  at noon from London’s Stansted Airport. Her private journey had two pit stops, according to flight data, with one -minute stop at Dubai and another at Kuala Lumpur. She touched down in Sydney shortly after midnight on Thursday January  - with her journey being catalogued by a taxpayer-funded PR photographer. If she had travelled via business class on a Qantas Airways flight, the Foreign Secretary could have arrived in Australia five hours earlier.  And she would not have spent as many carbon emissions because the flight from London would have taken her straight from London Heathrow to Adelaide, Australia. An aviation source told the Independent the cost of operating Ms Truss’s trip would have been “at least £,”, while the most expensive business-class tickets which also offers lie-flat beds would have been cost just over £,. A Foreign Office source told the Mirror Ms Truss needed to fly privately so she can work securely and have the flexibility to set off to another destination in the event of crisis in other regions escalating, such as Eastern Europe. Ms Truss used the private Airbus A to, from and around Australia, the newspaper said. It has luxury interiors including spacious soft cream-coloured seats that fold into lie-flat beds. The plane could seat around  people without luxury configuration, and even with luxury seats fits scores of passengers. The Foreign Office has not said how many people were in Ms Trussapos delegation. Emblazoned with the Union flag and the words United Kingdom, it is thought to be a privately-owned plane that is regularly leased to the government for official journeys.The same aircraft rushed Boris Johnson back from the COP summit in Glasgow to London in November, in what Labour branded “staggering hypocrisy”. The PM could have caught a train but taking the flight allowed him to make a dinner with Dailyjournalists at the men-only Garrick Club.  The plane had been due toto London anyway because it had taken the PM to the G summit in Rome, then straight on to Glasgow. At the time, No insisted it was one of the most carbon efficient planes of its size in the world”, producing % less CO than the government’s main Voyager plane. It runs on a “blend of % sustainable aviation fuel and % normal fuel, which is the maximum amount allowed and obviously the emissions will be offset”, No claimed in November. Reports claim Ms Truss spent two days meeting government officials in Australia before flying across to Adelaide where she gave a speech. She left Adelaide at .pm on January  according to Flightradar, with her plane once again refuelling at Kuala Lumpur and Dubai. Ms Truss’s plane arrived back at Stansted airport at  on January .Anna Hughes, director of Flight Free UK said: “ Liz Truss has consistently demonstrated her lack of understanding about the action that we all need to take to address the climate crisis, and this is no exception.“Flying to Australia and back on a chartered jet is shockingly privileged and an outrageous source of emissions in the current climate emergency.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “It’s necessary for the foreign secretary to travel abroad to pursue UK interests around security, trade and technology, as she did during this visit to Australia. “This trip used government transport and was fully within rules set out in the Ministerial Code.” Ms Truss landed back In London a day before Cop president Alok Sharma said world leaders must “honour promises” on climate change.Mr Sharma told a Chatham House event: “Unless we honour the promises made, to turn the commitments in the Glasgow Climate Pact into action, they will wither on the vine. SNP Environment spokesperson Deidre Brock MP said: Yet again, Liz Truss has serious questions to answer over her grotesque misuse of taxpayersapos money to fund her jet set lestyle.Taxpayers will be appalled that the Tory Foreign Secretary has reportedly wasted over half a million pounds of our money on a luxury private jet trip - and emitted tonnes of unnecessary carbon emissions during a climate crisis. Ms Truss has a history of frittering away public funds. Only recently, she was criticised for splashing out over a thousand pounds on a single lunch, which saw her quaffing high-end wines in a Mayfair private members club owned by a Tory donor. With a record like this, Lavish Liz will make a fitting successor to Boris Johnson.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Liz TrussHeathrow AirportForeign OfficeStansted Airport Ltd.Climate changePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Boris Johnson is under mounting pressure from Tory MPs to scrap the planned . per cent increase in NI contributions, as he battles to shore up his struggling premiership. The manesto-breaking tax rise was confirmed last September to tackle Covid backlogs in the NHS and to fund social care.Splits are emerging among top Tories over the hike amid alarm about the looming cost of living crisis for families. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey insisted on Thursday it would go ahead despite behind-the-scenes lobbying from some Tories for it to be scrapped.It should go ahead. That’s what’s been decided,” she told Times Radio.  “Parliament voted for the levy, it’s designed to support the NHS and future NHS support as well. It’s set to be happening in April, I see no reason why that will change. But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has taken a battering over the ongoing Downing Street partygate saga, giving angry Tories more leverage to press for the tax rise to be scrapped. In a report published today, the Commons Treasury Committee warned that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would drive up inflation.The committee pointed to an OBR forecast, stating that the policy mix chosen at this Budget will act as a boost to inflation, identying in particular the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions, and the large fiscal loosening that took place in the Spending Review.Mr Johnsonaposs aim for higher wage growth risks a wage price spiralproductivity doesnapost rise, the MPs said. The report added: The Chancellor showed that he is alert to the fiscal risks of higher inflation and higher interest rates becoming entrenched.  The Treasury should keep these risks at the forefront of their thinking when designing policies at future fiscal events. Tory Committee chairman Mel Stride said: With inflation rising signicantly, concerns about pressure on the cost of living are growing. While the Prime Minister’s ambition to promote high wage growth is worthy, focusing on increasing wages without improving productivity is likely to be inflationary, and risks contributing to a wage price spiral. The Chancellor has stated his ambition to cut taxes before the end of the Parliament. In October, there was little room for manoeuvre, but there has been positive news from the public finances since then. While further good news may help him achieve this ambition, signicant risks remain, most notably from the impact of inflation.

The welfare-slashing ex-Chancellor warned the .-point rise will come “at a time when real incomes are shrinking” in a warning shot to the Prime Minister.Mr Osborne, who cut billions from Britain’s poorest, added: “Boris got the big judgment call on Omicron right… On the economy, I’m less clear.” Angry Tory MPs are putting mounting pressure on No to scrap the rise, which together with a freeze on income tax thresholds will leave the average household £ a year worse off.On Tuesday the PM’s official spokesman insisted “the levy coming in in April” was still the plan.But today he refusedFOURtimes to guarantee the levy will go ahead on time. And he refusedTWICEto deny Boris Johnson has had discussions about scrapping the National Insurance hike. Grilled by reporters today, Boris Johnson launched a furious defence of the hike - saying it was “absolutely vital” to fix the Covid backlog and the “right thing to do”.But he too did not give a cast-iron guarantee the move would go ahead as planned. Staff will pay .% on what they earn above a £-a-month threshold from April  - up from % now - in a bid to raise £bn a year for NHS and social care.At the same time, April will see the start of a four-year freeze on income tax thresholds. The p band will start at £, and p band at £,. Combined, the Resolution Foundation says these measures will leave the average household £ a year worse off, or .% of their disposable income, in  . However, these tax hikes will hit wealthier households harder than poorer ones - cutting more than £, from the richest twentieth, compared to less than £ cut from the poorest quarter. Energy bill rises also due in April could bring gas and electricity fees to % of the entire budget for Britain’s poorest households - up from .% last year. Ex-minister David Davis has publicly demanded a rethink while Lord Frost, who quit the Cabinet over tax rises, said it was “never necessary or justied”. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman was grilled repeatedly today on whether the National Insurance rise will go ahead as planned. Askedthe PM has had any discussions about delaying the rise, he replied: “Umm, err… there are no plans to delay the levy. “Erm, I’ve said on a number of occasions now what that levy will achieve - addressing the backlog in our NHS and fixing the long-standing problems with our social care.” Asked a second time he replied: “I’m not getting into inidual discussions the Prime Minister has on specic policies. There are no plans to change the levy or alter the levy.” Askedthe PM guaranteed the levy will go ahead as planned in April, he replied: “Like I say, there are no plans to remove or delay the levy. “It’s vital we are responsible with the public finances to avoid burdening future generations with higher debt.” Asked a second time, he replied: “I can only repeat what I’ve said I’m afraid.” Asked a third time, he replied: “I’m just simply saying our position hasn’t changed, there are no plans to remove or delay the levy.” Askedit was fair to interpret that No was not ruling out a delay he replied: “I will leave that to you.” In a report published today, the Commons Treasury Committee warned that the rise in employer national insurance contributions would drive up inflation.The committee pointed to an OBR forecast, stating that the policy mix chosen at thisBudgetwill act as a boost to inflation, identying in particular the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions, and the large fiscal loosening that took place in the Spending Review.Mr Johnsonaposs aim for higher wage growth risks a wage price spiralproductivity doesnapost rise, the MPs said.Splits are emerging among top Toriesover the hike amid alarm about the looming cost of living crisis for families.

But the Prime Ministeraposs authority has taken a battering over the ongoing Downing Street partygate saga, giving angry Tories more leverage to press for the tax rise to be scrapped. Labour has slammed the National Insurance hike, only a small fraction of which will fund a plan for social care in its first three years.Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said earlier: “With inflation at its highest level in three decades, the cost of living crisis is only going to get worse in the coming months. The Prime Minister and Chancellor are whacking up business and working peopleaposs taxes at the worst possible time. With even their own Conservative MPs outraged, they should think again before the National Insurance rise hits hard in April. People are already feeling the crunch from cost of living, but the triple whammy of an imminent rise in the energy price cap, real wages falling and Tory tax rises coming down the tracks are going to make this crisis even worse.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyCabinetNHSGeorge OsborneBoris JohnsonTaxPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The top civil servant plans to send a full report to No on lockdown-busting gatherings imminently - after deciding it would not prejudice a police probe. Downing Street is expected to publish that report within hours of receiving it and the Tory leader will then rush to Parliament to make a statement. But Downing Street had still not received Sue Gray’s report as of .pm tonight. And the Commons adjourned for today at .pm - meaning Mr Johnson cannot make a statement until .am on Thursday at the earliest.  That suggests No will not publish Sue Gray’s report tonight, eventhey receive it in time, because Mr Johnson would have little chance to own the narrative in Parliament. It follows days of chaotic briefing and counter-briefing over the report after Sue Gray concluded her work into around a dozen parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. It was thought the report would have to be delayed or split in two after Scotland Yard announced it would investigate “a number of” gatherings inside No. But it then emerged Ms Gray would send her full findings to No after all.  While there were concerns it could prejudice the police investigation, lockdown offences are punished with fines so any Scotland Yard probe is unlikely to end up in court. Boris Johnson ’s spokesman indicated the delay was due to checking with police, saying: “We need assurance that nothing we’ve received cuts across the Met”. No insisted its “intention” was to publish the Sue Gray report in the same format Boris Johnson receives it. The Mirror understands Sue Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. Instead it is likely to be a detailed summary, and could recommend disciplinary action against inidual staff but this would be kept secret. Boris Johnson could be interviewed by police over the parties - the first time a sitting PM has been grilled by cops in  years. The PM’s spokesman said he was not aware of the police asking to interview the Prime Minister in relation to the Met inquiry, but as a rule Iaposm not going to be getting into iniduals who may or may not be involved. Labour could use parliamentary procedures in an attempt to force the publication of the full Gray reportMr Johnson does not release it.That could take the form of a humble address, effectively a message to the Queen demanding the publication of papers. The Prime Minister has been speaking to Tory MPs in the Commons in an attempt to shore up his position while he waits for the report. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions earlier, Mr Johnson rejected calls to resign and insisted he was getting on with the job, although he acknowledged there were people who want me out of the way. The contents of Ms Grayaposs report could play a signicant role in deciding the fate of Mr Johnsonaposs leadership. Tory critics are waiting for its findings before decidingthey will submit formal letters of no confidence in him or not.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign.Askedhe would now quit, the Prime Minister said: No. Sir Keir said: We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit. He said Mr Johnson and his Government had shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country. Mr Johnson replied: Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I donapost deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way. But he said Sir Keir wanted him out because he knows that this Government can be trusted to deliver. He added: Weaposre - and in particular I am - getting on with the job.  The issue of what form the Gray report will be published in appears to be a source of tension between the inquiry team and No . Sources close to the probe expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide. The steady stream of alleged breaches of lockdown rules have undermined the Prime Minister, but many critics have held off putting in formal letters of no confidence until Ms Grayaposs report is released. If Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, receives  letters - from % of Tory MPs - a vote on Mr Johnsonaposs leadership would be held. Robert Halfon, Tory chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said Mr Johnson needs to reset his administration. I donapost need Sue Gray or the police to tell me or my constituents of Harlow that whataposs gone on has been pretty awful, he told Times Radio. We all feel let down and disappointed.

The inquiry chief wants the report to be published in full so needs their sign off before sending it to the Prime Minister. It means Mr Johnson’s leadership is still hanging in the balance - with No  anxiously awaiting the contents of the final draft. It could even be delayed until next week, raising the prospect of already mutinous Tory MPs encouraged to take action by angry constituents this weekend.The PM also faces being interviewed by police after Scotland Yard said Downing Street parties crossed the threshold for investigation. But the Mirror can also reveal that Mr Johnson’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, downplayed down the severity of the police probe in a meeting of Government advisors on Tuesday night.  “At worst it will be like getting a fixed penalty fine for speeding, nothing to worry about,” he told them.During a rowdy PMQs, Mr Johnson rejected calls to quit as he waited anxiously for the official report into the ‘partygate’ row.The PM insisted he was “getting on with the job”, although he acknowledged there were people who “want me out of the way” for a iety of reasons.  He and his allies have been speaking to dozens of Tory MPs in his Commons office over the last  hours in an attempt to shore up his position. Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the PM of showing “nothing but contempt” for the public over lockdown parties.The ex-Director of Public Prosecutions blasted: “If he misled Parliament, he must resign.” But pressed on whether he would now quit, Mr Johnson said: “No.” Mr Starmer said: “We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit.”  The Government had “shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country”, he added. Mr Johnson replied: “Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I don’t deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way.” An indication of how damaging the Gray report could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out. Downing Street has previously said the report will be published in full - and sources close to the Gray inquiry said that was their expectation.  But ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide - and No  would only say it was its “intention” to publish the whole report. However, any attempt to hold back parts of it would be met by a barrage of criticism.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, tipped as a leading candidate to succeed Mr Johnson, said: “He’s admitted that mistakes were made and I % support him, and want him to continue as Prime Minister.”She claimed there could be “security issues” which mean parts of the Gray report are “problematic to publish”. But she stressed: “We have been absolutely clear that we will publish the findings of the report.” The steady stream of allegations over alleged breaches of lockdown rules have rocked No . Many of the PM’s critics, from all wings and generations of the Tory party, are waiting for Ms Gray’s report before deciding whether or not to submit formal letters to trigger a confidence vote.In a warning to wavering rebels, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested there would have to be a general electionMr Johnson is ousted. However, neither John Major, Gordon Brown nor Theresa May called one when they took over in No  mid-term.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyScotland YardJacob Rees-MoggLiz TrussTheresa MayBoris JohnsonCressida DickJohn MajorGordon BrownCivil servantsPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"covid jabs vulnerable 5 11","story":"Covid jabs for vulnerable five to -year-olds to start within daysNHS England confirmed the roll-out would start by the end of the month, Monday, but it remains unclear which particular dayA -year-old having her first dose of the Pfizer jab Image: Dinendra Haria LNPByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments The roll-out of Covid jabs for vulnerable five to -year-olds is set to start within days.NHS England confirmed the vaccine roll-out would start by the end of the month, Monday, but it remains unclear which particular day.An NHS spokesperson told The Mirror: The NHS is on course to roll out paediatric doses of the vaccine to children aged five to  who are either at risk or household contacts of immunosuppressed contacts this month, as set out in a system letter that was issued  hours after the JCVI published guidance for this group. Parents had voiced frustration, including one whose son has been unable to attend school classes for two years. Justine, whose -year-old son has Down Syndrome, told the i newspaper : I feel resigned to not knowing what is going on.I had to fight for my daughter to get her vaccine, she was one of the first  to -year-olds. Now I feel like there’s nothing that I can do. I know the vials are in the UK, and some have had it, but why aren’t they all being done together ” In December The Mirror reported that children aged under  should only have the Covid vaccinetheyaposre vulnerable or live with someone who is, but the official rollout has not yet begun.  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationdecided against recommending that all five to -year-olds be offered the Covid vaccine, at this stage.It has been said more guidance will be issued in due course for this age group once further data is available and more is known about the threat the Omicron iant poses.The organisation said some , younger children could be offered the vaccine.  However, children aged  to , who are in a clinical risk group or who are a household contact of someone of any age, who is immunosuppressed, should be offered a primary course of vaccination. This will be two jabs of the -microgram doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and will be given eight weeks apart.

Debate over what causes it has passed through the centuries and now physicist Emeritus Professor Brian Tanner and historian Professor Giles Gasper, of Durham University, have come across a reference to ball lightning while exploring a medieval text written more than  years ago. The account by the th century Benedictine monk Gervase, of Christ Church Cathedral Priory, Canterbury, pre-dates the previous earliest known description of ball lightning recorded in England by nearly  years, the researchers suggest.  Writing on June , , Gervase stated that a marvellous sign descended near London. He described a dense and dark cloud, emitting a white substance which grew into a spherical shape under the cloud, from which a fiery globe fell towards the river.Prof Tanner said: Ball lightning is a rare weather event that is still not understood today.Gervaseaposs description of a white substance coming out of the dark cloud, falling as a spinning fiery sphere and then having some horizontal motion is very similar to historic and contemporary descriptions of ball lightning.  If Gervase is describing ball lightning, as we believe, then this would be the earliest account of this happening in England that has so far been discovered. Before the text was revealed, the earliest report of ball lightning from England dates back to a great thunderstorm in Widecombe, Devon, on October  . Gervaseaposs Chronicle and other works now exist in only three manuscripts - one in the British Library, and two at the University of Cambridge. The Latin text was edited by Bishop William Stubbs in  and there is no translation into English. The researchers previously examined the monkaposs records of eclipses and a description of the splitting of the image of the crescent moon. Prof Gasper said: Given that Gervase appears to be a reliable reporter, we believe that his description of the fiery globe on the Thames on June   was the first fully convincing account of ball lightning anywhere. The findings are published in the Royal Meteorological Societyaposs journal, Weather.

This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether. Here are the rules being removed today and what will remain. What restrictions will be removed when Plan B ends As of Today, Thursday, January , Covid passes for large venues will end. However, Boris Johnson said that venues would have the right to choose on whether or not they want to continue with the policy.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. Though the government no longer mandates wearing masks in any setting, Johnson added urged that people should still think about wearing a mask when in public environments, particularly in crowded or enclosed spaces. Restrictions on visiting care homes will also be eased. But Mr Javid warned that the end of Plan B shouldnapost be seen as the finish line. He urged people to continue taking protective measures including washing hands, ventilating rooms and self-isolatingpositive. Anyone who has yet to receive their Covid vaccines are also being urged to come forward. Which Covid rules will remain   Along with self-isolating for at least five full daysyou get a positive Covid test, the requirement to take lateral flow tests when travelling internationally will remain in place. While legal requirements stay in place for now, Johnson said he hoped to not have to renew self-isolation rules when they expire on March . He added that the aim is to remove the legal requirement for people to isolate after testing positive and replace it with advice and guidance as the virus becomes endemic.  For now, anyone planning to travel abroad need to book and pay for a Covid test before coming back to England - although this will change on February  from amyouaposre double-vaccinated. From now until then the test - either lateral flow or PCR - will have to be taken after you arrive back. If the test comes back positive, you need to self-isolate. Those who arenapost fully vaccinated need to book and pay for day two and day eight tests. You will also have to quarantine at home or the place youaposre staying for  full days.

Early data suggests that BA., a sub-iant believed to have emerged from a mutation of the Omicron coronavirus iant, may be both more transmissible and better able to evade vaccines than the more common BA. sub-lineage.Currently the BA. lineage accounts for % of all cases globally but in Denmark, the BA. has grown rapidly.In the last week of , it accounted for % of all Covid- cases. By the second week of , it accounted for % of cases. On Wednesday, it was reported that BA. had become the dominant strain in Denmark.In a national address on Wednesday, Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said: “There is no evidence that the BA. iant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious.”  Initial calculations by Denmarkaposs top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut, show BA. could be . times more infectious than BA.. So far, early data has not shown a dference in the risk of hospitalisation for BA. compared to BA.. There is some indication that it is more contagious, especially for the unvaccinated, but that it can also infect people who have been vaccinated to a greater extent, SSIaposs technical director Tyra Grove Krause said at the briefing on Wednesday. The BA. has been nicknamed “stealth Omicron” as it is poses a challenge for scientists to track, unlike the original Omicron that stood out on the widely-used PCR tests without the need for extra genome sequencing. The new strain shows up as being S-gene positive under PCR tests, whereas the BA. did not.  According to the World Health Organisation, BA. sequences have been reported in more than  countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Singapore and India. On Friday, the UK Health Security Agency designated BA. a “iant under investigation” – one level below a “iant of concern” – saying it could have a growth advantage. It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so itaposs to be expected that we will continue to see new iants emerge, Dr Meera Chand, incident director at the UKHSA, said. Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are signicant.  So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA. causes more severe illness than omicron BA., but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate.” In the UK, some  cases of the BA. sub-lineage have been sequenced, according to Reuters, and the UKHSA said early analysis suggested an increased growth rate compared to BA.. Imperial College London’s Tom Peacock, one of the first virologists to raise the alarm over Omicron, tweeted that very early observations from India and Denmark suggest there is no dramatic dference in severity compared to BA.. This data should become more solidin the coming weeks.”  He added that there is likely to be minimal dferences in vaccine effectiveness against BA. and BA.. Personally, Iaposm not sure BA. is going to have a substantial impact on the current Omicron wave of the pandemic. Several countries are near, or even past the peak of BA. waves. I would be very surprisedBA. caused a second wave at this point. Even with slightly higher transmissibility this absolutely is not a Delta-Omicron change and instead is likely to be slower and more subtle, he continued.

Their two sons - Ryan Aslett, , and Lewis Aslett,  - left the family home in September of last year to go to university and college, NottinghamshireLive reports. Before they moved out, the parents say they spoke to officials explaining the situation and said their sons would still need their bedrooms for when they come back for the holidays. The couple claim they were initially told this was fine, but then earlier this month they received a message saying they owed £,. as their bedroom tax had changed. Are you enduring a bedroom tax hell  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story They received £, each month from Universal Credit as well as £ from Employment and Support Allowance and Personal Independence Payment [PIP] support.The amount recipients receive towards housing costs may be reduced when a home has spare bedrooms. Bedroom tax means a claimant will receive less in housing benefit or housing cost element in a Universal Credit claim when living in a housing association or council house and deemed to have one or more spare bedrooms. The family were left in utter shock when they were told they needed to pay £,. in the dispute over bedroom tax. Philip said: We told them in August this was going to happen in September, the lady said everything was fine. The money was looking a bit dferent in November so I was a little worried. When I found out it was a shock, nobody had said we owed them money. Weaposve got welfare rights involved and itaposs been sent to the appeal stage. The couple explained they were unable to work due to their disabilities, which means they will struggle to pay the money or be able to survive off the smaller payments. Elizabeth added: I burst into tears and cried, it was so annoying.

Marc Holdsworth, , has coached Olympic medalists, Tom Daley, Jack Laugher and Matty Lee from pool to podium while secretly facing a devastating battle.Aged , the athlete was diagnosed with Friedrich’s Ataxia - a condition that attacks the nerves which control muscles around the body. This can lead to problems with balance, mobility, vision and speech. After a nasty fall earlier this month, Marc was left unable to walk without a simmer frame. He also requires surgery to repair his anterior cruciate ligament. Brave Marc had never spoken publicly about his diagnosis, but now he has revealed all to The Mirror. He said: “When I speak to the Ataxia nurses and they tell me how well I am doing, I break down. “It’s important for me to stand on my own two feet for as long as I can. “One of the reasons I don’t openly talk about it is that I don’t want to be treated any dferently because I have it. “It would mean the world to be able to keep coaching, I started ing when I was just  so it has been my le. “There’s a lot more moving around than people realise, you have to examine the es from all angles and you’re doing lots of moving between dferent people, I’m not just sitting on a chair at the side of the pool. “Not being able to do what I love is heartbreaking.” Living with Ataxia is like “constantly walking on a balancing beam” Marc says, who also suffers from muscle soreness, fatigue and hypermobility. The latter of those symptoms actually meant he was ‘fine-tuned’ to be a er in his younger years, but he knew something was wrong when he noticed he was unable to do simple things. He said: “I could do somersaults on the floor and arm stands which were great party tricks but I noticed that I couldn’t do simple things like carrying a cup of coffee from one side of the room to another. “I thought that was strange considering the amount of training I had. When I got given the news it was devastating. “The way it was explained was thatI had been diagnosed at  years old I would have been in a wheelchair by the age of . “I was really worried, I was an athlete so was immediately asking questions about what this meant. “They didn’t really have any concrete evidence of what would happen to me. “I have just been trying to keep fighting and enjoying le because it’s degenerative over time. “It’s not at a point where I need a wheelchair but I am on a restricted driving licence which is assessed every year and I have a blue badge.”  Now Marc coaches young ers at the City of Leeds Diving club but has been unable to get to the poolside for months as a result of the injury which is compounded by his condition. In a bid to help him get back on his feet as soon as possible, parents at the club have set up a GoFundMe to raise nearly £, to pay for the operation privately. Overwhelmed by the kindness and support he has had, Marc is determined to raise as much awareness as possible around Ataxia when he is finally able to walk again. Michelle Sharman, whose daughter Jaeda es at the club, is leading the fundraising efforts but admitted that before learning of his condition she thought Marc was always drunk. She said: “I didn’t know about Marc’s condition when I first met him but he always appeared drunk. “The dference in the ers since Marc joined the club is unbelievable. “Jaeda has gone from wanting to quit the sport to finding her love of ing all over again. “When he told me what he was going through it was a no-brainer that we were going to do as much as we could to help.”For more information about Ataxia click here https:www.ataxia.org.uk Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tom DaleyJack LaugherTeam GBEducationSchoolsSwimmingDiving\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So how many times can you catch coronavirus  Heres everything you need to knowMajority of those infected by Omicron in England have had Covid before Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Jan |comments Almost three years into the pandemic, most of us have either caught Covid or known someone who has been struck down by it. However, some people have been unlucky enough to catch the virus more than once. Now, an ongoing study fromReact , has found a majority of those who have been infected by the dominant Omicron strain had already been infected by the virus before.The study swab-tested thousands of volunteers in England, and found that two of every threeof the infected volunteers said they had already previously tested positive for Covid. Many of these could have been reinfected, but more work remains to be done to see how many of these are true re-infections. How many times can you catch Covid  You can catch Covid more than once. Some people - including politicians Keir Starmer and Matt Hancock - have had Covid twice, while there have also been other reports of people being infected with the virus three or even four times, sometimes just a few weeks apart.An analysis by the UK Health Security Agencypublished in December revealed that around one in  people who contracted Omicron in England have previously had Covid. Brits will be well aware of the three main symptoms of coronavirus – a new, continuous cough, a fever and a loss of taste and or smell. These are the officially recognised symptoms according to the NHS. However, with the new Omicron iant, symptoms have been described as being more similar to a common cold.

However, it’s not clear how long this initial immune response lasts after the first infection with Covid, and it can y from person to person. According to research, immunity after recovery from Covid can last from three months up to several years. But, some people can get re-infected sooner. A Yale School of Public Health study from October  noted that unvaccinated people should have immunity against reinfection for between three and  months, but this was before the emergence of Omicron. How long does it take to recover from Covid   The amount of time it takes to recover from Covid can be dferent for everybody. While many people feel better in a few days or weeks -making a full recovery within  weeks - others can experience long-Covid symptoms. These long term symptoms can last weeks or months after the infection has gone, and is not linked to how ill you were when you first caught the virus.

She told the Sunday Times : I travel a lot and I’ve always been able to make wherever I am home. If I am staying in a hotel I have the same family photographs and scented candles around me. When I’m in the UK I’m lucky enough to stay at Royal Lodge. I wouldn’t call it my home as that would be presumptuous, she added.

Weaposre orced to each other, not from each other.

Craig Mell explained that the ticket machine at a BM store carpark in Keighley in Bradford, West Yorkshire, was out of order when he tried to buy one on July , .He actually took a photo of the ticket machine in the Cavendish Retail Park so he could dispute any charge he received - but says he never got anything in the post until now, reports Yorkshire Live. The first he knew about any parking problem was when a letter from a debt collector demanding the money arrived a fortnight ago. It threatened thatCraig does not pay, the matter will be taken to court. But Craig has tried calling the parking company, called G Ltd, several times this week and has failed to get through to speak to someone.  Craig said: I havenapost lived in Keighley for very long but I had seen people always getting parking tickets from that car park. All of them have the same problem as me.

I always take a picture of the machine when itaposs out of order to make sure I can prove that it isnapost working, just in case.

Chloe Pritchard, , says pieces of wall fall off during the day, water seeps in through several windows whenever it rains, there are cracks everywhere, and her three-year-old son is staying at his grandmotheraposs because it is affecting his health. The young mother also described how there is damp in the house and holes in the wall, which are covered up by wallpaper, NorthWalesLive reports. Chloe moved into the two bedroom house in Caernarfon, Wales with her two young children last November.  The -year-old was happy to find a bigger home for her growing family and was eager to move into the house as soon as possible. She says that the house initially appeared to be an improvement on her previous home, but within days of moving in, she says she realised that a lot of work was required to make it a safe environment for herself and her children.  Three months after moving in, she claims that no progress has been made by the social housing provider Adra in remedying the problems, as she keeps on discovering more issues with the house. Chloe said: Living in this environment is horrible, especially with two children and another one on the way. I canapost stop crying, I canapost eat or sleep here - itaposs no way to live. She said that heat can escape from the house easily, which leaves her having to keep the heating switched on throughout large parts of the day.  These issues are affecting the physical and mental health of her young children, she said. My young son lives mostly with my mum because he canapost stand being in the house. Thereaposs dust everywhere form the crumbling plaster which affects him badly because of his bronchitis. We have damp, some of the plaster is wet to the touch and parts of the walls crumble off at random parts of the day. The sockets are also exposed and thereaposs holes in the walls which are obviously dangerous for young children. The children are stressed out living here. My baby girl whoaposs just turned one wonapost settle and my three-year-old boy absolutely hates coming here. Heaposs always got a cold and his asthma plays up because of how cold, damp and dusty it is here. Heaposs missing school because of it as well. He sees me stressed and heaposs at that age now where that affects him and that just builds up, said Chloe. Chloeaposs baby is due in July and she feels that she is getting nowhere despite being in constant contact with Adra. As things stand, Chloe says, they are all staying in the same room as the others are not safe for her children. I canapost let my baby girl crawl around because the floor is so rough andI was to take my eye off of her for a second she could be sticking a finger into loose plaster or a hole in a wall. Weaposre all staying in one room at the moment because I canapost have my kids in any of the other rooms given the way they are at the moment - itaposs just not safe. Iaposm constantly told by people that these are not living conditions but when I bring the issue up with Adra - something Iaposve done many times - itaposs like theyaposre not interested. Weaposve had inspectors over who acknowledge that work needs to be done on the house but they say we just have to keep on living here and wait months on end for it to be done, Chloe said. Chloe said she feels asshe has exhausted all of her options. She says that she needs Adra to act urgently and that her current situation is not tenable for the long term. Dealing with her pregnancy and all it entails on top of living in this environment, she says, is a nightmare, and she has considered handing back the keys on several occasions.The only thing that is stopping her from doing so, she says, is her responsibility to her children. Iaposve come close on so many occasions to handing my keys back to Adra and just sleep on peopleaposs sofas but obviously with the children involved I canapost do that. I donapost feel like I have any options at the moment.  A spokesperson for Adra said: Providing good customer service and making sure our customers feel safe and comfortable in their home is a priority for us. Our customer moved into this house in November as part of a mutual exchange. In January we were notied about the issues involving some of the plastering in the property. To date we have carried out an inspection at the customeraposs home and have identied the work required which will be completed by the end of February. We will make sure the work is completed to a high standard.

It contains  denials as well as  instances in which the team said it lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegations. There are also a handful of admissions in the document, in which the Duke demanded a trial by jury. Ms Gufre claims in , she was trafficked by billionaire and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with Prince Andrew in London when she was  - a minor in US law. She also alleges she was forced to have sex with the royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The mum-of-three is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which US lawyers say could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Below are the allegations made of the Duke and his responses.Claims denied by the Duke of Yorkaposs legal team The suit arises out of Defendantaposs sexual abuse of Ms Gufre when she was under the age of -years-old. She was lent out for sexual purposes to the Defendant, Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Prince Andrew was a close friend of Ghislaine Maxwell. He has refused to cooperate with US authorities in their investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his co-conspirators. Once in the residence, Epstein and his co-conspirators would work in concert to impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth and power. They would brag about their connections to very powerful political and social figures, and display photographs of themselves with those figures around Epsteinaposs homes. They would normalize the sexual abuse by displaying photographs and art displaying nude females, and a massage table and spa related products in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur. Once abused, Epstein and Maxwell continued to manipulate their victims, using their financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim ed as directed and remained compliant with their demands. Epstein and his lawyers would even gather information about the victims to use against themthey ever disobeyed him, and his homes were under constant surveillance. Message pads recovered during trash pulls at Epsteinaposs Palm Beach mansion reflect messages that his staff took to relay to Epstein. They show the constant flow of girls to Epstein, sometimes three per day. Epsteinaposs employees have also described young girls constantly being present at Epsteinaposs dferent homes. Epsteinaposs constant access to young girls is also evidenced in his aposBlack Book,apos a book of phone numbers and contact information listing girls to call for aposmassagesapos in ious cities, flight logs documenting his frequent travel with young girls and powerful iniduals on his private plane, and troves of lewd photographs of young girls recovered from his homes. In his Black Book, Epstein had at least  dferent contact numbers listed for Prince Andrew.Ms Gufre became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse after Maxwell recruited her into Epsteinaposs sex-trafficking operation when Ms Gufre was working at the Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Between  and , Epstein sexually abused Ms Gufre at numerous locations including his mansion in this District, at  East st Street, New York, New York  Epstein also flew Ms Gufre on his plane nationally and internationally numerous times when she was under the age of . After years of abuse, Epstein sent Ms Gufre to Thailand in September . One of her assignments from Epstein was to bring a young girl back to Epstein in the United States. Fearing for her le, and not wanting to subject another young girl to the abuse she was forced to endure, Ms Gufrefled from Thailand to Australia to escape from Epstein. Prince Andrew and Maxwell have been photographed at numerous social events together. According to available flight logs, Prince Andrew began flying with Epstein on his private plane as early as , when he flew with Epstein and Maxwell to Epsteinaposs private island, Little St. James. Prince Andrewaposs name also appears in other available flight log entries from around the same time, showing travel with Epstein and Maxwell to and from other locations, including West Palm Beach, Florida, and Teterboro, New Jersey. In , Prince Andrew invited Epstein to his daughteraposs th birthday party, despite Epstein being charged with procuring a minor for prostitution only one month prior. Members of Epsteinaposs house staff have confirmed witnessing Prince Andrew visit Epsteinaposs numerous homes, both to the media and in sworn testimony. The below photograph depicts Prince Andrew, Ms Gufre, and Maxwell at Maxwellaposs home prior to Prince Andrew sexually abusing Ms Gufre. In , Epstein pled guilty in Florida to the charge of procuring a minor for prostitution. Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a  interview with the New York Post. Around the same time, Prince Andrew began to face criticism over his well-publicised friendship with Epstein. In early , after Ms Gufre had publicly accused Prince Andrew of sexually abusing her, Prince Andrew emailed Maxwell stating, aposLet me know when we can talk. Got some specic questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts.apos On July , , the U.S. Attorneyaposs Office for the Southern District of New Yorkcharged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking. Epstein was arrested on July , , pursuant to a Sealed Two Count Indictment. Epstein was found dead in his cell at the politan Correctional Center on August , . Just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter aposthat criminalising sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable.apos Prince Andrew lacks sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation that there exists photographic evidence of his alleged meeting with Giuffre.As a direct and proximate result of Prince Andrewaposs criminal acts, Ms Gufre has in the past and will in the future continue to suffer substantial damages, including extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy.Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkNewsnightRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not only is she styled HRH, she is officially known as Princess Charlotte of Cambridge thanks to her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.However, it’s likely that her dad Prince William will take the throne making him King and her mum Kate Queen.And when this happens it seems that Charlotte will be in line for a unique royal title - even grander than her current one.That title is Princess Royal, which is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.  The title was first introduced to mimic the French royal title of Madame Royale back in the s. The current Princess Royal is the Queen’s only daughter Princess Anne, who was given the title in . However, royal expert and author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, Duncan Larcombe, told TownandCountrymag: “The title of Princess Royal is traditionally bestowed on the eldest daughter of the monarch.

And she applauds the St Albans headteacher who is ripping up the rulebookEva Simpson says schools should scrap their hair rulesImage: Getty ImagesopinionByEva Simpson:,  Jan |comments Like most parents on their child’s first day of ­ secondary school, I was filled with immense pride.My son looked so smart in his new unorm – blazer, tie, shirt, gleaming shoes. I took loads of pictures to show family and friends.When we arrived at the school, a teacher pointed to my son and called out “can this boy’s parent come and see me I stepped forward proudly. I didn’t expect to be singled out for how well turned out and smart my son looked on his first day of big school. “Good morning,” said the teacher. “I’m just wonderingyou read the school’s policy on hair  Your son’s haircut is in contravention of that.” I was stunned. Contravention. What was he on about My son had a perfectly normal hair cut, one that he’d had all through primary school. A short crop, similar to one sported by US President Barack Obama. But as far as the school was concerned it was an “extreme” haircut because it wasn’t a number four or above. In other words it was too short. I won’t lie, I was so upset I was on the verge of tears. Of course in typical British fashion I apologised profusely and assured him it wouldn’t happen again. But I was fuming. It immediately created a ­ision when there didn’t need to be one and left a very bad taste. There have been too many incidents of black children being penalised for hair ­“transgressions”. So I was heartened to read about St Albans headteacher Julie Richardson who has ripped up the school’s rule book on hair and thrown it out of the window.Now kids can come in with cornrows, Afros, short hair, whatever, without being put into isolation and missing valuable teaching time.Too many unorm policies around hair are ridiculous. They ignore children’s cultural heritage. Black schoolgirls for instance have sometimes been banned from having braids as they’re classed as hair extensions, even though they’re neat and mean the child can get ready for school much quicker. This fosters resentment, all to the detriment of the child. Part of the problem is the lack of ­ersity among school governors. It’s a closed shop. Many schools, especially those with a large black student body, have practically no black representation among the governing body and that needs to change. So I applaud Ms Richardson. I hope more schools take a leaf out of her book.

But some supermarkets have issued their own advice on the matter - heres what you need to knowThe face mask mandate has been scrapped as Plan B restrictions come to an end in England Image: U. Baumgarten via Getty ImagesByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |commentsCovid Plan B restrictions, which were introduced late last year to curb Omicron cases, have been scrapped from today almost in entirety.It means compulsory face masks, Covid passes and work from home guidance have all come to an end in England.Last week, Boris Johnson told the Commons that the government will no longer mandate the wearing of face masks anywhere.He added that instead of mandates, it suggests that you continue to wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.Many supermarket chains have announced their rules on face masks, with one chain saying safety remains our highest priority.Which supermarkets still need you to wear a face mask   Under Plan B, shoppers in England had to wear face masks in shops and supermarkets as well as in a range of other public indoor settings, unless they were exempt or had a reasonable excuse. The end of restrictions means that there is no longer a legal requirement to wear masks in shops.However,supermarket chain Sainsbury’swas among the first retailer to announce it is recommending all shoppers and staff continue to wear a covering unless they are medically exempt.The chain issued an update stating: Safety remains our highest priority. From Thursday, we’re asking our customers and colleagues in England to continue to wear a face covering in our storesthey are able to.Another large chain to confirm that it would be suggesting shoppers to wear masks in their stores wasJohn Lewis .A spokesperson said: We value the safety of our customers and Partners and continue to follow the latest Government guidelines, adding that it will be down to iniduals to make a personal choice.

Meanwhile, electronics retailer Currys said that while it will ask staff and delivery staff to wear masks, it wonapost tell customers to do the same. Other stores like Tesco and Aldi are likely to follow with a voluntary mask policy, where shoppers will be asked to consider wearing masks but not legally required to do so - but this is unconfirmed as these stores have not issued any update yet.What is the health guidance on using face masks   Face masks are no longer mandated in retail settings and public transport, but health guidance remains that people wear masks in crowded and enclosed spaces, where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet. Trade union Usdaw, which represents , retail workers, has also urged customers to continue to observe Covid safety measures and wear masks even though the mandate has ended. Chief executive of British Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson said: Retailers ask customers to be considerate to those around them when choosing whether to wear a face covering and to respect the decision of other customers.Similar to shops, Transport For London has already said that people must continue to wear masks on its services.

The condition means that the ligaments in Allesha’s spine are tense and tighter than usual, subsequently pulling her brain into her spinal canal which causes crippling headaches making sound and light unbearable for the teen.The potentially fatal condition can also lead to ‘internal decapitation’ or paralysis when the tension builds so much that these ligaments become severed. The former law student, whose dreams of becoming a lawyer were initially dashed by the devastating diagnosis, needed £, to fly to Spain and have an innovative new operation which will stop the malformation in her spine.

I’ve had to take the last few days just to process it. “I never thought I would even manage to raise the money I needed, never mind do it in a few days.” Allesha had started looking for answers three years ago when she was struck down with daily headaches so severe that she can’t bear to look at light or hear anything louder than a whisper.

Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has admitted he is not optimistic a Russian incursion into Ukraine can be stopped as he prepares to meet his counterpart in Moscow.Mr Wallace told the BBC from Germany there was still a chance an invasion could be halted but added: Iaposm not optimistic.The -year-old also confirmed he would soon meet with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow.It comes after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK is not ruling out support for personal sanctions against President Vladimir Putin in the event Russia invades Ukraine. Ms Truss made the comments after US President Joe Biden suggested moving to penalise the Russian president could be an option in the case of an invasion. When asked on Tuesdayhe could see himself sanctioning Mr Putin in those circumstances, Mr Biden told reporters: Yes, I would see that. Askedthe UK would support personal sanctions against the Russian president, Ms Truss told BBC Radio aposs Today programme on Wednesday that the Government had ruled nothing out. We have ruled nothing out in terms of sanctions, and in fact, weaposll be legislating to toughen up our sanctions regime and make sure we are fully able to hit both iniduals and companies, and banks, in Russia in the event of an incursion, she said. Whataposs important is that all of our allies do the same because itaposs by collective action, by showing Vladimir Putin weaposre united, that we will help deter a Russian incursion. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said Britain was prepared to deploy troops to protect Nato allies in Europe should Russia invade Ukraine, as he warned Mr Putin faced ferocious Ukrainian resistance.Asked about this on BBC Radio aposs Today, Ms Truss said: We already deploy troops in Estonia as part of our enhanced forward presence. We are looking at what more we can do. Weaposre working very closely with allies. I had a meeting with the Nato secretary-general in Brussels earlier this week to discuss that, but the UK is already at the forefront of providing forces in Estonia and providing broader support across eastern Europe. But be in no doubt, Nato is determined to increase support on the eastern flank to support our Nato allies, who of course we have strong obligations to.

The study explains thatyou do a combination of things that are in the dark red cells of the table, youaposre more likely to get Covid. The things that increase your risk are:Gathering together with lots of people in an enclosed space with poor air quality, such as an under-ventilated gym, nightclub or school classroom Doing something strenuous or rowdy such as exercising, singing or shouting Leaving off your masks Staying there for a long timeTo avoid catching Covid, the study recommends keeping in the green or amber spaces of the table.  That means: If you must meet other people, do so outdoors or in a space that’s well-ventilated or meet in a space where the ventilation is good and air quality is known.Keep the number of people to a minimum Spend the minimum possible amount of time together Don’t shout, sing or do heavy exercise Wear high-quality, well-fitting masks from the time you enter the building to the time you leaveThe study stresses that while the chart gives an estimated figure for each situation, the actual risk will depend on the specic parameters, such as exactly how many people are in a room of what size.

Cameron Newsom, , first developed a white spot on her tongue and was referred by her dentist to the local hospital for a biopsy. The spot was not painful and, when the results came back negative for any signs of cancer, she and her husband Anthony, also , and their son Hudson, , were told not to worry.But a year later, Cameron, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, developed another identical spot and was admitted to hospital again for a deeper, more invasive biopsy, Bristol Live reports. The results once again showed no signs of cancer but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots.  Months later, her tongue became sensitive and sore, and immediately contacted her dentist. She was given antibiotics to combat any potential infection but her condition continued to worsen, as the original spots had transformed into a pinkish tumour on the left side of her tongue. She was sent for further tests and a third biopsy and after being referred to an ear nose and throat specialist, Cameron was diagnosed with stage four squamous cell carcinoma – skin cancer of the tongue. Cameron said: At the time of my diagnosis Iaposd lost over seven pounds because I was unable to eat or drink. It took three years from when the first spot originally appeared for doctors to finally diagnose me - no one ever mentioned it could be oral cancer. When I was told, it seemed like I was being handed a death sentence there and then, but straight away my reaction was Iaposm ready to fight this. I was  at the time and in very good shape, so I couldnapost understand why this was happening to me.  When I got home that day I googled my type of cancer and as you can imagine the results were absolutely terrying. There were images of people after having their jaws removed or sawed in half - Iaposd never been so scared. Cameronaposs diagnosis came in May  and she was scheduled in for three rounds of chemo, starting in July and finishing in September that year. Throughout that time, she was unable to eat or drink anything without suffering excruciating pain - all whilst undergoing grueling cancer treatment. There would be times at the dinner table where I would just burst into tears because I couldnapost eat a thing, she said.results showed no signs of cancer - but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots. Hudson, who was five at the time, didnapost know why I was always so upset and it got to the point where I couldnapost physically speak to him or my husband. A low point for me was when I went to a party with all my closest friends and I had to leave because my mouth was in so much pain. I went home and took a shower to calm down, and thataposs when clumps of my hair started falling out - it was so upsetting. Thankfully for Cameron, her chemotherapy was successful and as a result the tumor had shrunk a considerable amount. Her body had reacted well to the treatment, but the next part of her recovery was to have the tumor completely removed. She then flew back and forth to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas to meet with some of the best oral surgeons in the country and organise the operation. On December , Cameron went under the kne, and oral and plastic surgeons worked together to remove the left side of her tongue. In what was a nine-and-a-half hour operation, they then replaced that part of her tongue with skin and muscle tissue from her thigh. Surgeons then performed a Tracheotomy on Cameron, where they sliced a hole between her two collar bones and inserted a tube into her neck so she could breathe. The mum also had a feeding tube taped to her nose so she could ingest vital calories which were desperately needed to help her body recover. Read More Cameron said: They usually take skin from your forearm, but I’m only five foot two, so I didn’t have enough skin on my forearm to replace what I was having removed. However, Iaposve been an athlete all my le, and there was plenty for them to use from my thigh - so thataposs what we decided to do. The oral surgeon removed part of my tongue, and the plastic surgeon took muscle and skin from my thigh to replace it. When I woke up I had tubes coming out my neck and nose which allowed me to breathe and eat. The next few weeks were hell because my mouth was so swollen I couldnapost swallow or breathe unassisted. I had to be under constant observation and every time my throat had a build up of blood and body fluid, it had to be flushed away using water. That was basically like being waterboarded by the nurses once or twice a day which was absolutely horric. The weirdest part of the whole experience was when I felt a rough texture on the thigh part of my tongue - and when I looked in the mirror it had started growing leg hair! For nine weeks after her surgery, Cameron underwent  rounds of radiation and another three rounds of chemo to rid of any remaining cancer cells. In that time she was unable to speak, and for six months had to use a tube inserted in her stomach to eat and drink whilst her wounds healed. From then on, Cameron started getting used to le with her new tongue - which included relearning how to speak, chew, drink and swallow. I had to teach myself how to speak again after the radiation therapy which was a really bizarre feeling, she said. I can only taste on the right side of my tongue which is the real side, and only chew on the right side because the left is attached to my gums. My manners are terrible because food sometimes just falls out my mouth, and when food gets stuck underneath my tongue it feels like having a small rock in your shoe. Because the left side is sewn to my gums I donapost have the full range of motion I used to which can be frustrating. A feeling I could compare it to is like having a dead arm or dead leg all the time - it is constantly tingly and numb. Only the healthy side produces saliva and I cant stick my tongue out my mouth at all, so licking things is a big no no! Itaposs now been nine years since my diagnosis and thereaposs been no signs of regression. The longer you go without regressing the less likely it is the cancer will come back, so were all feeling really positive.  was the toughest year of my le and I couldnapost of done it without the support of my amazing Antony and the rest of my family. In June , once she proved she could eat and drink unaided, Cameron ed to her job as a gymnastics coach and was finally able to start living le again. She has since mentored several other people whoaposve been diagnosed with the same cancer as she was, offering them support and guidance throughout their treatment.

The photo, which has been dubbed “Nessie in Wimbledon Park Lake”, captures a black outline in the water that looks exactly like the mythical beast. It’s particularly evocative of the famous “surgeon’s photograph” from  – supposedly the first image to capture the giant creatureaposs neck and head.Arek Chytros, who took the new “Nessie” photo, said he snapped it while strolling by the lake one morning. It picked up hundreds of likes and dozens of comments when he shared it online. “My goodness,” wrote one person. “Awesome,” said another.Do you believe in Nessie  Have your say in the comment section But it was not taken so seriously by others. One Londoner wrote: “That’s an escaped elephant. Anyone missing any ” Another said: “F***ing wild swimmers!” And one Scot commented: “On behalf of all Invernessians living in London, I can confirm that we endorse this message.” Others proposed that Arek had seen a cat, an exhaust system, a wheelbarrow or a Boris bike. While one person quipped that Nessie “took a holiday”.  The original “surgeon’s photograph” made headlines at the time, but is now believed to have been an elaborate hoax. It was apparently created using a toy submarine with wood putty attached, fashioned into a head and neck. For Arek, however, the hoax is not so elaborate. “It’s a tree,” he said. “As soon as I spotted it I thought of Nessie hence I snapped a picture.”  But Arek, a construction site manager, is keeping an open mind as to whether an actual Loch Ness Monster exists. “You never know what’s hiding in the unknown,” the -year-old said. “If a real Nessie exists then it’s gotta be some dinosaur that refused to go extinct. “I’d like to think that it does exist.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Loch Ness MonsterDinosaurs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As it spins through space it sends out a beam of radiation, and for one minute in every twenty minutes it is one of the brightest objects in the sky. Researchers think the object could be a neutron star or a white dwarf - collapsed cores of stars - with an ultra-powerful magnetic field.Astrophysicist Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker, of Curtin University, International Centre for Radio Astronomy Researchin Australia, who led the team that made the discovery, called it spooky. She said: This object was appearing and disappearing over a few hours during our observations. That was completely unexpected. It was kind of spooky for an astronomer because thereaposs nothing known in the sky that does that. And itaposs really quite close to us - about , lightyears away. Itaposs in our galactic backyard. Dr Hurley-Walker added that the observations match a predicted astrophysical object called an ultra-long period magnetar. She said: Itaposs a type of slowly spinning neutron star that has been predicted to exist theoretically. But nobody expected to directly detect one like this, because we didnapost expect them to be so bright. Somehow itaposs converting magnetic energy to radio waves much more effectively than anything weaposve seen before. Curtin University Honours student Tyrone OaposDoherty discovered the object using the Murchison Widefield Arraytelescope in outback Western Australia - and a new technique he developed. He said: Itaposs exciting that the source I identied last year has turned out to be such a peculiar object.

Objects that turn on and off in the universe are not new, and astronomers call them transients, with some appearing over the course of a few days and disappearing after a few months, and others flashing on and off within milliseconds or seconds. However, ICRAR-Curtin astrophysicist and co-author Dr Gemma Anderson said finding something that turned on for just a minute made the new discovery unusual. She explained that the mysterious object was incredibly bright and smaller than the sun, emitting the kind of radio waves that suggested it had an extremely strong magnetic field. The researchers are now monitoring the object to seeit switches back on, and plan to search for ore of these unusual objects in the vast archives of the MWA. More detections will tell astronomers whether this was a rare one-off event or a vast new population weaposd never noticed before, Dr Hurley-Walker said. The findings are published in the Nature journal.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

everyone ,you see someone wearing the badge or lanyard, give them the space and consideration that they are asking for.”Latest casesNicola Sturgeon also updated the Scottish parliament over the latest

deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed

It#s so heartening to experience the children#s energy, enthusiasm and awe when learning about whales and dolphins.Our sessions are so important as they spark passion and interest in the local environment and encourage conversations about the actions that we can all take to help protect it, now and in the future.Players of People#s Postcode Lottery have supported the charity, raising £, since  to support the development and delivery of new and immersive learning experiences that bring the marine environment to le for children in coastal communities.Our latest creative project, funded by People#s Postcode Trust and Sea-Changers, has been to launch the best of their education sessions online, working with schools and home educators across Scotland and England.Based around the trust#s research expeditions, these digital sessions introduce the amazing ersity of whales, dolphins and sharks in Scotland and give children a glimpse into what it is like to work at sea, studying and protecting ocean giants.Prior to the pandemic, every year school groups would join the charity#s crew on board their research vessel, Silurian, as she was temporarily transformed into a floating classroom.The famous yacht has now visited communities on most of the larger Hebridean islands including Mull, Skye, Islay, Lewis, Harris, Uist, Barra, Coll, Tiree and the Small Isles as well as some of the largest towns along Scotland#s west coast, such as Oban, Mallaig and Ullapool.Raising awareness and aspirations for green careers features at the centre of the charity#s education strategy.Each year the trust runs dedicated research expeditions for - and -year-olds on board Silurian.These young adults gain hands-on experience monitoring marine le, including collecting data as part of the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust long-term citizen science project, which informs local and national conservation efforts.Anyone can help the charity monitor marine le, by reporting their sightings of cetaceans – the collective name for whales, dolphins and porpoises – and basking sharks online.The trust also offers guided field trips for schools, so that younger children can take part and experience the thrill of spotting seabirds and marine mammals from land.Local wildle is not only amazing to see, but each species also has an important biological role to play.By protecting whales and giving marine ecosystems the chance to recover, we can improve the health and resilience of our seas and in turn the climate and planet for us all.We#re really proud to support the next generation of ocean ambassadors and look forward to when Silurian can once again become a floating classroom and set sail for island schools.In the meantime, teachers or home educators keen to take part in our online sessions are encouraged to get in touch by emailing info@hwdt.org"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 7 2022","story":"He followed a very dferent path.

At that time, the local authority said the land was allocated for “circa  homes”.However, Persimmon Homes has gone beyond that figure and is looking to create a residential development of “circa  units”.Twenty-five per cent of the properties, which would include terraced, semi-detached and detached homes, would be classed as affordable.Access to the new homes would come from two new junctions created on Lammermoor Terrace, while a SUDSwould be created in the east of the site.Various studies will make up part of any application to the council.If the scheme is eventually approved, the developer will have to agree a sum for contributions to a range of projects, including extending both Windygoul Primary School and Ross High School.A sum would also be agreed “towards the enhancement of community sports facilities at Polson Park”.Money would also go towards covering the impact on a number of junctions, including Bankton Junction onto the A.Representatives from Persimmon Homes East Scotland were available to answer any questions about the scheme last Thursday afternoon.A spokesperson for the company revealed that nearly  people attended the online event.They said: “We hope local residents found it helpful:  attended and  questions were asked.“The most frequently raised concerns were general disruption during construction and extra local traffic on Birsley Road and Lammermoor Terrace.“Anyone who was unable to join the consultation can find out more about the proposed development by going to persimmonhomes lammermoor-terrace and sites.google view lam mermoor-terrace“Those wishing to comment can still do so by submitting an email or via post before January .“We will be reviewing all comments and how they can be addressed within the next stage of our planning application to East Lothian Council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-railway-station-office-opening-hours-slashed","story":"Opening hours of the office at the station, which links the county with the north of England as well as Edinburgh, could be reduced by nearly  hours per week.The idea is being weighed up by ScotRail, which operates more than , train services through  stations throughout Scotland.Fewer than  stations have staffed ticket offices, with Dunbar making up part of that number.The move has been criticised by rail union RMT and the county’s MP Kenny MacAskill and MSP Paul McLennan.RMT is “wholly opposed” to cuts to ticket offices and believes that these will deter passengers from the rail network and make it less accessible for disabled and elderly passengers.They claim that cuts to ticket office hours worsen passenger service, safety and security by reducing the times that staff are guaranteed to be present at stations and make it far easier for operators to reduce overall staffing levels in the future.Mick Lynch, general secretary, said: “Cuts to ticket office hours will do nothing to restore passenger confidence in Scotland’s sustainable rail network, which has a central role to play in delivering modal sht away from high-carbon transport.“These proposals affect nearly all of the ticket offices in Scotland and will undoubtedly worsen passenger service and accessibility, as well as turning many of our stations into a mugger’s paradise.”Mr MacAskill backed the RMT in opposing the reduction in hours.Currently, the booking office – the only one of its kind in East Lothian – is open from .am to .pm from Monday to Friday.The proposed changes would see the office open at .am and shut at .pm with the exception of Friday, when it would close  minutes earlier.Changes would also be introduced on a Saturday and Sunday.The booking office opens at .am on a Saturday and shuts at .pm, with opening hours of .am to .pm on a Sunday. The changes would mean a am opening on Saturday, with a closure of pm, while Sunday would retain its opening time but shut at .pm.Mr MacAskill said: “As a regular user of the station, I share the views of RMT.“It’s a retrograde step.“The staff are helpful and essential, evenI’m often just picking up tickets from a machine.“It’s only Dunbar as others are unmanned but it’s a major station for the county.”Paul McLennan, who is East Lothian’s MSP as well as a councillor for the Dunbar and East Linton ward, encouraged people to take part in the consultation.He said: “Dunbar residents have less than three weeks to make their views known on the proposed changes to the ticket office opening times.“The changes to opening times at the weekends are the most signicant and will likely impact residents who travel to Edinburgh from Dunbar socially in the evening.“Last year, the community response from Dunbar residents was a driving force in the delaying of the proposed changes to rail services in East Lothian as part of the new East Coast Mainline timetable.”ScotRail offered a breakdown on how people purchased their tickets.More than  ticket vending machines have been installed across the country, with more than a quarter of all ticket sales coming through the machines.Internet access also accounts for about  per cent, with the number of people using ticket offices dropping from  per cent in  to  per cent in .According to ScotRail, the proposed changes would impact on  stations across the country.A spokesperson said: “Some locations may see minor changes whilst other locations may see reduced opening hours to align with customer usage.

spreading.”For those who have symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test, evenyou have a positive lateral flow test.However, from January ,a lateral flow test is positive, and the person does not have symptoms, they will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result.Instead, the person concerned must immediately isolate and also report their result online so that Test

a sixth waste receptacle to households late last year as it looked to improve kerbside collections.And at a meeting of the council’s cabinet on Wednesday, its head of infrastructure Tom Reid hailed the new service as a success.He told the cabinet that although figures were still not available to compare the impact of the additional collection, the council was producing “industry-leading” material.He said: “While other local authorities are having to pay to have recycling waste separated, we are not.”The council introduced white weighted bags to homes for them to “wash and squash” plastic bottles, tins and cartons into as it increased collections in November.The bags join a food waste caddy, green household waste bin, brown garden waste bin, a blue box for paper and card, and a green or black box for glass bottles and jars.Mr Reid acknowledged that some teething problems had been encountered when the new bags were first introduced, along with new weekly collections, due to the impacts of Brexit and Covid.However, he said that they had quickly resolved issues and the service was now working well, although he said figures for the new recycling service would be unlikely to be available until the end of the financial year.The East Lothian system sees vehicles, adapted to empty the dferent receptacles into separate compartments, introduced to allow more regular kerbside

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion.

Declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in , its one of the best examples of Nabataean culture, drawing comparisons with Jordans historical gem, Petra.Travelling in a vintage x, we drive through the sprawling, dusty site, admiring towering facades decorated with reliefs of eagles, snakes and stairways to heaven. Encasing the portals, a honeycomb lattice of rock appears to have been melted by the sun like a giant waxy candle.Most tombs belonged to women - indicating females enjoyed an elevated status in Nabataean society - a point poignantly stressed by our local guides.Other archaeological sites of interest in AlUla include the ruins of Dadan, dating back roughly to the first millennium BC, and Jabal Ikmah, an open-air library of ledgers and notes etched into the rocks. Described by our guide as \"the original Twitter\", it was a resting place for weary travellers seeking shade and the refreshment of a waterfall that once flowed, a forum for discussion and  to broadcast thoughts.Less than % of the area has been excavated, making it a living, breathing Indiana Jones adventure for archaeologists like Jerome Rohmer, who have been invited to conduct major digs.\"Ive worked in Syria and Jordan before, but this is completely fresh. Every time we find something, we see science moving forward.\"Jerome is one of several European talents employed in Saudis  mission, joining names like A-list chef Jason Atherton, who has opened Maraya Social in the Ashar Valley, km from Hegra.\"Ive been coming to the Middle East for  years and I didnt know natural beauty like this existed in this area,\" he says, when we meet at the restaurant which occupies the rooftop of the worlds largest mirrored building, reflecting a dramatic landscape of glowing red canyons.The glass conference hall is close to several of AlUlas new luxury hotels. Banyan Tree, Aman and Abercrombie  Kent all have projects in the pipeline, while experiential hotel group Habitas have already opened their -room property, spread across standalone villas.After dark, the fashionable propertys pool is lit up, while music pumps from speakers and canapes and cocktails are served on glitzy platters, making it feel more like a trendy St Tropez enclave than a hotel in a country governed by Islamic law. The missing ingredient is alcohol, although hoteliers are confident rules will be relaxed for foreign visitors in resorts.Change is, indeed, happening at a pace. By the end of , Philip Jones, chief destination marketing officer for the Royal Commission for AlUla, estimates there will be , hotel rooms available - although any development will be carefully controlled. This wont, he insists, be another Dubai.A project to plant . million palm trees is already underway, while oryx and gazelles have been rewilded in the Sharaan Nature Reserve, an area ear-marked for safari-style holidays. Its hoped an Arabian leopard reintroduction will follow.Its a carefully and expertly orchestrated plan. But one part of the process Saudi Arabia cant control is whether people will actually come.\"Our biggest challenge is the perception of Saudi Arabia, outside of its borders,\" admits Philip, acknowledging widespread international scepticism linked to reported human rights abuses. But he urges people to see beyond affairs of state. \"There are a lot of places in the world Ive visited that I dont necessarily embrace their politics. Besides, we have an opportunity and an obligation to help [Saudi Arabia] transition to become a more progressive country.\"One particularly controversial topic is the treatment of women.Mashail Makki, one of Saudi Arabias first female guides, shares her thoughts with me on a tour of the AlUla Old Town, where a citadel dating back to the th century has been restored as an open-air museum, and there are plans to reverse rural depopulation by enticing farmers back to the area.\"They say we dont have freedoms,\" she complains. \"But nobody ever asks us, so how would they know \" No-one forces her to wear a hijab, she insists. She simply enjoys the freedom of going out incognito.Admittedly, hers is only one voice, and while AlUla offers a fascinating window on ancient Arabia, getting a grip on the present is much harder.But does that really matter when there are so many treasures to unearth from the past Saudi is ready to share her secrets, andthe stars are aligning, its very tempting to join the caravan.How to plan your tripAbercrombie  Kentoffers seven nights on their Saudi Arabia: Desert Kingdoms Escorted Tour from £,pp .

Measures to control the spread of the virus will have widened health inequalities: those with high income, high security jobs have been able to protect themselves from the virus those with low income, low security jobs have not.“Moreover, there is evidence that the virus has made a heavier impact on people with obesity and among ethnic communities, both of whom are overrepresented in more deprived sectors.” and maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Gains in le expectancy for femalesand maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade\" class\"editor-image\"Gains in le expectancy for femalesand maleshave been stalling and even declining in the UK over the past decade Prof Kerr, who was born and educated in Maryhill and previously produced an NHS blueprint for the then-Scottish Executive in , said the “fundamental challenge” was to “reverse the longer trend towards a more unequal Britain”. This should include devoting more healthcare spending on prevention, he said, which is “signicantly underfunded”.Glasgow’s Maryhill and Springburn constituency - Scotland’s most deprived - could host a new research hub to pool expertise on tackling health inequalities from across the Marmot City network, which should include “all of our major cities”.Prof Kerr added that central governments at Westminster, Holyrood, Cardf, and Stormont must provide Marmot Cities with the “powers to act by devolving down control on health, employment services, housing, early years and education policies”.: Le expectancy widening between richest and poorest Labour MSP for Glasgow, Paul Sweeney, said: “ We cannot continue to see people pushed into poverty simply because of where they were born, and I would urge all governments across the UK to engage with these proposals seriously.”Scotlands Public Health Minister Maree Todd said: “It remains an unwelcome reality that communities experience health, quality of le and even le expectancy dferently across our society.“We already have in place a bold package of measures to improve population health which tackle issues such as smoking, obesity, inactivity and alcohol misuse – however, in order to fully address all aspects of inequality we need full control over economic, welfare and social policies, much of which is currently reserved to the UK Government.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is a long-term programme consisting of several inidual workstreams, of which the remote towers element is one.#The financial investment in the programme thus far provides a stable  to move forward with the essential modernisation of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands.#The investment is already benefiting the organisation and providing resilience through the recruitment of seven Ab-initio stafffor the modernisation programme and who are supporting operations for Sumburgh, Dundee, Wick and Kirkwall airports.#HIAL has also invested further in the training of our air traffic colleagues by purchasing an air traffic simulator and recruiting an in-house training team, who are currently located at New Century House.#HIAL add that they are #hopeful# of reaching an agreement with Prospect when the HIAL board meet this week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I have to be smart about it, I have to go about it the right way but hopefully I will be challenging for world titles sooner rather than later.“There is not many world and Olympic champions around. I don’t know the number of them in Britain. You have AJ, James DeGale, I know there is only a handful.“If I can add to it then it would be great for my legacy, great for my name and great for when I look back on my boxing le to say I was Olympic and world champion.”It has been a whirlwind few months for the one-time Land Rover employee, who achieved his dreams at the delayed  Games – and his success in Tokyo also earned him an MBE.A post shared by Galal Yafai Yafai jokes oldest brother Kal now has to call him by his title, but admitted: “I still can’t believe I’m an MBE. Do I look like an MBE  I don’t, do I  I look like a hoodlum.”While the tag may not yet sit comfortably with Matchroom’s newest recruit, he is more at home when in the ring and working hard, which he knows is a musthe is to transition from the amateur game where rounds are shorter and gloves are bigger.An O Arena debut next month will do little to dampen the fanfare but he is ready to handle the step up.“I can’t just win, I need to look good,” Yafai pointed out.“This is what I have wanted to do for so long. Yes, I know I am Olympic gold medallist and I have the tag of ‘golden boy’ but I don’t think I am the golden boy.“I just have the gold medal from the Olympics and I believe there are plenty of other great fighters from GB that are just as good as me ornot better than me so I don’t think I have got any pressure. I am excited and I just want to show everyone how good I am, so hopefully I can.”After disappointment at the  Rio Games, Yafai’s decision to wait what proved five years – due to the Covid- pandemic – to turn professional has paid idends and now he is positive about what the future holds after joining his brothers as part of the Matchroom and DAZN team.He added: “This is fun for me, it’s boxing. I love boxing.“I was boxing for my country in the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, travelling all around the world and now I get to box on the biggest stage as a professional and as Olympic champion on a great  like Matchroom and DAZN, so what is not to love “I was thinking I had done the wrong thing at the start of last year and telling myself ‘I made a mistake, I should have gone pro after  and taken a gamble’ but it paid off.“I put more pressure on myself to deliver at the Olympics. Thankfully I got the gold and now I am in the position I am in now. I’m ready to go.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We are not the ones who are going to stop our athletes expressing opinions.”Rule  of the Olympic Charter places restrictions on political protests at Games venues and sites.The rules were relaxed slightly ahead of the Tokyo Games to allow athletes to express their views on the field of play before competition, provided this was “not targeted, directly or indirectly, against people, countriesorganisations”.This allowed, for instance, the women’s football team to take the knee before matches. However, any protest deemed to be targeted at the Chinese government would still be prohibited in Olympic sites and venues.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

that#s why we believe that the checks continuing would be unlawful,” he added.That requires Edwin Poots as the minister to act in a way that will resolve that issue and Edwin Poots is going to act.So, the fact that it#s not on the agenda does not change the legal parameters by which Edwin Poots as a minister has to discharge his duties and he will be taking action.That is something that the DUP have said that we were going to do and we are going to do that.The First Minister also confirmed civil servants would be obliged to follow any instruction from Mr Poots regarding the halting of checks.It#s a ministerial instruction to the civil service, he said.It#s politicians who are elected, they have a democratic mandate, civil servants do not have a democratic mandate to take these decisions and, absolutely, civil servants will have to follow the democratic ministerial instruction of their minister.”It comes after Mr Givan had earlier suggested  February  would be a a signicant date for progress in negotiations with the EU over the Northern Ireland Protocol..He said there has to be progress on negotiations to remove the barriers to trade caused by the post-Brexit checks “imminently”.DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has previously warned he would potentially pull ministers out of Stormontprogress is not made.Mr Givan said: In that update Liz Truss has indicated that she is making progress with the European Union and obviously February  is a very signicant date in terms of what progress will have been made or not made.This the deadline that the UK Government are saying is a signicant date now because the Joint Working Committee is going to be meeting.I pressed the Foreign Secretary about the need to take action in the absence of there being progress and an agreed outcome with the European Union.The Foreign Secretary indicated that the UK Government does stand ready to take action, she mentioned the use of Article , but she prefers to get an agreed position with the European Union.I have emphasised the absolute critical nature of that progress being made, because the protocol is causing instability to these institutions, it is damaging our economy and this is having a real impact on Northern Ireland.So, we need to see that progress, we need to see that imminently and we also need to see action taken by the UK Governmentthere isn#t an agreed outcome.The protocol was negotiated to avoid a hard border with Ireland, by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU#s single market for goods.Unionists have consistently been pressuring for it to be scrapped because of the trade barriers it has created on products crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain.The First Minister’s party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson warned he could not guarantee Mr Givan would still be in position in the coming days with the DUP demanding changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol.Sir Jeffrey has repeatedly threatened to withdraw ministers from the powersharing Executive - a move that could collapse devolution -major changes to the Irish Sea border trading arrangements are not secured.Related topicsBrandon LewisPaul GivanMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenTop VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly -

We’ve also sold a few of the Pentire botanical non-alcoholic spirits.“One of the few shops we’ve launched in is Carnbrooke in Lisburn.“They took the whole range and said the Noughty Wine and cocktails went really well, so we have repeat business from that.”The company is now working in partnership with Pentire, which is buying all the Soho Houses across Europe in Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Rome.In the near future the Crawfords also have a second meeting with a top local resort, which is “really keen on the Noughty Wine as an alternative for guests who aren’t drinking”.NoLo covers any beverage with an alcohol content of under .%.Beers in the range include Clear Head and Hola with lime.Ms Crawford explained that as the company “was starting from a standing start” at the end of last year, they “didn’t expect anyone to find us”.“We were amazed to get  internet orders in just a month without any publicity,” she added.“We’ve just launched our social pages so we were pleased that people found us without us having or building any profile.“People are actively looking for alcohol-free drinks because there is a change in attitudes.“People are starting to become more health conscious and there are a lot of young people in Northern Ireland who aren’t drinking alcohol at all.”Her observations compound the results of a recent survey which found % of us were now teetotal — a trend pronounced in younger people.Alcohol Change UK also estimated around six out of  people are ‘sober curious’ and actively trying to cut back on the booze.One in sixadults who drinks alcohol is planning to have a month off drinking for January , or one in sevenof all UK adults. This is estimated at . million UK adults — up from an estimated . million last year, a % increase.Ms Crawford said golf clubs have also started stocking some of the alcohol-free range as a result of a change in culture.“People are popping in for a coffee and then driving home — they’re not going to the golf club and having  pints and staggering home,” she said.Cocktailsand sparkling winesare most popular locally because non-alcoholic spirits are expensive.“People can’t get their heads around paying £ for high-end alcohol-free spirit,” she pointed out.Sainsbury’s and Tesco, meanwhile, both report that sales of NoLo drinks have seen massive rises year-on-year.The proleration of ‘mindful drinking’ — a term that has come to the fore during the pandemic with people paying more attention to how much alcohol they consume — is one of the main reasons for the boosted sales.Although the traditional low alcohol wines, ciders and beers have all increased in popularity, the most signicant hike is in completely alcohol-free spirits.Tesco said sales of its NoLo spirits have soared by % since the start of , while Sainsbury’s has seen a % year-on-year increase.According to Alcohol Change UK, nearly halfof adults have tried NoLo drinks.The drinks business, meanwhile, has reported that this sector of the market will have grown by over a thirdby .Since the concept of ‘Dry January’ began in , with just , people taking part in the UK, that has increased to , who officially participated at the start of this year.Many have managed to steer clear of booze since, buying non-alcoholic drinks instead.A  study by University College London, which analysed thousands of - year-olds over the course of a decade, found that increasing numbers of young people did not drink alcohol at all, and reported signicant decreases in the number who drank above recommended limits or binged.Most ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenTop VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s a boy’: Belfast Zoo reveals new baby gorilla gender, with Northern Ireland public voting on nameDaisy Hill Hospital to lose emergency general surgery with services moving from Newry to CraigavonThe long haul...one year after Covid, mum is still strugglingHotelier hits out at lack of Stormont investment in all-Ireland tourism bodyDUP exposing itself to ‘public ridicule’ with port checks threat – O’NeillLatestShane Lowry and Rory McIlroy both left frustrated after opening round at Dubai Desert ClassicSue Gray report must be published immediately and in full, says SturgeonDemand from infrastructure is driving jobs in North Wales, says JohnsonParents of stab victim, five, pay tribute to ‘most beautul child in the world’National insurance rise ‘absolutely vital’, PM declares as Tory opposition grows,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The revival of student hotspots have been particularly welcomed, especially by Belfast’s dense university-attending population.Speaking just ahead of opening the doors last night, Jordan Heaney — bar supervisor at the Limelight — said he was excited for the club’s .Despite it being #dry January# he expected the Limelight to be as busy as ever due to its popularity with students and the fact that it has been closed for so long. Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It#s just about making sure there#s enough space now to fit everyone in, he joked. Dancing and indoor standing events in general are also now able to resume, and while Covid certication passports are no longer legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas, they are still needed to gain access to a club .While a lot of venues have opted to postpone their grand reopening until the weekend, restrictions officially eased for nightclubs as of noon yesterday, and many business owners throughout Northern Ireland were champing at the bit to get punters back through the doors as quickly as possible.In Belfast, Northern Ireland’s most popular LGBT+ venue, Kremlin kicked the night off at pm with resident DJ Ryan A, and the city centre’s Thompson’s Garage reopened at pm with their trademark hip hop and urban-themed Funkarama night.Outside Thompson’s, three friends — Adam, Caomhan, Ruairi— were more than ready to be back out #for good#. For Adam, it has been too long since he was in a nightclub with no restrictions. I was in Thompson#s two weeks ago, but it was table service and no dancing. I#d say last time I was in a full-on club was my secondyear, so two years ago.Despite clubs opening briefly back in October, the lads felt it #didn#t feel right to go but find that this time around, things seem more definitive.It felt like you were always waiting to go back into lockdown before, Adam added. But now it feels like you#re more allowed to go out.Caomhan said that the minute they heard last week that nightclubs would be reopening again, his instant reaction was: Right Wednesday night, let#s get out.Ruairi graduated from Queen#s University Belfast in December, but said he is planning to still make the most of his student party le now, adding: I missed my entire final year because of Covid.My entire final year, everything was closed. It was grim!Joe Dougan promotes clubs and events, including Shine Belfast, which owns the Limelight building. It is one of the city’s most renowned concert venues and had been restricted to comedy gigs and limited bar table service for long periods at a time during the pandemic. The nightclub itself has been closed for  weeks over the past two years, and only fully opened for eight, according to Mr Dougan.At pm last night though, it was clear to see how eager many of the Limelight’s lovers have been for theof its ‘UFO’ night. The ticketed event sold out well in advance of its re-launch.A regular midweek destination for students, UFO offers three rooms of tunes, two beer gardens and “insane production”.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” said Mr Dougan.He said he hopes that that an Executive meeting on February  will remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings, to bring nightclubs and other venues into line with the rest of hospitality. “But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel,” he added.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeQueen’s UniversityMore On The Executive OfficeHouseholders face a huge squeeze on energy budgets... and there may be no end in sightTribute: Stormont leaders issue message of tolerance for Holocaust Memorial Day PremiumTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at risk PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekPrison Service £m budget cut ‘unacceptable’Most ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenTop VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlayVideo - Prime Minister Boris Johnson remarks on Bloody SundayLatest Northern Ireland‘It’s a boy’: Belfast Zoo reveals new baby gorilla gender, with Northern Ireland public voting on nameDaisy Hill Hospital to lose emergency general surgery with services moving from Newry to CraigavonThe long haul...one year after Covid, mum is still strugglingHotelier hits out at lack of Stormont investment in all-Ireland tourism bodyDUP exposing itself to ‘public ridicule’ with port checks threat – O’NeillLatestSue Gray report must be published immediately and in full, says SturgeonDemand from infrastructure is driving jobs in North Wales, says JohnsonParents of stab victim, five, pay tribute to ‘most beautul child in the world’National insurance rise ‘absolutely vital’, PM declares as Tory opposition growsManchester United’s Amad Diallo set for loan spell with Rangers,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People around the world can see that we’re not prepared to give up. I know some of the families are getting older, and me myself, I could die, you know.“And I have a sister who’s passionate about this campaign and I would hope that she’d carry it on with good health.“That’s the one thing I do worry about, that I don’t make it to see prosecutions, because after that I wouldn’t care.“I just want equality for all those victims, and I mean all over Northern Ireland — equality and to be able to access the law, courts and have your case looked at independently.“Otherwise, the British Government should be taken to The Hague, because successive Governments have covered up those crimes.”The  Saville Report and apology by David Cameron exonerated the victims and vindicated the families’ campaign for justice.The victims, whose reputations were muddied by the Army, Government and sections of the press as “nail bombers and gunmen”, were cleared by the Prime Minister’s admission that the killings were “unjustied and unjustiable”.However, when the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign was launched, families had three clear demands: to have the Widgery Report whitewash overturned and replaced by an independent inquiry to gain a formal acknowledgement of the innocence of all their loved ones, and to prosecute those responsible.The third objective has not been met.Families want prosecutions, but there is a feeling among some that the Saville Inquiry apportioned blame to rogue rank-and-file soldiers while the reputation of military chiefs who directed operations on the day remained untarnished.At Prime Minister’s Questions at Westminster yesterday, Boris Johnson said: “This Sunday marks a tragic day in our history and is one of the darkest days of the Troubles.”He echoed comments made by Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to “learn from the past, reconcile and build a shared, peaceful and prosperous future”.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the Army and the Parachute Regiment to issue a formal apology in the House of Commons yesterday.While he was raising the matter, DUP MP Sammy Wilson could be heard interjecting saying “shame” and “they were protecting the people of Northern Ireland from republicans”.Mr Eastwood said Parachute Regiment flags were flown on the outskirts of Derry and the regiment had rightly condemned the flying of them as a “grossly offensive act”.But, he said, they have yet to apologise and condemn the actions of their soldiers on Bloody Sunday.Mr Lewis said the Government has to accept responsibility for what happened in the past and work to find a way forward.Related topicsColum EastwoodSDLPBrandon LewisBoris JohnsonMore On Colum EastwoodDUP facing ‘public ridicule’ over post-Brexit checks, claims Michelle O’Neill PremiumDonaldson criticised for warning that Givan could be pulled from First Minister role next weekBoris Johnson says Bloody Sunday ‘one of the darkest days’ ahead of Troubles anniversary PremiumSuzanne BreenOpinionStruggling DUP will have to claw its way back to topDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsMost ReadIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchBelfast family left ‘frightened and unsettled’ after sinister clown painting appears in back gardenTop VideosPlayBloody Sunday families reflect  years onPlayVideo: Billy Connolly -

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage.

In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in .

The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success.

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13211487.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some reviewers have claimed that Belfast lacks sufficient political context. The outbreak of violence in  is not properly explained in the film. Catholics and Protestants just seem to spontaneously start throwing things at each other. Surely Sir Kenny could have added a brief  to  minute prelude to the film outlining basic facts from Irish history starting with the Norman Invasion of . Or,he was pushed for time, maybe from the Plantation of Ulster in . He should at least have provided a comprehensive reading list with every cinema ticket sold. This would allow the film’s viewers across the globe to realise that the trouble in Belfast in  was actually caused by Oliver Cromwell, King Billy, the Pope, and Ian Paisley.Anyway, Kenny —you want to make Belfast , I am available.• My regular readers will be surprised to learn that it actually takes me quite a bit of time to write this column. It’s only around  words long but, dear reader, I can assure you that this is a hand crafted and bespoke newspaper column. Every single one of the words I compose is precious and sacred to me. Each comma and semi-colon is a friend. Every phrase is carefully considered, cogitated, and mulled over. I check and re-check the content. I always ask myself, is there a better way of expressing myself  Is a more pithy phrasing possible  Could the wording be wittier  Are my words open to misinterpretation  It’s only after being fully satisfied that I can stand over every syllable that I will let it be released to the public.If this was my policy, and indeed everyone’s policy when on Twitter, then the world would be a much better place.• Number  in lockdown was like the Holylands on St Patrick’s DayAt the time of writing the whole country is still locked in a bizarre updated version of Samuel Beckett’s classic play Waiting for Sue Gray .By the time you are reading this it will probably have been released so let me make an educated guess or two as to what Sue has found.Basically, during the strictest national lockdown in living memory, Number  was like a street in the Holylands on St Patrick’s Day. Sue will say that she changed her report from an investigation in to when parties took place at Downing Street to listing dates when they actually didn’t take place.There will be photographs of a COBRA meeting doing ‘Rock the Boat’.Sue will reveal that the cabinet were downing tequila shots to celebrate the arrival of Carrie Johnson’s new gold wallpaper.There will be video evidence of Boris holding an impromptu drinks party whilst on a visit to an ICU because it was Larry the Cat’s birthday. Sue will find that you can’t actually be ambushed by a cake.Sue will also allege that she was threatened by Tory Party whips and told thather report wasn’t favourable she’d be going back to running a pub in Newry. To be fair,we all just accept that Boris and his cabinet are permanently on the sauce it would actually help explain Brexit and a lot of other Tory Party policies. For instance, last week, in a desperate attempt to distract from Partygate ‘Culture Secretary’ Nadine Dorries attacked the BBC. I think she’s right. In fact all broadcasters should bow down to the Conservatives and only make television programmes that reflect true Tory Party values. Can I suggest a few suitable name changes of popular shows How about, Come Drink With Me  Strictly Come Boozing  The OneShow  Or a remake of the classic political sitcom Yesh Minishter  Anyway, it’s Wednesday morning and no-one can predict the immediate future. So I’m not saying that Boris is a dead man walking, but I wouldn’t be surprised , on Thursday, several Tory MPs dump him in a Post Office in Carlow.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs..removeShe is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers – despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniog’s  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church – which had a well named after Dwynwen – can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs..removeShe is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I have to be smart about it, I have to go about it the right way but hopefully I will be challenging for world titles sooner rather than later.“There is not many world and Olympic champions around. I don’t know the number of them in Britain. You have AJ, James DeGale, I know there is only a handful.“If I can add to it then it would be great for my legacy, great for my name and great for when I look back on my boxing le to say I was Olympic and world champion.”It has been a whirlwind few months for the one-time Land Rover employee, who achieved his dreams at the delayed  Games – and his success in Tokyo also earned him an MBE..removeYafai jokes oldest brother Kal now has to call him by his title, but admitted: “I still can’t believe I’m an MBE. Do I look like an MBE  I don’t, do I  I look like a hoodlum.”While the tag may not yet sit comfortably with Matchroom’s newest recruit, he is more at home when in the ring and working hard, which he knows is a musthe is to transition from the amateur game where rounds are shorter and gloves are bigger.An O Arena debut next month will do little to dampen the fanfare but he is ready to handle the step up.“I can’t just win, I need to look good,” Yafai pointed out.“This is what I have wanted to do for so long. Yes, I know I am Olympic gold medallist and I have the tag of ‘golden boy’ but I don’t think I am the golden boy.“I just have the gold medal from the Olympics and I believe there are plenty of other great fighters from GB that are just as good as me ornot better than me so I don’t think I have got any pressure. I am excited and I just want to show everyone how good I am, so hopefully I can.”After disappointment at the  Rio Games, Yafai’s decision to wait what proved five years – due to the Covid- pandemic – to turn professional has paid idends and now he is positive about what the future holds after joining his brothers as part of the Matchroom and DAZN team.He added: “This is fun for me, it’s boxing. I love boxing.“I was boxing for my country in the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, travelling all around the world and now I get to box on the biggest stage as a professional and as Olympic champion on a great  like Matchroom and DAZN, so what is not to love “I was thinking I had done the wrong thing at the start of last year and telling myself ‘I made a mistake, I should have gone pro after  and taken a gamble’ but it paid off.“I put more pressure on myself to deliver at the Olympics.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe UK chief executive of the human rights organisation, Sacha Deshmukh, has written to his counterpart at the British Olympic Association, Andy Anson, urging the BOA to avoid placing restrictions on athletes.Amnesty said campaign messages, such as the ‘Where is Peng Shuai ’ T-shirts and banners which were initially banned by organisers of the Australian Open tennis tournament, must be supported by the BOA.The letter provided Anson with an update on the “intensying” suppression of human rights in China, citing the persecution of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province, the crackdown on democratic protests in Hong Kong and continuing concerns over tennis star Peng Shuai’s freedom and well-being.The International Olympic Committee said on Wednesday that its representatives had spoken to Peng last week and were planning to meet her in Beijing next week, but has faced criticism over its handling of her situation.Deshmukh said: “The British Olympic Association mustn’t repeat the Australian Open’s disastrous T-shirt ban and should instead support Team GB athletes wanting to speak about human rights in China.“From the industrial-scale detention and torture of Uyghur people in Xinjiang, to the jailing of protesters in Hong Kong – these Games are taking place in the shadow of China’s horric human rights abuses.  .\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eceffdafcfccabYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQzMzYMTU ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eceffdafcfccabYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQzMzYMTU ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production eceffdafcfccabYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjQzMzYMTU ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"There are fears that Peng Shuai’s freedom is being suppressed by the Chinese authorities “If the British Olympic Association resorts to muzzling athletes it will be complicit in China’s sportswashing attempts and complicit in its massive programme of systematic human rights abuse.“These Games should not become a rights-free zone – freedom of speech and the right to openly debate and discuss human rights should be an integral part of these Games.”.removeAnson spoke about athletes’ rights to express themselves earlier this month, prior to receiving the letter from Amnesty.He said: “We definitely want our athletes to be respectful of the athletes they are standing on the podium with,we are not going to stle their freedom of expression. vw,vw,px, px\"Chinese President Xi Jinping is accused of overseeing an intensied suppression of human rights in the country “We’ve told the athletes all along that we’re very happy for them to express themselves but to be sensible and to ideally touch base with usthey feel that they’re doing anything at all controversial. We are not the ones who are going to stop our athletes expressing opinions.”Rule  of the Olympic Charter places restrictions on political protests at Games venues and sites.The rules were relaxed slightly ahead of the Tokyo Games to allow athletes to express their views on the field of play before competition, provided this was “not targeted, directly or indirectly, against people, countriesorganisations”.This allowed, for instance, the women’s football team to take the knee before matches.
