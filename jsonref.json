Everyone knew he messaged his \u0027favourite\u0027 girls. But it was dismissed as \u0027just Mr Belfield\u0027 and we were told to ignore it. He has so much power, nobody wanted to rock the boat.\u0027People were scared of losing their place at the school.\u0027I\u0027ve had nightmares about Mr Belfield and my mental health has got worse since I left school in May. He has messed with my head so much. Even if what he has done doesn\u0027t meet the criminal threshold, it is a massive breach of trust. I feel so let down by the council of manage-ment, everyone at the school.On one occasion, Belfield told Cat she would make \u0027a terrible girlfriend\u0027 because she is \u0027far too demanding\u0027 and that she should wait until she was 28 to get a boyfriend. He also wrote about being lonely on his trips abroad.\u0027There are so many beautiful girls here but I\u0027m faithful to my wife as I don\u0027t believe in unfaithful behaviour and I know you approve!!!,\u0027 he wrote while staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow. He went on to say that when Cat got married: \u0027I will be at the wedding. You will make a lovely bride. I will be sooooo proud. It will all happen for you,\u0027 he wrote in another. \u0027I know you believe and trust me. I\u0027ll be checking you\u0027re OK throughout this holiday.

None of them are cute but every parent thinks their own one is. I favour sterilisation.\u0027He added: \u0027Any woman that has a baby and cannot properly look after it should be deported to another country and should be forcibly sterilised so they can\u0027t have any more.\u0027Cat says that when she finally told a teacher about his messages, she was told: \u0027It\u0027s just Mr Belfield being Mr Belfield.\u0027 Another told her to block him on social media.She says that when she deactivated her Instagram account, Belfield sent the school nurse to tell her he needed to be able to have contact with her. I said that he could email me but the nurse came back and said it has to be WhatsApp so he can call you or Instagram.\u0027I didn\u0027t want to give him my number so I reactivated my Instagram account.\u0027Belfield grew up in Cornwall before graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge, with a maths degree in 1994. He began teaching a year later at independent Concord College in Shrewsbury. It was there he met his wife Barbara. They married in 2001. He became head of sixth form at Ruthin School in 2001. He was made principal in 2010.When Cat finally left the school in May last year, Belfield was temporarily suspended while investigations were undertaken but returned to work in September. He hasn\u0027t been seen at the school since November last year, when the school was inspected twice by the Care Inspectorate Wales and Estyn, the Welsh Ofsted.Cat\u0027s mother Susan, a former teacher, says that after seeing the messages which had been sent to her daughter \u0027I called social services, the Care Inspectorate Wales, the Charity Commission, the Education Workforce Council and Estyn, everyone I could think of to ask why he hadn\u0027t been sacked.\u0027Social services explained that because he worked in an independent school the governors had to make that call and their hands were tied.\u0027She says she subsequently contacted the chair of the school\u0027s Council of Management, Julie Oldbury, and asked her \u0027How would you feel if it was your daughter?\u0027\u0027But all she kept saying was \u0027no comment.\u0027 \u0027The school source who spoke to the Mail said that, thanks to Belfield\u0027s success at the school, he had become virtually untouchable — and that he was \u0027a dictator who wouldn\u0027t be challenged\u0027.The source spoke of the \u0027complete control\u0027 Belfield exerted over the school, particularly given his combined roles as both head and bursar.\u0027Because he manages the money as well, he has control over everything,\u0027 says the source. \u0027He is like a kingpin between the Council of Management and the rest of the school and it was just him in the middle speaking for both sides. He has made himself indispensable.\u0027The inspection report by Care Inspectorate Wales last week concluded the school was being run by an \u0027autocratic and controlling management\u0027.This week, Estyn also published a report of their findings after their \u0027unannounced focused visit\u0027 in November, saying the role of the principal \u0027is not defined precisely so it is not clear to what extent the principal is exempt from specific guidelines and why this should be the case, how the principal is held to account and consequently what the principal can and cannot do\u0027.The Council of Management welcomed the publication of the reports and said in a statement that it \u0027has been working tirelessly to ensure both reports\u0027 recommendations are implemented and has been carrying out a root-and-branch strategic review of its safeguarding governance and safeguarding arrangements, and that is continuing.\u0027The school is determined to ensure all appropriate steps are taken. In response to the Estyn report, the Council of Management produced a comprehensive action plan to address the shortcomings identified, and other areas of improvement. This was submitted to the Welsh government on January 17 for approval.\u0027Belfield appears to have relished the control he has exercised at the school. \u0027I have complete authority,\u0027 he wrote in one of his messages to Cat. \u0027I can do whatever I like. I can go to any country I feel like. I\u0027m creating a new school piece by piece. By the time I retire I will have created something forever — and I will be remembered for many years!!!\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Got Brexit UK finally leaves EU Britons country celebrate","story":"Share this article              Mr Johnson signed the ratified Withdrawal Agreement last week in another highly symbolic step towards BrexitJanuary 24: Mr Johnson signs the ratified Withdrawal Agreement in another highly symbolic step. January 29: MEPs approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 621 to 49.

Thousands of miles away in Central America, KMS earned more dirty money, this time from the American government. It was 1984, the height of the Cold War, and the Reagan administration was obsessed with removing Nicaragua’s Marxist Sandinista government. The former US President is pictured aboveLandon, whose son Arthur is a socialite and friend of Princes William and Harry, was on close terms with Thatcher, which may have dissuaded concerned mandarins in Whitehall — the previous Labour government had considered banning all mercenary companies — from kicking up a fuss.KMS also had a friend in Lord Royle, the Tory vice-chairman in the Eighties, who acted as its informal link with the Foreign Office. But for all its links to people in high places, not every KMS trooper was comfortable with its blatant disregard for military ethics.One KMS contractor who couldn’t turn a blind eye to the mercenary group’s atrocities was former SAS trooper Robin Horsfall, a veteran of the Iranian embassy siege operation in London in 1980.He accepted a KMS job in Sri Lanka in 1986 aged 27 after working as a bodyguard for Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed.Imagining KMS to be a responsible organisation, he hoped it would be different to the ‘Dogs Of War’-style mercenary outfits that had rampaged through Angola and the Congo in the Sixties and Seventies.But after just four months as a battle school commander in Sri Lanka, he quit, appalled at the ethnic slaughter taking place around him. The tipping point came when a South African helicopter pilot described to him how his Sri Lankan door gunner had on one occasion mown down every living creature in sight.However, when asked by the Mail about what he witnessed, Mr Horsfall insisted that he does not believe former British military personnel were directly involved in war crimes — as they themselves didn’t fire weapons at civilians.‘I have no knowledge of that and never heard of anything like it —and I’m sure I would have heard,’ he says. ‘But there is no doubt that the Sinhalese commanders perpetrated genocide against the Tamils.’By 1985, KMS’s name curiously disappeared from government documents, but its subsidiary company, Saladin Security — founded in 1978 by Walker — lives on, and to this day has strong links with Saudi Arabia’s despotic regime.And what of those who made money from their involvement in these secretive wars?Major Baty lives in retirement in England. When visited by Miller and asked about his role in the dirty war in Sri Lanka, his reply was short and to the point: ‘Bugger off!’As for Walker, he re-invented himself as, of all things, a local Tory councillor on Elmbridge Council in Surrey for a time.Before his election, he reportedly told voters that he was ‘a man of action’ and involved in ‘defence matters at a national level’.In 2017, on learning of a ceremony commemorating the STF, he penned a letter to its then commandant, praising its founders.Describing Keenie Meenie’s role in Sri Lanka from 1983, he wrote: ‘It continues to be a matter of great pride that I frequently heard STF described as the most effective force in the country.’‘Effective’ is one way to describe it.

However, the fashion industry is trailing behind supermarkets, where one in five of all new products launched last year were vegan.The new guidelines for producing vegan fashion have been drawn up by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for stores and online sellers, after it was inundated with requests from fashion buyers trying to source vegan products for the first time.The process is more complex than just eliminating popular materials such as leather, suede and wool. Businesses must examine every material used in a product, including the ingredients of the glues, dyes and waxes used.The BRC warns retailers they should should not claim a product is sustainable simply because it is vegan – a definition that means only the product contains no animal-derived materials or ingredients.Vegan-labelled items should also be providing an alternative to something that is traditionally made with animal products.The ethical retail market, which s everything from food and drink to cosmetics, was worth more than £40bn by the end of 2018. That compares to about £11bn 20 years ago, according to an annual study by the Co-op.While eating ethically – a banner that covers Fairtrade, organic, vegetarian and plant-based alternatives – has taken off, the clothing market has been a laggard. Ethical fashion spending is only £50m, which is a fraction of the £35bn fashion market (although sales of vintage and secondhand clothing have rocketed).\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.The Mintel study found that more than a third of fashion shoppers would like to spend their money in stores that did not use animal products. This trend has not gone unnoticed by retailers battling for sales: half of Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s shoes are now vegan and three of its top 10 bestselling bags this winter were also vegan.Chana Baram, a retail analyst at Mintel, said: “It’s no longer enough for clothing to be priced well or to reference the latest trends. Many young people today are likely to be influenced by the ‘Attenborough’ or ‘Greta’ effects and are becoming far more aware of the negative effects of fast fashion.”The Scottish tights brand Snag, which only launched 20 months ago, is on track to hit sales of £20m this year. Its founder, Brie Read, says its tights, which are vegan and come in rainbow colours, have struck a chord with women frustrated by ill-fitting, conservative hosiery.Read says it was an active choice to ensure its products were vegan – some fashion is by accident rather than design. “For us, it was dyes,” she explained. “A lot of them are not vegan friendly because they are made out of crushed beetles. We have to be careful about the dyeing process and getting really good cotton.”Snag’s business model involves interacting every day with potential shoppers on social media. “We’re very much based around our customers and lots of them are vegan and concerned about ethics,” Read said. “They ask us every single day: ‘Are your tights vegan?’”Mintel found that shoppers were confused by conflicting messages regarding what is, and is not, sustainable, and that the fashion business needed to develop industry-wide best practice guidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe1bf3b05ad0531a0561de527e64efb31e5b7cb6/0_41_1562_937/master/1562.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e379a35fd65b56563b4c1222b29f8f01","title":"britain eu economic political maastricht","story":"In 20 years’ time it will be seen as more remarkable that we joined the Common Market in 1973 than that we voted to leave the European Union in 2016. If ever there was a mismatch of intentions, needs and aspirations, it was our 47-year membership. To paraphrase Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady, both sides kept asking: “Why can’t they be more like me?”This game of push-me-pull-you worked well for the first 25 years, but once the single currency was created the tensions ultimately became unmanageable. The Maastricht opt-outs on the euro and the common travel area were crucial. They declared that it was no longer a “two-speed Europe”, a union with a common destination, where it would merely take some countries a bit longer to get there than others. Instead it was a Europe where some countries just had a different understanding of democracy and how they wished to be governed.The aim of the postwar settlement was to keep communism out and contain Germany while enabling it to be economically successful. Two models emerged for the way European nation states might relate to each other, given that aim. One was based entirely on trade – the European Free Trade Association (Efta) the other used trade as a means to achieve political integration – the Common Market. Once the UK had left Efta and joined the Common Market in 1973, Efta was diminished and no longer offered an effective alternative.After that, the UK’s approach to the EU depended on context. Our two biggest political parties have at times swung from being all for it to outright hostile. Margaret Thatcher embraced the creation of the single market without fully appreciating that for some it wasn’t so much about trade but about providing the foundations for a single currency. The Labour party under Neil Kinnock embraced the EU when the Jacques Delors commission delivered the social policies the Thatcher government opposed.Tony Blair proved a full-fledged devotee. For him the rationale was geopolitical and strategic. The EU provided the UK with an opportunity to shape the world’s future. During his first term of office he vigorously made the case for the EU, created cross-cutting ministerial bodies, encouraged working with sister parties and even told ministers to go and learn foreign languages.The invasion of Iraq changed all that. The UK sided with the US, and Blair never recovered. In 2005 the British people were promised a referendum on the European constitution, although the three main parties found reasons to ditch that promise after the election.When he became prime minister, David Cameron set out not to “bang on about Europe”. Parliament no longer debated ahead of European council meetings, and the annual discussions about fisheries or agriculture disappeared too.When the in-out referendum was announced, I asked myself what it would take for me to vote remain. If the EU had acknowledged that the institutional architecture should have changed to accommodate euro countries, which required deeper political integration, and non-euro countries, which needed a looser framework, I would have said: “OK, let’s give it a try.” Not a case of British opt-outs, but an EU that recognises two kinds of membership: a core and a periphery.Britain originally joined a political project for economic reasons, and the remain campaign made the case for continued membership on economic grounds. But for once, it wasn’t the economy, stupid. People voted to leave for reasons of community, identity and belonging. Our organic constitution has at its roots the principle that we vote for iniduals who represent particular policies, and they operate within a set of rules that can be changed by the people via elections. These deep emotions are more powerful than money. It is wrong to ignore them, and even worse to sneer and belittle them.Compared with the bloody battles of other periods in our history, the significant upheavals of the last few years have been remarkably peaceful. One referendum, two general elections and three prime ministers later, the British people affirmed that they still meant what they said in 2016. There have been no profound ruptures in our democratic structures, and the party political system has shown remarkable resilience.As we are leaving, the EU, like us, will have to make changes to the way it works. That’s all to the good. Whatever the future holds, however, we must all remain friends, as well as Europeans.• Gisela Stuart was the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston from 1997 to 2017 and chair of Vote Leave"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecab55dc4d1597f5739271a34cf1789f22e441d/0_63_5350_3210/master/5350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f3208b38676617399ab7aa97bdb1e6","title":"ireland uk brexit peace good friday agreement","story":"Today marks an end and a beginning. Forty-seven years after both Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community, the latter has chosen to leave and to take a new path. It is a sombre day for some in the UK and a positive one for others. Whatever your perspective, it’s clear that the decision to leave the EU will bring change. In Ireland, we will always regret that our closest neighbour and partner will no longer sit with us and the other member states around the EU table in Brussels.We still don’t have the full picture of the final terms of the UK’s future relationship with the EU, but we know it will not be the same. What’s clear to me, as it has been to successive Irish governments, is that Ireland’s bilateral relationship with the UK is, and will remain, of vital importance. It is based on deep ties of friendship and family, our common European heritage and values – ties that are deeply cherished.Our two nations are so deeply intertwined as a result of generations of personal contacts and interaction. Some 700,000 people from the island of Ireland live in towns and cities the length and breadth of Great Britain. Several millions more are Irish citizens by descent. Tens of thousands travel back and forth between the UK and Ireland every single week, and the London-Dublin air corridor is the busiest in Europe, the second busiest in the world. The common travel area, which has long enabled profound connection between our countries, was last year protected through a memorandum of understanding between both governments. British and Irish citizens will continue to move freely to live, to study, to work in any corner of these islands. British citizens resident in Ireland will be free to vote in our upcoming general election – a reciprocal privilege afforded to Irish citizens in the UK.These deep networks and this freedom of movement drive an economic and trading relationship between Ireland and the UK worth £1.1bn per week. Our desire to continue to foster such close ties will not change, although the level and intensity of this bilateral relationship will inevitably be shaped by future EU-UK arrangements. The closer the relationship between the EU and UK, the easier it will be to keep our two countries close.An approach based on partnership was central to the restoration of the power-sharing executive and assembly in Northern Ireland last month. That kind of cooperation, enshrined at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, has developed gradually, over decades, and it was underpinned by our common EU membership. But even as the UK leaves the EU, protection of the Good Friday agreement remains a shared priority for both our governments, as was acknowledged in the withdrawal agreement.As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement, as a jurisdiction sharing the island of Ireland and as an EU member state, Ireland will play its part to ensure that the withdrawal agreement will work for the people of Ireland, north and south, for the UK and for the EU.Preparations are of course now under way for the next phase of negotiations: the future relationship. Ireland will continue to pursue its interests vigorously in this phase. At the same time, we will advocate for an ambitious deal that works to the benefit of all. And while we will miss the UK, it will continue to be an important and natural partner for the EU. We will find ways to work together to advance our shared ideals on the global stage. The joint political declaration underlines our common determination to protect the rules-based international order, the rule of law and democracy, high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, and consumer and environmental protection, and to cooperate against internal and external threats to our values and interests.While today will undoubtedly usher in change, some things will remain constant. The geography of these islands, our extraordinary people-to-people interaction, and our trade – these will all endure. The UK and Irish governments will remain steadfast partners in supporting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Our nations’ relationship is a vital one, of rare complexity and intensity. No matter what challenges lie ahead, Ireland is committed to firm friendship with the UK – our neighbour and partner in the peace process – both now and in the years to come.• Simon Coveney is Ireland’s tánaiste (deputy prime minister), and foreign affairs minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eff27f1c4e4ff8336e9f85afe4fc9c30e7a621b/0_48_4377_2626/master/4377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8afbfb8dc376ebe1c3fab57177644e47","title":"sajid javid adapt quickly","story":"There’s a sense Javid is in the role because he is compliant. But even that hasn’t been enough to win over everyone inside No 10There’s a sign in the Treasury building that reads: “Strong economy”. The placard made its way to the government building from one of the 2019 election rallies. While the economy may not have been front and centre of the Conservative campaign – “Get Brexit done” was the star of the show – it is there to serve as a reminder that strong economics must underline any well-functioning Tory government.The relationship between a prime minister and chancellor has the potential to define a premiership – Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s tempestuous relationship eventually consumed them both, while David Cameron and George Osborne were striking for how their loyalty endured even in testing moments. Johnson and Javid’s relationship is rarely written up as a spar between heavyweights or a great meeting of minds. There’s a sense that Javid is in the role because he will be compliant. Even that perceived quality hasn’t been enough to win him favour with everyone inside No 10.Since being appointed chancellor, Javid has seen an aide sacked without his permission by Johnson’s senior aide, Dominic Cummings he has been besieged by reports that the former Vote Leave campaign director is calling the shots rather than him and has developed the Whitehall nickname Chino – chancellor in name only.Prior to the election, No 10 staff made little secret of the fact they found his deputy, Rishi Sunak, easier to deal with – some complained Javid had succumbed to Treasury groupthink – that he had conformed to a civil service way of assessing cost and risk that would restrict the government’s radicalism. They thought he was difficult, and reluctant to relax the purse strings on key policy areas. Before the election, the doubts surrounding his future were so great that Johnson chose to make a public statement during the campaign that he would not replace the chancellor.But just because Javid’s short-term future is secure in next month’s reshuffle doesn’t mean he’s now popular in No 10. In fact, evidence this week suggests the contrary. Reports emerged of tensions between No 10 and No 11 over a briefing to Thursday’s papers. Multiple front pages zeroed in on the news that Javid was planning to back HS2 ahead of a crunch meeting between him, Johnson and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps. This was written up as Javid leading the way and pushing Johnson towards backing a project his close aide Cummings had previously warned against.The problems were twofold: first, No 10 didn’t want this to be leading the news agenda – it had a planned announcement of extra funding for schools. No official decision is to be announced on high-speed rail for several weeks. Second, all the signs have suggested that Johnson is leaning towards giving the costly infrastructure project the green light. Critics think Javid had sensed which way the wind was blowing and got in there early to try to get some of the credit.Figures in Downing Street could barely hide their annoyance – with an official suggesting this was behaviour worthy of Theresa May’s chaotic minority government rather than Johnson’s 80-majority team.The incident is revealing of Javid’s new approach to his role. The priority is to befriend Johnson rather than worry about his sceptical aides. While Javid is known to clash with Cummings, he has gone to great lengths to ensure he is on good terms with the prime minister.Whether it’s bonding over their dogs or getting a report to Johnson just before he flew to the Caribbean on how to make the prime minister’s “level-up” agenda – to create economic opportunities in the Midlands and north that match those in the south – a reality, Javid has developed a strong personal relationship. “He’s more popular with the residents in the No 10 apartment than the No 10 office,” says an insider. It’s worth remembering that Carrie Symonds, Johnson’s partner, worked with Javid when she was a Tory aide, and that he was a guest at her 30th birthday party.The budget is an example of this. Javid has agreed to meet with the prime minister at the beginning of each week to work on the budget – this is a closer No 10-No 11 relationship than in previous regimes. Javid’s answer to the scepticism around him is to show that he can deliver what Johnson wants. That want is a new approach. No 10 doesn’t just believe that higher spend is necessary – there’s also a sense that the Tory ideal of Thatcherism is of the past and another way forward has to be found to keep the party’s new voters on side. Lowering taxes and rolling back state interference in the economy may still be heralded as an aspiration by ministers speaking at thinktank drinks receptions, but few Conservative MPs actually expect such measures to be a hallmark of this government. It’s more likely the state will increase in size.Given Javid named Thatcher as the figure who inspired him as a teenager to achieve his dream, he is having to adapt fast. In the build-up to the budget, the Treasury is looking at revenue-raising measures that will allow Javid to stick to his rules and deliver Johnson’s agenda. The first year of a government is seen as the best time to bring in measures that will not be universally popular. If they can bring in extra revenue, it will give the chancellor more flexibility on day-to-day spending.So far Javid has shown he is willing. When reports emerged that there could be a new rival powerbase to the Treasury, he and his team worked to suggest that was not needed. The plans are believed to have been put on ice. But the one thing that will really decide the longevity of Javid’s tenure in No 11 relates to Brexit. Johnson and his team saw firsthand, with Philip Hammond under Theresa May, how a chancellor can undermine and undercut their prime minister if they are set on different paths. Hammond’s seeming reluctance to release no-deal planning money was viewed by Johnson aides today as deeply damaging. Javid has said publicly that he supports Johnson’s plans for Brexit ergence and a Canada-style model. That model will bring challenges. So long as Javid is working with them on this, he has a strong chance of staying put for the forseeable future.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acb92a030b45b7879c4110cb3638954947c89514/0_292_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a172ed9c2c43095ec97a022f08ed1e5c","title":"wuhan city coronavirus china","story":"Coronavirus is a test of the Chinese government. But people in a quarantined city don’t care about political point-scoringOn 17 January, I met a friend at the Hankou train station in Wuhan, 17 days after the first cases of coronavirus had been reported. She was the only person wearing a face mask. At the time, the official line was that everything was under control and the spread of the virus would be prevented. “The Huanan seafood market is only two blocks away,” I teased, a reference to the epicentre of the outbreak. In an all-night restaurant, the glass tanks were swimming with life. We ate noodles with crab legs. The streets were packed, drunk revellers hailing cabs after their end-of-year company parties. A man doubled over to vomit and a young woman patted him on the back: “Ready for another round?”A week ago, the panic was still confined to health-conscious retirees, always prone to worrying about seasonal illnesses. News of a virus just gave older people another reason to instruct the young: don’t go out, drink plenty of water. There were also the conspiracy theorists who doubted official news but couldn’t provide more reliable information. To most of us, not wearing a mask seemed reasonable and logical. Who wanted to be associated with paranoid pensioners or ill-informed cranks?Wuhan is not a city of fear. I can’t think of a time when my hometown has ever been gripped by panic. Perhaps this has something to do with its revolutionary past – the city is the site of the Wuchang uprising in 1911 that overthrew the Qing dynasty. If a revolution didn’t faze us, a virus won’t either.In 1998, when I was a child growing up in Wuhan, a flood burst the dams on the Yangtze River. Neighbourhoods were head-deep in water and public transport came to a standstill. The ground levels of houses and apartment blocks were submerged, so kids would play together on the second floors of buildings, firing BB guns at dead animals floating in the water. While we had a watery vacation, our parents kept going to work. Wuhan residents have a perversely resilient streak: the more extreme a challenge, the more we rise to it.When the time came for my friend to leave on 19 January, official reports from other provinces informed us the virus wasn’t confined to Wuhan and that it could be transmitted between human carriers. Though supermarkets were still crowded with local people stocking up for the lunar new year celebrations, the atmosphere had become more tense. I was only back in town for the holidays, and wrote to my university in Australia about extending my leave.The following day, I came down with cold-like symptoms. At the local community clinic, the doctor, the only person wearing a face mask, prescribed antibiotics, drugs to fight fever and traditional honeysuckle medicine. I didn’t have a fever, so he wrote down my name and age, before informing a crowd of patients that the clinic had run out of face masks. Go take a look in the pharmacy next door, he suggested. “What can we do to prevent getting sick,” someone asked. The doctor lowered his mask and replied: “Try positive thinking.” Everyone laughed.The shelves in the pharmacy stocked all types of face masks. I hesitated before selecting a handful at random. Another customer arrived shortly afterwards with a bulky bag to buy the rest of the stock. In Shanghai and Beijing, masks were already selling out – in Wuhan, they’re now almost impossible to find. As new year approached, they became ubiquitous, like pear blossoms budding out of season.A lot of people were coming down with colds – some real, some imaginary. I was due to meet friends for lunch in the city centre. Come over and drink down the virus, they said. None of us suggested cancelling. The restaurants were emptier than usual, and by the time we had finished drinking we were the only people left. Outside, as we walked across Liberation Park, we took off our masks. I’d never seen the park so quiet. “It’s because it’s raining today,” my friend said, flipping up his collar.At 2am on 23 January, Wuhan’s residents learned that in eight hours’ time, buses, trains, flights and ferries would be suspended to and from the city. The airport, the train station and the metro were closed. The World Health Organization called the quarantine “unprecedented in public health history”. Concerned messages flooded my phone. I tossed a few effervescent vitamin tablets into a glass of water. My parents went shopping to stock up goods were grabbed as soon as they made it on to the supermarket shelves. The supermarket closed in the morning, to reopen at an undetermined date. At the door a security guard touched everyone’s head with a thermometer, as if giving them a blessing.It’s a fortnight since I met my friend at the Hankou station. The Huanan seafood market shut on 21 January. My neighbourhood is nearly deserted, and I’m sleeping unusually well. The news is dominated by a combination of new year celebrations and selfless doctors and nurses venerated by Chinese media as frontline heroes. On social media the crisis has become a litmus test for the flaws and merits of the Chinese government. Neither side has changed position, but now they have new examples to invoke, new justifications for praising or criticising the state. I didn’t want to write a word Wuhan wasn’t an argument for me to brandish in a debate.People in a quarantined city don’t care about political point-scoring.• Xiaoyu Lu is a research student, a travel writer and a frequent contributor to Chinese media• This article was translated by Allen Young.

Trump has frequently cited article two of the constitution as justification to do, well, anything, though “I doubt Trump has ever read even one full sentence of the constitution”, said Meyers. “He probably got three words in and quit – ‘We the people? I think that M is upside down.’”“Trump’s claim that he can do whatever he wants is very much at the core of Trumpism and the modern Republican party, and that ethos is very much on display in this impeachment trial,” said Meyers. “Republicans have spent a decade pretending to be a principled party based on limited government and respect for the constitution, when in reality, they never cared about any of that stuff. Today’s Republican party is an authoritarian movement led by people who believe they should have the power to impose their will on everyone else.”Trump “perfectly embodies that authoritarian mindset”, said Meyers, as displayed in shocking form on Wednesday when his lawyer Alan Dershowitz argued to senators that a quid pro quo arrangement to influence the 2020 election would not be illegal because Trump was trying to get himself re-elected, which is in the national interest.Meyers called that logic an “absolutely insane argument that is antithetical to literally everything the founders believed when they wrote the constitution”. In practice, Meyers continued, Dershowitz argued that “if you believe you being president is what’s best for the country, then you’re allowed to do whatever you want in order to remain president. That’s insane.”“By that logic, Trump could shut down airports under the pretense of high winds any time one of his Democratic challengers had a flight,” he said, “which would affect everyone but Bernie, who likely has a backup mule.”“The Senate impeachment trial is racing democracy to see which one can end faster,” said Stephen Colbert on perhaps the last Late Show episode before the trial ends, pending a vote on whether to admit new evidence or witnesses.In closing arguments on Thursday, the California congressman Adam Schiff argued for the prosecution that senators acknowledge the absurdity of not allowing witnesses, while Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow made an eerie plea to the American people to “join us, join us, one nation, one people”.“There’s nothing unsettling about that,” Colbert deadpanned. “Join us, join us. Resistance is futile. Kneel before Trump and be absorbed by his Maga for there is joy and peace nestled within his sweaty folds. Join us – join the hive mind.”Colbert also returned to Dershowitz’s argument from Wednesday that Trump could do no wrong if he acted to ensure his re-election, which was in the national interest. “Now, if this rationale alarms you, then you’re in good company,” said Colbert, as the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, compared the logic to the absolute monarchism of Louis XIV. “When you think about it – and I recommend you don’t – Trump has a lot in common with Louis XIV: same decorating style, same lax attitude toward extramarital affairs, they both poop in a drawer,” Colbert said. “Plus, Louis was the sun king and Trump is the stare-directly-at-the-sun king. The only difference is Trump’s motto: let ME eat cake.”If Senate Republicans have their way, the impeachment trial will be over by the end of this week, said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night. “Captain Cover-up Mitch McConnell is hoping to have it all wrapped up by tomorrow.”Kimmel, too, remained baffled by the argument put forth by Dershowitz that “Trump could just do whatever he wants by just saying that his re-election is in our best interest. By that logic, he could start eating bald eagles for breakfast and he’d say: ‘I have to, I need my strength for the campaign trail,’” said Kimmel.McConnell has argued that if the Senate opens the trial up to witnesses, as House Democrats have urged, it could go on for months and prevent the Senate from getting business done, “as if they’ve done any business”, Kimmel said. “Blockbuster video has done more business than the Senate in the last three years.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah recapped some of the world’s non-impeachment news, such as Mike Pence’s visit with Pope Francis. “Yes, that’s right, the most religious man in the world met the pope,” Noah said. “I bet after meeting Mike Pence, the pope walked away being like: ‘That guy’s a Jesus freak.’”Noah had one burning question: “Do you think the pope took Pence’s confession? Because if he did, that would have to be the most boring confession the pope has ever heard. The pope would probably be like: ‘You walked in on your wife taking off her shoes? I don’t care. No, eating salty food is not a sin.’”Meanwhile, the deadly coronavirus continues to spread in China, and the government has responded with a plan to build a thousand-bed hospital in 10 days. “There is no other country that can do anything that fast,” Noah said. “Like in America, it takes longer than that to get cable installed. I’ve learned when you order cable in this country, you aren’t ordering it for you – you’re ordering it for your grandkids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35cc262888549a150d30de1502a78d0e8fa85b9e/656_362_4718_2831/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69e261439da6d0684268d3b9825f55ce","title":"cropped out climate activist vanessa nakate urges media to hear africans","story":"Ugandan activist says she hopes storm over Davos photo will help shift narrativeThe Ugandan climate activist who was cropped out of a press photo in Davos has said many African activists experience the same erasure but feel unable to speak up.The Associated Press apologised last week after it cropped Vanessa Nakate out of a photo she had posed for alongside fellow activists Greta Thunberg, Loukina Tille, Luisa Neubauer and Isabelle Axelsson.At a Fridays For Future press conference in Stockholm on Friday, the 23-year-old said: “This is something that has been going on for a long while and African activists are trying so hard to be heard. It gets so frustrating when no one really cares.” She said she had received messages from other activists who had experienced similar things but were too scared to speak out or who did not receive much attention when they did.“It’s really sad that the incident happened,” she said. “But when I look at it in a more positive way, it has actually made the world set their eyes on the activists in Africa and try as much as possible to listen to their stories. So I’m actually very optimistic about this and I believe that it is going to change the stories of different climate activists in Africa.”Nakate joined the press conference by videolink along with other African climate activists.Thunberg said at the event: “It’s quite obvious I get a certain kind of media attention. If I say something, it turns into a headline. Of course, that is not the case for pretty much all other climate activists, especially from the global south, unfortunately.”Speaking of what happened to Nakate at Davos, Thunberg said: “Since Vanessa is my friend, it was very hard to see what she had to experience there, and we tried to support each other through that.”Makenna Muigai, an activist from Nairobi, Kenya, told the press conference: “Africa at large is being affected by the negative impacts of climate change. A great example is the locust infestation in east Africa, which will soon lead to food insecurity. The sad thing is, lots of people from western countries are unaware as to why this is happening.”Ndoni Mcunu, a climate scientist from the Global Change Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, highlighted how the continent was already feeling the impact of the climate crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6caddb9759b9968003e022181e4386b1ea1e00d7/0_159_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4366075dc43fdce44c30602cf0ab1315","title":"former energy minister removed as un climate talks chair","story":"Source says officials in COP26 unit could not work with Claire O’Neill in run-up to Glasgow talksClaire O’Neill, the former UK energy minister who was to lead the UN climate talks this year in Glasgow, has been removed from the post.Her sacking comes as Boris Johnson prepares to launch the UK’s strategy for hosting November’s crunch climate talks, known as COP26.O’Neill, under her Twitter handle of @COP26President, wrote on Friday evening: “Very sad that the role I was offered by Boris Johnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall ‘can’t cope’ with an indy COP unit. A shame we haven’t had one climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the COP team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.”The dramatic last-minute change of plan follows murmurings over the past month that O’Neill, known under her previous married name of Perry when she was a minister, lacked the gravitas for one of the most important jobs in international politics this year.A source in the COP26 unit said: “Claire has seriously underperformed, including at Davos and on a recent ministerial visit to India. She had said ‘the Paris agreement is dead’ in key meetings to the surprise of everyone.“She didn’t seem to get that this is a diplomatic job. The senior team of officials in the unit couldn’t work with her and her erratic behaviour and poor performance has spooked key stakeholders in the UK and internationally. She had to go. The PM now needs to show he is taking this seriously by appointing a heavy-hitting minister.”Achieving the consensus needed among world governments will be a mammoth task – many countries, including the US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are now hostile to the Paris agreement, and others including China and India have been unwilling to make big new public commitments under the accord.O’Neill’s previous experience peaked at junior minister, which was regarded by some diplomats as not enough to gain her the respect needed to get meetings with premiers and top officials around the world.Observers of the UN talks interpreted her removal as a sign that Johnson was taking COP26 more seriously. He will make his first public intervention on the issue next Tuesday, when he will launch the UK’s COP26 strategy, at an event with Sir David Attenborough, the climate expert Lord Stern, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the UN’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, and a host of dignitaries.“A good COP president makes all the difference between success and failure,” said one former high-level diplomat and COP veteran. “They direct the negotiations, they play the key role in determining the outcome.”Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G, said he thought that either William Hague or Michael Howard, both former Conservative party leaders, could be possible choices to replace O’Neill. “If this is a sign that the government really wants to signal its intent to make a success of COP26, it has to appoint some more senior people, and those two candidates come to mind,” he said.The Cabinet Office, which has been leading on the COP26 talks, declined to say whether a successor had been chosen. There have been rumours among climate activists that Zac Goldsmith could take on the role, and O’Neill’s tweet appeared to suggest that responsibility for COP26 could be taken away from the Cabinet Office.The Cabinet Office put out a statement: “Claire Perry O’Neill will no longer be UK COP26 president. The prime minister is grateful to Claire for her work preparing for what will be a very successful and ambitious climate change summit in Glasgow in November. Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly. Going forward, this will be a ministerial role.”That could leave the way open for a House of Lords appointee.Responsibility for the UK’s participation in the annual talks was previously held by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, after the closure of the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Another COP expert said whoever took on the job must have the clear and public backing of the prime minister, and that Johnson must take a much stronger public role on the issue.In her parliamentary career, O’Neill was best known for having to apologise when, unable to catch the Speaker’s eye, she wondered aloud in the House of Commons to whom she needed to “give a blowjob” in order to get her say.She also issued a putdown to David Davis when he confused her with another female Tory minister, Caroline Nokes. Referring to Davis’s previous campaigning slogan, she is reported to have told him: “David, let me help you: Caroline is a C cup, I am a double D.”Her exuberant manner also led to trouble. In November 2018, three unions wrote to BEIS, where she was a minister, to raise allegations of shouting and bullying civil servants.O’Neill started out as a political radical. The environmentalist George Monbiot recalls her at Brasenose College, Oxford, where she studied geography, as “a leftwing firebrand who wanted to overthrow capitalism and nationalise the banks. She was impressive and persuasive, and had some influence on my thinking. You can imagine my disappointment when she took a City job and became a Tory.”She entered parliament with the coalition government in 2010, her no-nonsense approach belying the patronising “Cameron cutie” label.O’Neill announced her decision to resign as an MP last September, citing the pressures of the COP26 presidency, and she stood down in December’s election. That left her free to jet to foreign capitals, but outside cabinet discussions.Johnson’s government is vulnerable to charges that ministers are not prepared to make the hard decisions required against vested interests in fossil fuels and finance. There was a major hiccup at the Africa summit last week when, as Johnson pledged not to invest in coal in Africa, the  drew attention to the almost £2bn finance from the UK pouring into African oil and gas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19f713a9adceff9a652455cc319fcd42d8bf3fb/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=da121d04ccc605ac6f0c8fd90c200291 2020w","title":"brad pitts reinvention oscar","story":"As final votes are cast, the Hollywood heavyweight has been putting in a winning - and carefully calibrated – turn as a wise-cracking sageEvery awards season has its darling. An actor whose modesty, wit and earnest embrace of the Oscar race charms both punters and peers. Last year, it was Richard E Grant, whose 30-year career – and longstanding friendship with numerous A-listers – was successfully redacted for a new narrative: he was a wide-eyed starlet gasping at the sight of Lady Gaga.This year’s homecoming king is 56-year-old Brad Pitt: an evergreen A-lister who has managed a third-act reinvention as, simultaneously, a veteran, an unknown (thanks to a strategic decision to wear his name tag at the Oscar nominees’ lunch), a frontrunner, an underdog, a footloose bachelor and half of Hollywood’s best-loved power couple.Most surprising, perhaps, has been Pitt’s sudden emergence as a public speaker of rare zip and self-awareness. The actor’s acceptance speeches at the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards, where his performance as a zen stuntman in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood won him best supporting actor, made headlines for their well-crafted wisecracks.In the former, after a nod to Leonardo DiCaprio’s fate in Titanic (“I would have shared the raft”), he explained he’d hoped to bring his mother as his plus-one, “but any woman I stand next to they say I’m dating and it’d just be awkward”. At the SAGs, he began by saying he’d have to update his Tinder profile, teased his director about his foot fetish (“Quentin has separated more women from their shoes than the TSA”), then indulged in superlative self-satire. His part in the film, he said, was “a big stretch: a guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn’t get on with his wife.”“The idea that Pitt has a speechwriter is not news,” says Anne Thompson, Indiewire’s editor-at-large. “They all use them. Carrie Fisher used to do it. This one is good, whoever they are.”“Every one of the competing films has a PR team that brainstorm, write, manage, promote and do everything possible to control every single moment and decision of the campaign,” adds Steven Gaydos, editor-in-chief of Variety. The financial and artistic stakes are too high for anything other than micro-management. The script for such a key lobbying platform would never be left in the hands of an amateur.Or, even, a film-maker: it’s rumoured a Netflix insider has drafted all the potential acceptance speeches for Marriage Story, while names mooted to be behind Pitt’s bon mots include Saturday Night Live stars Nick Kroll and John Mulaney. “Everything is very carefully curated,” says Thompson. “The awards teams behind each of these films have talking points, things they want to get across.”In the case of Pitt, these include his emergence from domestic and addiction woes (“We know pain, we know loneliness,” he said at the SAGs) and his newfound singleton status. This is balanced by an amplification of his “good-old-boy qualities … leaning into jokes that men will laugh at,” says Thompson. Phrases such as “holy moly” have made an appearance. He refers to his colleagues as brothers and sisters, to DiCaprio as “an all-star, a gent”.Also key is the dovetailing of Pitt’s podium persona with his character in the film: macho yet laconic, tough yet up for concluding a speech with a shoutout for kindness. This ensures he acts as a goodwill conduit for a film many voters might not feel is quite worthy of a top prize (just, says Thompson, as Laura Dern is likely to become “the win” for Marriage Story).Another of Pitt’s strengths is his willingness to play the game. While his chief rival in the supporting actor category – The Irishman’s Joe Pesci – does no press and rarely attends awards ceremonies, Pitt is the opposite. “He has an incredibly engaging, warm and open acceptance of the rigours of campaigning,” says Gaydos. “Night after night, day after day, he’s attending an endless stream of events and when called upon to collect another award, he’s shown a side of himself that is sincere, witty and appreciative.”Hollywood’s renewed crush on its longtime darling is also self-protection, thinks Gaydos. At a time when the bona fide movie star is under threat, Pitt acts as the ultimate poster boy.The ace up Pitt’s sleeve, however, remains the real-life drama in which so many still invest: whether he and ex-wife Jennifer Aniston – now both orced from their second spouses – could reconnect. His marital-discord crack at the SAGs was warmly applauded by Aniston in the audience, and photos of the pair congratulating one other backstage have proved an irresistible crumb to millions hoping for a reunion.“Hollywood is a small town. And they genuinely still like each other,” says Thompson. “But Brad and Jen knew they were being photographed. Movie stars are calculating everything all the time. They make clever calculations that become viral moments. That’s how they stay movie stars.”Whether or not a reconciliation occurs, the warmth such a prospect engenders will likely help buoy the belle of this year’s ball to his first on-screen Oscar. “Oh yeah,” says Thompson. “There’s no way it’s not gonna be Brad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50eeae5025eb0653ca1646d22471c5f57272b1d4/0_1335_6923_4152/master/6923.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee7f4615fccd28f4b1d6c2e81597193d","title":"cocktail of the week kerridges avocado cooler","story":"Hair of the dog won’t get much better than this gin and lime with a backdrop of smashed avocado and gingerIf you’ve managed to make it all the way through dry January without a single slip-up, congratulations and here’s a refreshing reintroduction to booze to kickstart the rest of the year.

A number of options were explored, ultimately bringing relatively risk-free loan deals for the centre-back Pablo Marí and right-back Cédric Soares. A month ago Arteta was concerned about the prospect of high-profile departures but Granit Xhaka’s situation was smoothed over and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is going nowhere for now. Nick AmesInjuries forced Villa to get busy in January and they will need their reinforcements to make rapid impacts if they are to stay up this season. Goalkeeper Pepe Reina has made an impressive start as a replacement for Tom Heaton, and Danny Drinkwater has looked rusty but vaguely promising in midfield. The big question is whether Mbwana Samatta and Borja Bastón can provide the sharpness up front that Villa have lacked. Paul DoyleEddie Howe will have breathed a sigh of relief when Manchester United informed Bournemouth they had cooled their interest in Joshua King hours before the deadline, having had a bid north of £20m rejected on Thursday night. Bournemouth made inquiries themselves and were interested in loan moves for Danny Rose, Bertrand Traoré and Jacob Bruun Larsen but finished up with what they started, having retained King, Nathan Aké and Ryan Fraser, with the latter being able to leave on a free this summer. Ben FisherGraham Potter added another exciting youngster to his Sussex stable in Tariq Lamptey, who made his Chelsea debut under Frank Lampard this season and, having sown the seeds, they activated a permanent move for Aaron Mooy after the Australia midfielder impressed. Meanwhile Argentina international Alexis Mac Allister returned from a loan spell at Boca Juniors and Glenn Murray stayed put, despite firm Championship interest, most notably from promotion-chasing Nottingham Forest. BFSean Dyche promised a quiet January transfer window and Burnley’s business was typically unspectacular, with just one signing from the Championship in Josh Brownhill and another departure in Nahki Wells, the latter leaving after never making a Premier League start and spending most of his time out on loan. Ben Gibson and Matej Vydra stayed at Turf Moor, despite being unhappy with their lack of game time. Paul WilsonIns Josh Brownhill (Bristol City, £8m), Henri Ogunby (Manchester City, undisclosed) Out Nahki Wells (Bristol City, £5m), Adam Phillips (Morecambe, loan), Ryan Cooney (Morecambe, loan), Scott Wilson (Blyth Spartans, loan), Will Harris (Warrington Town, loan), Tunde Bayode (Curzon Ashton, loan), Anthony Glennon (Grimsby Town, loan), Josh Benson (Grimsby Town, loan), Rob Harker (Hartlepool United, loan)The transfer ban was lifted but business was slow. Frank Lampard’s search for extra firepower ended in frustration – late moves for Edinson Cavani and Dries Mertens went nowhere – and the failure to bring in cover for Tammy Abraham meant Olivier Giroud, who wanted to join Inter, stayed put. Expect a bigger push in the summer, when Chelsea will look to sign Jadon Sancho and Timo Werner. Jacob SteinbergRoy Hodgson’s priority was to sign a striker and a right-back in this window: the first came off in the form of Everton’s Cenk Tosun on loan, but Nathan Ferguson’s failed move from West Brom meant that Palace could not find a belated replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Missing out on Ferguson, as well as Hull’s Jarrod Bowen, will not have helped the manager’s mood. Ed AaronsCarlo Ancelotti’s first window as manager passed quietly which, with the new man still assessing his squad and Everton announcing record losses of almost £112m for the year to June 2019, was no great surprise. The club maintain no formal offer was received for Richarlison from Barcelona, although that may change in the summer, and were unable to shift deadwood such as Oumar Niasse and Cuco Martina. Andy HunterIn Jarrad Branthwaite (Carlisle United, undisclosed) Outs Kieran Dowell (Wigan, loan) Callum Connolly (Fleetwood, loan) Cenk Tosun (Crystal Palace, loan) Antony Evans (Paderborn, undisclosed) Lewis Gibson (Fleetwood, loan) Morgan Feeney (Tranmere Rovers, loan), Jonas Lössl (Huddersfield, loan)A pleasingly quiet window for Leicester, who were never likely to sell any of their key players halfway through a season that could end with a top-four finish. The only significant arrival was Ryan Bennett, who is a useful enough reserve centre-back who is hardly expected to become a regular starter. A high-end winger would have been a welcome addition but was not needed urgently, with Harvey Barnes improving and Ayoze Pérez doing a fair job on the right. PDJürgen Klopp usually avoids January recruits but the opportunity to sign Japan international Takumi Minamino for a bargain release fee of £7.3m was one he could not resist. Understandably, given the Salzburg playmaker’s impressive displays against the runaway Premier League leaders in the Champions League this season. Otherwise it was a case of finding Rhian Brewster and Natt Phillips valuable game-time on loan. AHPep Guardiola could probably have done with a fresh frontline centre-back despite Aymeric Laporte’s recovery from injury as he only has two others: the equally inconsistent John Stones and Nicolás Otamendi. Yet despite having the option of recalling Tosin Adarabioyo from Blackburn, Guardiola was content to retain the status quo. In the summer, then, expect him to strengthen the position and possibly add a creative midfielder to replace the departing David Silva. Jamie JacksonBruno Fernandes’s arrival for £46.5m is a desperately needed boost for Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the Portugal international adding leadership and experience in midfield. The transfer deadline day scramble for a No 9 was less credible: Romelu Lukaku’s departure last summer should have presaged a replacement then instead of United’s rather last-minute move with ended with Odion Ighalo joining on loan for the rest of the season. JJSteve Bruce has added quality at left-back in the shape of Danny Rose, while Valentino Lazaro brings creativity on the wing and Nabil Bentaleb central midfield stability. Yet, with a bid for Olivier Giroud having proved forlorn, does Newcastle’s worryingly coy forward line contain sufficient goals? And might Rose and Bentaleb turn into the troublemakers some at their parent clubs, Tottenham and Schalke, predict? Louise TaylorThere was more than a hint of “preparing for life in the Championship” about Norwich’s January window. Lukas Rupp arrived from Hoffenheim after an unheralded career in the Bundesliga. Two younger talents – Melvin Sitti and Sam McCallum – were brought in and loaned back to their parent clubs immediately. Only one addition, attacking midfielder Ondrej Duda, looks to have been signed for immediate impact valued by Daniel Farke at £25m, he came in on loan. Paul MacInnesIf it ain’t broke why fix it? Propelled by a combination of expert coaching and rare collective spirit Chris Wilder’s side have defied all expectations. But treading water can also be perilous and Wilder looks to have added real quality in the shape of the Norway midfielder and record signing Sander Berge. Meanwhile the pacy Dutch striker Richairo Zivkovic can only intensify competition for attacking places after arriving on loan from China’s Changchun Yatai, while a loan move for Greece international defender Panos Retsos strengthens options at the back. LTA satisfying window for Ralph Hasenhüttl, who beat off competition from Premier League rivals to land Kyle Walker-Peters on loan from Tottenham. The full-back will likely slot in at right-back to fill the void left by Cédric Soares, who has joined Arsenal, and provide competition for the fit-again Yan Valery, but can also play at left-back. Leicester enquired about Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard but balked at his asking price, with Southampton determined to recoup the £18m they paid for the defender. BFJosé Mourinho wanted a striker to cover for the injured Harry Kane and he did not get one, meaning he has at least a further two-and-a-half months without a recognised senior No9. He lost the experience of Christian Eriksen and Danny Rose but gained the youthful promise of Steven Bergwijn and Gedson Fernandes. David HytnerNigel Pearson always said that Watford were unlikely to do significant business in this window, and so it proved – the club, 19th in the league, perhaps finding that any player talented and ambitious enough for them to be interested was also too talented and ambitious to join them, while also being frustrated in several attempts to get rid of players, on loan or otherwise. The Brazilian forward João Pedro has arrived, with more fanfare than impact so far, but he has youth on his side. Simon BurntonRelegation fears led to a frantic dash in the final week of the window. West Ham strengthened their midfield after signing Tomas Soucek on loan with an option to buy for €20.5m and concerns about the attack saw David Moyes pip Crystal Palace and Newcastle to the £22.5m signing of Hull’s Jarrod Bowen. Moyes also sorted out the goalkeeping situation, signing Darren Randolph as cover for Lukasz Fabianski and shipping Roberto off to Alavés on loan. JSNuno Espírito Santo openly pleaded for new signings to help his team continue to challenge for Champions League qualification while advancing in the Europa League, but Wolves only made one purchase. Daniel Podence, a forward most at home on the wing, became the third most expensive recruit in the club’s history when he joined for £17m from Olympiakos. That welcome addition still leaves Wolves very reliant on their one senior specialist striker, Raúl Jiménez, especially after the departure of Patrick Cutrone. Central midfield could also do with more depth.

The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad75a0d8811bdbfe5fe2ea126b1c5a239162711d/2_0_8027_4819/master/8027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=541bebb424d9986db7bbb0591562a6ad","title":"eminem gone too far as a comedian i may not be the best judge romesh ranganathan","story":"Some people make jokes about my lazy eye – they are frequently woeful, but I am never offendedEminem’s new album has seen him criticised and cancelled for a lyric about the Manchester bombing: “I’m contemplating yelling ‘bombs away’ on the game like I’m outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting.” Many people, including the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, have expressed disgust, with some others saying they will never listen to Eminem again. In response, Eminem has explained that these are simply words, and that his Alfred Hitchcock-inspired album was intended to shock. People have also pointed out that, in his defence, he tweeted his sympathies after the 2017 attack, encouraging people to donate.Some will undoubtedly see the cancellation of Eminem as censorship, and an example of how easily offended we have become. But the truth is that nobody is stopping Eminem from saying exactly what he wants. If anything, the furore has done him a favour. He has a track record here. On The Slim Shady LP, he included a song about killing the mother of his child, putting the body in the boot of his car, and then driving his daughter to the sea to dispose of the body. The Manchester lyric might be shocking if it came from Little Mix, but Eminem trades in controversy.What is true is that offence and its implications have been amplified, and that people feel increasingly righteous about being offended. When I was warming up for my tour, I did a show during which I discussed the environment. The routine was going over fine, until a girl interrupted to tell me that my jokes were undermining the seriousness of the situation, and that she could not bear to listen any more. She left, with her boyfriend apologising as they went.She may well have been right, and she had every right to leave. But what I found incredible was that she had the courage to interrupt a routine that the audience were all laughing at to express her disgust, and make a show of walking out. In my opinion, the correct response is to be quietly offended, and then decide whether you want to see that show or person again. But people don’t seem to “do” quiet offence any more.I admit that being a comedian doesn’t make me the best judge of what is acceptable. Comics are so used to making jokes about anything and everything that they stop being offended anything goes, as long as it’s in the form of a joke. Your wiring gets realigned. My social media timelines are full of people making jokes about my lazy eye: they are frequently woeful, but I am never offended.Eminem is an often brilliant rapper, and he does clever offence better than almost anybody. But I have to admit this particular lyric feels like a reach, even to me. It doesn’t really work as a simile, and you can see the workings, which is unusual for someone of his talent. (If you are going to defend people’s right to say what they want, you also have to accept that sometimes the quality won’t be that great.)There’s also an argument that we are targeting the rapper for the wrong reasons. If we really want to bring Eminem down, we need to focus our energies on the ways in which he has been most offensive: his collaboration with Ed Sheeran, for one, and his absolutely dreadful facial hair.• This article was amended on 31 January 2020 to give the full title of Andy Burnham as the mayor of Greater Manchester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0cac168d693cdb9429b26f046ec807387bb1f9c/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6906d3c2ffa4158efbded839c407f7a9","title":"first kondo now cosy but do you have to buy into lifestyle trends","story":"Beware the tricks of consumer capitalism Minimalism is dead. The lifestyle trend that dominated the 2010s expired late last year, when Marie Kondo launched an online store selling upmarket housewares, thereby destroying the pretence that decluttering was about buying less stuff, as opposed to making space for new stuff. Kyle Chayka’s new book, The Longing For Less: Living With Minimalism, might serve as its obituary. Minimalism seemed like “a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism... is literally destroying the planet,” he writes. But it soon became just another mode of materialism – a way for the system that caused the problem to make more money by selling what it claimed would be the cure.It’s a testament to the ingenuity of consumer capitalism that both minimalism and the trend known variously as “domestic cosy” or “the homebody economy” frame their appeal as anti-consumerist where minimalism is supposedly about owning less, the cosiness trend urges a retreat from the world of getting and spending to the purportedly non-commercial spaces of hearth and bedroom. But it’s a trick, obviously. They may be marketing the message of “enoughness”, but really they’re promoting the idea on which all consumerism depends: that what you have right now isn’t enough, and that something needs buying before you can feel at ease.The only genuine way to resist is by entertaining the possibility that, actually, your living room or bed sheets are fine as they are, and that if anything needs to change in your life – perhaps it doesn’t! – it might not require any purchases. (“Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes,” said Henry David Thoreau.)Which isn’t to say there’s not a kernel of something important in the turn toward the domestic, local, and near-at-hand, as indicated in a line from the poet and ecologist Gary Snyder: “The most radical thing you can do is stay home.” It’s just that I’m pretty sure Snyder didn’t mean it was time to replace all your blankets and saucepans with expensively homely upgrades.The essayist Rebecca Solnit considers the radicalism of embracing ‘the localised world’ in an article for Orion Magazine, available online."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb55fc4adc99fd03dc64453989477f7ffdb99f20/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39573e80a3b91085aac86ad03c6760ef","title":"we are emigrating but our children dont want to annalisa barbieri","story":"Listen to their concerns, says Annalisa Barbieri, but remember that you are the adultsI am a European who has been living in London for more than 20 years. During this time, I finished my studies, got a job, met a husband (from another European country), had three children and lived a happy life. The uncertainties surrounding our work environment and this country, combined with great job opportunities for my husband and I, have led us to take the decision to move back to my home country. This is going to be a big change in our life and we have tried to look at it from many different angles. While we see benefits for ourselves and our children, we have worries about the transition period: how we will adjust to this new environment whether we will be able to re-establish a happy balance in our family unit and mostly, whether our children, all under 13, who have made friends here and are reluctant to leave, will be able to cope. Will they lose their sense of identity and their self-esteem in the new school environment? Will they turn into adults who move to different places when challenges arise? Are there any dos and don’ts to consider as a family and as parents?This is an exciting time, but things are going to happen that you can’t predict. In order to grow into resilient adults, your children will need to learn how to adapt to change, and tolerate even the negative emotions they experience. You have to let them do this.When you leave something behind, be it a school, a place of work or a country, it is easy to focus on what is being lost, because those are tangible things. It is harder to see what one will gain, yet this is an important learning curve for so many situations to come.The don’ts would include not allowing your children to express concerns or have an opinion, or shutting them down when they show emotion. But being overly positive can also be blocking. If you deny them their feelings, eventually they won’t come to you with problems, because they will feel you don’t listen. But it won’t mean the negative feelings have gone.I asked Hilary Ann Salinger, a psychotherapist, what she thought. “You’re clearly very anxious about the effect on your family dynamic,” she said. “But your anxieties are completely normal and realistic.” She echoed that this is an exciting and positive life stage, and likened it to having a baby – another seismic change you have been through and can probably recall: “You’re excited, but also terrified.” You don’t know what is going to happen, but try to take solace in the fact that, as a family, you will cope together. Have faith in your parenting skills.Salinger wanted to reassure you that you are in control of your children’s sense of identity: it is formed, she said, within the family unit (which stays static here, albeit in different surroundings), in connective relationships with others, and in how you embrace the outside world. She also said not to fear the “oppositional feelings your children may have. They may be angry if they don’t want to go.” If such conversations ensue, she recommended saying something like: “Yes, I know this is painful for you, but we think it’s the right thing to do.”If you are very in tune with your children and have raised them in a collaborative environment, being authoritative may feel challenging, and a bit different, but you can do this while still listening. And remembering that you are the adults. I sometimes explain it to my own children by saying that their opinion really matters, but I have a longer-range view of certain things that they may not be able to understand yet. Children find this easier to accept, and tolerate, if they have been listened to in the past and the relationship is not dictatorial. Salinger recommended “making the leaving process thorough: make sure they have a good experience of saying goodbye, maybe giving a talk to their classmates about where they’re going”. You can gauge if you think this will be a good idea. Encourage their curiosity about the new place and about any issues that may crop up, but don’t pretend that where you are going is perfect. Reassure them where you can – for example, about staying in touch with friends – but don’t give false promises that is what they will hang on to.If you make this a positive experience, there is no reason to think they will move every time they face a challenge. But I think you need to spend a little time untangling your own worries and fears, as well as your children’s.•Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

Photographer Tristram Kenton went to watch the Royal Opera House’s fast and furious new production of Gerald Barry’s opera take shape• Alice’s Adventures Under Ground is at the Royal Opera House, London from 3-9 Februaryby Tristram Kenton,  Mee-Lai Stone and  Imogen Tilden“I’m definitely free-range organic,” jokes Bloom, playing Humpty Dumpty. McDonald, as well as directing, has designed it all – sets, props and every costume. “Everyone’s basic costume is Victorian underwear they put their other costumes on top. I’ve been working on it for about two years. I said that a condition of my agreeing to do the production was that we had to have all the costumes and the props in rehearsal from the very beginning. That meant we could solve problems as we went along.”“The scene changes are all incredibly fast,” says McDonald. “The bottles turn to cakes in the blink of an eye, or the White Queen has to be an Oyster and then back to the White Queen. I spent a long time trying to work out how you could go from scene to scene and make the costume changes work. Barry gives very precise stage directions. If I haven’t honoured every single one of them, I’ve tried to honour the spirit of all of them.”Some of Barry’s precise stage directions include: “The scene should go like the wind …Players are guillotined randomly … Soldiers come running in through the wood, at first in twos and threes, and then at last in such crowds that they seem to fill the whole forest. They trip over something or other, and whenever one goes down, several more fall over him, so that the ground is soon covered with heaps of men.” An old, hairless teddy belonging to Barry’s partner’s brother inspired the stutterings of the White Queen, carefully annotated by Barry. “When you turn it over slowly,” he told an interviewer, “it groans a glissando from E to G. If you shake it while turning it upside-down, it produces a staccato gasp – a little cruel, I know.”The entire opera is under an hour long and is showing twice an evening on the Royal Opera House’s main stage, with two separate casts. Claudia Boyle is one of the two sopranos singing the role of Alice. “I love the humour of Barry’s music. It’s like an assault on the senses because it’s an experience as well as great music. He really pushes the orchestra and the singers to their limits. The opening scales and arpeggios as Alice falls down the rabbit hole are particularly extreme. It’s great – every coloratura soprano’s dream!”“The opera is relatively short but everything is packed in. I’m on stage most of the time … It’s intense but I love it. It feeds my soprano ego,” jokes Boyle, who originally studied as a cellist but swapped to singing “because I was sick of being in the pit and decided I wanted to be on stage!”“When I was a child I didn’t particularly take to the books,” says Boyle. “I always thought there was a darkness to them. These larger than life characters that are all a bit psychotic. Alice is a really strong girl, a great character to play. She questions things, she stands up to people rather than cowers, and she navigates herself through this rather frightening world pretty well. I much prefer playing strong characters.”I love Barry’s music. His compositions are a Frankenstein mashup of found sounds, whistles, shouts and spoken words, of snatches of tunes, old music hall songs, ear-worms from symphonies and sonatas, that he then tears to pieces and puts together again like papier mache. And then he turns it on its head because it’s so much fun. Thomas Adès“My job is to be the one point of stability in all this. The circus master if you like. His writing is very precise. He knows exactly what he wants and shows you how he wants it, when to go up in the voice, when to go down, what rhythm and when to leave tiny pauses. He reminds me of Beckett or Pinter - the pauses are as important as the music, and brilliantly convey the deep weirdness of the characters Alice encounters,” says Adès.“This is an opera for ages two to 102. Carroll’s Alice books are for the child that’s still in all of us,” says Adès. “Opera feeds the soul,” says Boyle. “It’s visceral. It’s truthful. It moves you. It’s our job to try and open it up and get more people to come to it. Works like this bring in new audiences that you hope can then grow up with opera.”Tenor Sam Furness (below) plays the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, Tweedledum, a fawn, a train passenger, the White King, a bottle and a cake. “It’s definitely up there in terms of the more extraordinary roles I’ve sung,” says Furness. “I’ve got something like 12 costume changes which all happen within a 45-minute long piece. We don’t really know where we are, we’re just being rushed along to the next thing by our dressers. At one point I have a one-and-a-half minute costume change so I can relax and take a breath. Which is nice.”“It’s exhilarating and terrifying, but I’m an adrenaline junkie so I love it,” says Furness. “Musically it’s pretty fast and furious, whatever we’re singing, and very, very high – I think I’ve used up all my high notes. Just in one two-minute section we counted the other day we’ve got 55 top Bs and six top Cs, which is like a month’s worth normally.”A male dancer – here with the author’s face as if tattooed on his chest – represents Lewis Carroll who comes and goes throughout McDonald’s production. It’s his and Alice’s dream, says McDonald.I hope people will come away feeling stimulated and excited. It’s like a kind of explosion – throwing lots of things up in the air and then they finally settle. Anything that explodes your brain is good for you, isn’t it? Antony McDonaldBarry has made a few interpolations: the Queen of Hearts’s croquet match has become a singing masterclass with Alice and orchestra in a battle of scales and arpeggios. The gyres and gimbles of Jabberwocky are shouted in German, French and Russian. At the end, instead of Alice waking up, there’s something more melancholy. “I’ve got Alice killing the White Queen as well as the Red Queen,” says McDonald, “although that’s not in Barry’s score.” It’s a valedictory moment. Leaving childhood behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13c0866968852ef980da67a40d377ce598970c5b/0_124_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76f4a9e31294ca79d7b426dfd8487172","title":"elon musk edm artist first track dont doubt ur vibe","story":"The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has dropped Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe on Soundcloud – a wannabe dancefloor banger that somehow manages to doubt its own vibeLike Charles Foster Kane splashing his millions on promoting his mistress’s disastrous opera career, very rich men have, in recent years, displayed a certain tendency to come to grief when dabbling in the field of music. First, the now-incarcerated pharma bro Martin Shkreli bought the only extant copy of the Wu-Tang Clan’s album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin and, as a result, was first called “a shithead”, “the Michael Jackson nose kid”, “the man with the 12-year-old body” and “a fake super-villain” by the group’s Ghostface Killah, and then became the subject of a Wu-Tang Clan diss track. Not, one suspects, the response he expected when he ponied up $2m for their CD. Now Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk – net worth $34.4bn – has launched a parallel career as an EDM artist, posting a track called Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe on Soundcloud.It’s bootless to point out that if it wasn’t by a tech billionaire, no one would give Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe a second thought, indistinguishable as it is from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on Soundcloud. But it is by a tech billionaire, so it racked up 270,000 plays in four hours. What they’ve heard is a vocal – apparently by Musk himself – that repeats a dreadful little motivational-poster homily ad infinitum through a vocorder over wafty mid-tempo Euro-trance. There’s a kind of rounded-edged take on an old-fashioned 303 acid line that appears about two minutes in and reappears at the track’s conclusion, and the occasional pitch-bent racing-car-speeding-past drone, but it’s been made by someone with what you might charitably describe as a shaky grasp of musical dynamics. It keeps going in for lengthy buildups that don’t actually build up to anything: the drums roll, the tension mounts, then the track just picks up where it left off. Curiously, something about the way the vocal is placed over the backing track makes it feel oddly hesitant: “Don’t doubt your vibe”, it keeps insisting, doubtfully.Ironically, what Don’t Doubt Ur Vibe really sounds like isn’t a primetime dancefloor banger, but the kind of atmospheric, inoffensive music that might play in the background at the launch of a new car. Still, at least it comes with an unexpected bonus: if you leave Soundcloud running after the track ends, the app, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear (algorithms? Mischievous intent?) immediately moves from the nascent oeuvre of Elon Musk to the work of a rapper called almndjoy, automatically playing his track Erectile Dysfunction, with its erting opening line “I’m sorry my dick doesn’t work”. Languishing unnoticed on Soundcloud for a year, it’s seen a vast upsurge in plays since Musk’s track made its debut, replete with a series of comments indicating that “Elon brought me here”. Perhaps that will be Elon Musk’s most lasting musical legacy: he’s brought Erectile Dysfunction to the masses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616dbf199ff2caea8da84106c7510bbaa852f760/0_0_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d941c13236c320297fa6a7dde69dd6","title":"from entry to exit what did eu membership mean for britain podcast","story":"John Palmer was the ’s correspondent in Brussels in 1973 when the UK entered the European Economic Community.

Profit from sales of his book, For the Record, which was published in September, will appear in his next set of accounts.The business, which names Cameron’s former political secretary Laurence Mann as the sole director, lists Cameron as the sole owner. It employed seven people last year. Cameron set up the business to manage his post-politics commercial life a month after resigning as MP for Witney in September 2016.Last May, Cameron took a job as chairman of the advisory board of the US artificial intelligence firm Afiniti. While prime minister, Cameron was paid £143,462 a year.He is not the first former prime minister to do well commercialising his experiences in Downing Street. Blair, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007, has been reported as having amassed a £60m fortune from sources including property and consultancy fees.Cameron has some way to go to catch up with serial job-taker George Osborne, the current editor of London’s Evening Standard newspaper. The former chancellor has at least nine jobs on the go including being paid £650,000 a year for an advisory role with the world’s largest asset management firm, BlackRock. Other roles include being an adviser to Exor, which owns Juventus and stakes in Fiat Chrysler."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c5134c6a5d8fe867ad302d485dc89fdfc60aa7/0_44_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9bdf57192dc89df4a09848ad1b66388","title":"how are you feeling about brexit day","story":"Whatever your plans we want to hear from you as the UK officially leaves the EUThe UK will officially leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday.

With a lump in its throat and a poignant song of farewell – or with cheers and a raised middle finger of defiant good riddance? The answer that Britain gave at 11pm on Friday 31 January 2020 was: both. The UK broke from the European Union on a late winter’s night with both jubilation and regret, as ided on the day of leaving as it had been in deciding to leave. For some Britons, this was Independence Day. For others, it was a national bereavement.In Westminster, Nigel Farage exulted with his fellow Brexiters in Parliament Square, delighted that a prize they had sought for a quarter century, and that once seemed laughably improbable, was in their hands at last. “We did it,” he told the ecstatic crowd. “We transformed the landscape of our country.” At the stroke of 11pm, he led a chorus of the national anthem.In Downing Street, a countdown clock had beamed on to the outside walls as if impatient for the moment, like children waiting for Christmas. Inside, Boris Johnson – who had been the face and totem of the Vote Leave campaign of 2016 – hailed “the dawn of a new era”, the curtain going up on “a new act in our great national drama”. Surrounded by cabinet colleagues and veterans of the referendum campaign, the prime minister toasted their success with English sparkling wine, washing down a Brexit day feast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and Shropshire blue cheese, a spread pointedly free of the taint of the dreaded continent. Along the Mall, union jacks fluttered brightly.There was merch for those who wanted it: you could buy a Got Brexit Done tea-towel, perhaps using a handful of commemorative Brexit 50p pieces. If you were in Morley, you could join Andrea Jenkyns’ Big Brexit Bash, to celebrate what the Yorkshire MP called an end to “a hellish four years” and the start of what was sure to be “a golden decade”, with Britons at last in charge of their own destiny, free of the shackles of Brussels. Sunderland, first to declare for leave in 2016, had the joy of hosting a special Brexit day meeting of the cabinet.Melancholy was the mood of a procession on Friday afternoon from Downing Street to the London offices of the European commission, staged, the organisers said, “to say goodbye to our old friend”. Clad in blue and gold, they numbered just a few hundred: hard to believe that a million or more marched in their cause a matter of months ago. In Frome, Somerset, they gathered for a late-night vigil at an installation known as the European Community of Stones, a semi-circular henge of 12 boulders, one quarried from each of the EU’s 12 members when it was built in 1992. They sang the EU anthem, Ode to Joy, in recognition of the “sense of excitement, of opportunity, the EU represented”, said local Green party councillor Martin Dimery. For him, the EU was “the greatest international project for peace, prosperity and progress”, and now Britain will play no part in it. What was the point of a ceremony to mark that fact? “Every death deserves a funeral.”That elegiac quality has been a constant note sounded through these final days of UK membership, expressed most intensely in that widely shared footage of the European parliament rising to its feet to sing Auld Lang Syne to a departing Britain (confirming this is a wrench for them as well as us). It was the sadness of saying goodbye not to an institution, but to an idea – of friendship across the sea, of harmony between nations, of a resolve that a continent riven by the bloodiest of wars would live out its future in peace.So while Downing Street had its clock, remainers had a projection of their own: a film beamed on to the white cliffs of Dover, featuring two veterans of the second world war, both in their 90s, speaking of their sadness at the coming of this hour. They would miss the “comradeship” of the European Union, they said, adding the hope that “we will be back together before too long”. The film, the work of the Led by Donkeys group, ended with an image of a single gold star from the European flag. “This is our star,” said the message. “Look after it for us.”And that was the plea contained in so many remainer goodbyes, the hope that this is not forever. That afternoon procession in Whitehall was headlined “À bientôt EU, see you soon.” A departing Scottish MEP asked the EU 27 “to leave a light on, so we can find our way home.”The Royal Society of Literature posted an image from AA Milne: Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, hand in hand, walking into the sunset, above the caption, “But, of course, it isn’t really Good-bye, because the Forest will always be there… and anybody who is Friendly with Bears can find it.”Farage was having none of that, of course. “Once we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail,” he had said, in his parting shot to the European parliament, before, in a metaphor made flesh, he had his microphone cut off by the chair: Brexit party MEPs had broken parliamentary rules by waving union jack flags. “Put your flags away … and take them with you,” the chair said. “You are leaving.”So for all Johnson’s talk of healing, there was no agreement between leave and remain at the moment of parting – except on one thing. Both saw 11pm as chiming in an epochal shift in the history of these islands. True, nothing material altered at that moment. The UK that wakes up on Saturday will still have to stick to EU rules and pay into the EU budget, albeit without any say, until 31 December. Britons can still go through the EU citizens line at the airport. Things will only get real on the first day of 2021.In that sense, 11pm ushered in a period of Brexit nirvana for Boris Johnson. For the next 11 months, he will have the best of both worlds: he can say he’s got Brexit done, and enjoy the benefits of EU membership. All the political gain, with none of the economic pain. Truly, he will have his cake and eat it.Still, leaving the EU marks the biggest change in our national life since 1973, when Britain joined, if not since 1945, given that today’s EU is so much larger and more significant than the Common Market of 47 years ago. The new political landscape will be wholly different. The pressure for Scottish independence will be greater than ever: at 11pm Scotland was taken out of the EU against its will. Irish unification will have a new, pressing logic, one that will only increase as Britain erges from the EU, thickening that border down the Irish Sea. Meanwhile, Westminster, and especially Conservative, politics will have lost its perennial bogeyman, its reliable scapegoat for all ills: Brussels.Some remainers believe – and maybe even hope – that the shine will come off Brexit pretty soon. They point to new government advice warning citizens that, come next year, they could face roaming charges when they use their phones on the continent that they’ll need health insurance or a special driving licence or a visa to work or study that they’ll have to queue in the slower, non-EU lane at the airport. Remainers still have their charts, projecting a UK economy turned anaemic once Britain goes it alone. They are poised, ready to declare: “I told you so.”But all that is over the horizon. For now, Britain has made one of its periodic shifts away from the continent, in a relationship that has blown hot and cold for at least 1,200 years. Even the eighth century King Offa of Mercia fretted about trading links across the Channel. In that long sweep of history, the 47 years we spent as Britain-in-Europe might come to look like a blip. Alternatively, so might Brexit. Those draped in blue-and-gold flags could be right: Britain might one day be back, even if all but the most optimistic rejoiners believe that day is decades away.In Parliament Square, site of hoarse slanging matches for the past four years, the crowds on both sides were thinner on Friday night, at least before the Farage rally got going. The leavers were beaming, proud in their sweatshirts bearing the slogan: Job Done. They believe spring is coming. The remainers were wrapped up against the cold, braced against a January night, which, to them, felt like the bleakest midwinter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75843a9541dadd4c9a8cbe9b8f715f7956c6e4ba/769_769_2179_1308/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d78f67f5003e61249ad788a20e77b071","title":"judge orders welsh tories lift suspension assembly member nick ramsay","story":"Judge finds in favour of Nick Ramsay after he was arrested and released without chargeThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives has been ordered by a high court judge to lift the suspension of an assembly member pending further legal action.Nick Ramsay, 44, was suspended from the Tory group after being arrested at his home in Raglan, Monmouthshire, on New Year’s Day. Gwent police released him the following afternoon, saying he would face no further action, but his suspension remained.Ramsay is suing Paul Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, at the high court.At a hearing in Bristol, Judge Jonathan Russen QC ordered the lifting of the suspension until a trial into the matter takes place in February. “In my judgment, it is appropriate that he is restored to the membership of the group,” Russen said.The court heard Ramsay was elected to the Welsh assembly in 2007 and became a member of the Conservative group.He was arrested on the evening of 1 January and spent the night in custody in Newport before being released without charge the following day. At 1.31pm on 2 January, Davies emailed Ramsay to tell him he had “no option” but to suspend him from the Welsh Conservatives.Representing Ramsay, David Lock QC said Davies “lacked the power” to do so and had not conformed to the rules of the group’s constitution. In a written statement, Ramsay said he was at his “wits’ end” and sought the assistance of the high court to end the stalemate.Richard Price QC, representing Davies, asked for an adjournment to prepare for the case as he had been given less than 24 hours’ notice.Price said eight members of the 11-strong assembly group had supported the suspension and it was not the case that Davies had “acted solo”.“The defendant and the other members of the group who are involved in the process are concerned there is a risk, if your lordship were to refuse my application for an adjournment, that this matter would be decided simply on the back of the evidence of the claimant alone,” he told the judge.The judge refused the application for an adjournment and allowed the interim injunction until the case is heard at a three-day trial in February. He said his ruling did not affect the disciplinary processes of the group.Speaking outside court, Ramsay said: “I am disappointed that I had to come to court today to achieve this result. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving my constituents and discharging my public functions.”The trial is to be listed at a court in either Bristol, Cardiff or London between 19 and 21 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8543651afbf5577d5b7a316702e61c84768dd2/0_118_3539_2123/master/3539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d315d4cbe16a0b7e180aa8d3dddfe2c","title":"keir starmer labour should argue for return of free movement brexit","story":"Leadership frontrunner says party has to make the case for benefits of migrationSir Keir Starmer has said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit, if he becomes Labour’s next leader.The shadow Brexit secretary said his party must not be afraid to argue for free movement, and that EU citizens should receive “rights, not tolerance” from the UK.“We need to make the wider case on immigration,” he said, speaking at a leadership event at Westminster Cathedral in London.“We welcome migrants, we don’t scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services, are not the fault of people who come here: they’re political failure. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration for the benefits of free movement.“I want people in this country to be able to go and work abroad, in Europe and I want people in Europe to be able to come and work here. I want families to be able to live together – whether that’s in Europe, or here.”Asked whether that meant he would argue for free movement to be restored, he replied: “Of course: bring back, argue for, challenge.”Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.Freedom of movement will formally end when the UK leaves the EU on Friday evening – though the accompanying rights will be retained during the transition period, which is due to end on 31 December.Starmer appeared to be arguing for a new, but similar, arrangement to be negotiated reciprocally, as part of negotiations about the UK’s future relationship with the EU27.By contrast, Boris Johnson’s government plans to introduce a points-based migration regime that would no longer give EU citizens a free pass.Speaking on Brexit day, Starmer urged his colleagues, some of whom have been ardent remainers, to “let go”.“We leave the EU tonight, and the leaveremain ide goes with it. That ide has cut across families, communities, regions, the country. And we need to let that ide go. Leaveremain ends tonight, and that includes for the Labour party.”Starmer appears to be the frontrunner in the Labour leadership race, with 85 nominations from constituency Labour parties (CLPs) so far, against 44 for Rebecca Long-Bailey and 18 for Lisa Nandy.Asked whether Labour’s policy of supporting a referendum, which he was instrumental in pushing the party to adopt, had damaged its electoral prospects, he said there were many reasons for December’s election result.“Brexit of course was among them. But the argument that Brexit alone was the reason – and we would have soared to victory untroubled, without Brexit – is just plain wrong,” he insisted, adding that the public had lost trust in Labour as “a force for good”.He denied it had been a mistake for Labour not to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal, which could have meant a closer economic relationship than that Johnson is expected to negotiate.“Theresa May’s deal was a bad deal. It didn’t protect trade union rights, workplace rights, environmental rights, consumer rights. It was a bad deal which would lead to a very, very hard Brexit and we were right to oppose it. Let’s not rewrite that. Let’s not pretend that it was a good deal, somehow.”The first stage of the contest was for potential contenders to get the backing of 22 fellow MPs by 13 January. Five MPs passed this threshold: Keir Starmer (88 nominations),\u0026nbsp Rebecca Long-Bailey (33), Lisa Nandy (31), Jess Phillips (23) and Emily Thornberry (23).The ballot of members and registered supporters opens a week later on 21 February, and closes at noon on 2 April. To be eligible to vote you must have been a Labour member on 20 January, or have applied to have become a £25 registered supporter by 16 January.Corbyn’s successor will be announced at a special conference in London on 4 April.Starmer also criticised Johnson, saying he was the worst of the three Tory prime ministers he has seen since he became an MP in 2015. He described him as a man “without any principle or anchor”.“We don’t give up on the fight for a close economic relationship which protects our jobs and our economy. We don’t give up on the argument that we need to collaborate and cooperate with our EU partners, on scientific research, medical research, arts, culture, education. We don’t give up on the argument on security either,” he said.“We need to give our EU citizens rights, not tolerance: and that starts with the right to vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94b8d294b86c19908253c675c147f504355f1d35/414_684_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7065aaa60cb0efc07f2ff9aa10190a1","title":"the ins and outs of brexit in pictures","story":"On 31 January, the UK will finally leave the European Union after years of tense negotiations, resignations and a controversial prorogation.

For those of you who have reached this liveblog via our alert – you can follow all the latest news in this new liveblog (which will go live at 7am GMT)Here’s a summary of the day’s events:Despite what the UK government may say, Brexit is far from ‘done’. We guide you through the difficult next steps in the negotiations:At 11pm GMT on 31 January, Britain officially left the EU after 47 years of membership. Downing Street marked the moment by beaming a virtual Big Ben on to No 10 to chime. Nearby, in Parliament Square, Nigel Farage led a rendition of God Save the QueenHere’s some of Westminster’s reaction to the confirmation that the UK has left the EU:The United Kingdom will remain a key partner for the European Union. I look forward to what I hope will be a very close cooperation with our British friends on our common challenges at the regional and global level.There were huge cheers in Parliament Square as a simulated Big Ben chimed 11pm GMT to mark the UK’s official exit from the EU.Nigel Farage spoke to a roaring crowd of thousands of Brexit supporters as he hailed the “point of no return” and the victory of “the people beating the establishment”.After Farage led the countdown, the crowd joined in a rendition of the national anthem, many waving Union flags.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said:I am pleased the UK and EU have agreed on a Brexit deal that honours the will of the British people. We will continue building upon our strong, productive, and prosperous relationship with the UK as they enter this next chapter.While Downing Street has been counting down to Brexit this evening, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has been focusing on protecting the city’s reputation for openness:How does a nation say goodbye to its neighbours? With a lump in its throat and a poignant song of farewell – or with cheers and a raised middle finger of defiant good riddance? The answer that Britain gave at 11pm on Friday 31 January 2020 was: both. The UK broke from the European Union on a late winter’s night with both jubilation and regret, as ided on the day of leaving as it had been in deciding to leave. For some Britons, this was Independence Day. For others, it was a national bereavement.As the UK takes the unprecedented step of leaving the EU, prominent voices from each remaining member state say goodbye:The United Kingdom has left the European Union.As the clock struck 11pm GMT, the nation officially enacted the biggest constitutional change in living memory and, in doing so, became the first member state ever to leave the EU.The momentous shift follows more than three years of political wrangling that has seen off two prime ministers and brought about radical change within the two main political parties.The UK now enters a transition period that is due to run until the end of the year and during which the government is charged with the task of redrawing the country’s relationship with its closest neighbours.Nigel Farage has taken to the stage at the Brexit celebration rally in central London. The Brexit party leader has said:In just 14 minutes’ time something truly remarkable is going to happen. Something that I fought for for 27 years and something many thousands of you have given your time and money for.In 13 minutes’ time we will leave the European Union. We did it. We transformed the landscape of our country. There are some that say we shouldn’t celebrate tonight, but we are going to celebrate tonight.There is one thing above all we must celebrate tonight and it is this: The reason we are here tonight is because Westminster became detached from the people in this country. The people have beaten the establishment. The real winner tonight is democracy. And I am someone who believes we should be pro-Europe, but not the European Union.A crowd of pro-Brexit supporters have gathered at the gates of Stormont, the seat of Northern Ireland’s devolved government, in east Belfast to count down to 11pm GMT when the UK officially leaves the EU.Many are holding Union flags and are ready to toast the moment Brexit becomes official.A Lambeg drum was played and Chinese lanterns were set to be released at 11pm. The DUP’s Jim Wells is among the crowd. The gathering, described as a thanksgiving, started with a prayer.Boris Johnson has praised Steve Barclay for his work as Brexit secretary, a role that ceases once the UK leaves the EU.The government has already confirmed that the Department for Exiting the European Union will no longer exist. The prime minister said of Barclay:On the day that the United Kingdom leaves the EU, you can take particular pride that we are delivering on our promise to the British people to get Brexit done.Your work, and that of your department, has been absolutely crucial in ensuring that we are leaving the EU with a great new deal and that we are in such a strong position going into the negotiations about our future relationship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections.

You’ll hear the clink of drinks far and wide as it’s a time for celebration for those who made it through.As someone who is attempting dry January for the first time, I’m counting down the hours myself. When midnight strikes I may no longer be an EU citizen but at least I’ll be able to enjoy a hearty Belgian beer.We asked  readers how they have got on with their attempts at Dry January in 2020. Let us know how you fared in the comments.Oh have I missed the taste of rosé! But it’s kind of inspired me to do dry February, but maybe try something different – like give up meat for a month, or sex (god forbid). It was depressing but I also found it interesting because I learned a few things about myself, like patience and discipline. I never realised how bad alcohol is on your skin, but since I’ve cut it out I’ve got the skin of a newborn again.By having no alcohol this month I have managed to lose 8lb of weight. This hasn’t been solely down to not drinking alcohol, although it has been one of the main reasons. I saw it as a chance to reset my lifestyle a bit and get into better habits. I’ll be having a few (hundred) beers on Saturday though.I quite like experimenting with fads and seeing if they make me feel different, plus I had decided to do Veganuary as well so thought I might as well go the whole way and see if it made me into Gwyneth Paltrow.I’ve noticed that drunk people really don’t like it when you’re not drinking – I’ve had loads of people shoving beers in my face trying to force me to break dry January. It’s made me notice how embedded drinking is in social situations. Also, I’ve discovered tonic and bitters, yum.My housemate was also keen to try, so I had some solidarity there. Then late on New Year’s Day my housemate and I discovered a half-drunk bottle of prosecco in the fridge and didn’t want to waste it … so we lasted maybe 15 hours. To be honest I haven’t had more than one or two days of drinking this month, so the spirit of dry January has remained.A big benefit was being horrendously smug and holier than thou, preaching the benefits of living a clean and healthy lifestyle (while secretly consuming my weight in chocolate behind closed doors). Unfortunately I haven’t ended up saving much money. The money I would’ve spent on booze I just spent elsewhere, eg on treats to congratulate myself for doing so well with dry January.One of the benefits of dry January is feeling a lot fitter. I’ve signed up to a half-marathon, I’ve been going to the gym, I’ve been training. I’ve actually been involved in a lot more creative projects. I wanted a break and I wanted a fresh start to the new year and new decade. I felt that I’ve concentrated more on the people that I’m with, the conversation, where we are, what we’re doing, as opposed to what we’re drinking and who’s getting the next drink.My friend and I had a £20 bet on who would drink first in January. I lost. I gave up after 16 days. It was extremely difficult. Not drinking changes not only your bank account but it also changes your social atmosphere. Going out to a bar with friends and ordering a ginger beerDiet Coke and sparkling water doesn’t quite cut it for me.I’m really looking forward to a pint of Guinness in my favourite pub. I feel I have much more energy and, as someone who suffers with mental health issues including anxiety, alcohol doesn’t help, so I’ve been feeling much more positive and settled in myself. My main takeaway is that it’s OK not to be out every weekend socialising. It’s OK to sit in with the feeling like you’re missing out on all the fun, because it’s quite important to have some quiet downtime.I’ve got a very big family on both sides and seeing them socially is a big part of how we spend time together. Every year it’s a split between me proving that I can do it and giving my liver a rest after over-indulging over Christmas. The benefits have been money, sleep and energy. You don’t realise how cheap a meal at a restaurant is until you don’t drink at one.I think by 1 January my body was crying out for a detox. I’m sure everyone says this, it’s been said a million times before, but I really do feel happiest and healthiest when everything is balanced – food, alcohol, social life and exercise. But when the clock strikes midnight tonight I’ll be treating myself to a bev.I’m very much looking forward to this 1 February. I will probably peak too soon and be in bed by nine o’clock. I think the main thing I’ll take away from this experience is that I think a little bit too much about alcohol, and more than I thought I did, and actually I don’t really need it. I think we all get our wants and our needs a little bit mixed up at times.Have you done dry January? How have you got on? Let us know in the comments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41f18d81c0b41c0af711f7da8e95be74ed612443/96_87_4618_2772/master/4618.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=300a61413a590247d5c7851726159a19","title":"andy farrell ireland six nations new look scotland rugby union","story":"The more things change … there is more than the whiff of a fresh breeze whistling through Dublin this weekend, however familiar the bite of wind on our faces at the Aviva Stadium, but no one should expect too great a deviance from the usual narrative when Ireland entertain Scotland.Andy Farrell begins his tenure as Ireland head coach, stepping up one rung with the departure of Joe Schmidt after the latter’s reign of unparalleled success, touching the heights, albeit briefly, of the top of World Rugby’s ranking system. Some might argue that Ireland’s ongoing failure to solve the problem of a World Cup makes pressing the need for change, but history suggests these long-term projects involve lengthy acclimatisation to each and every level attained.Ireland are now comfortable with the idea of dominating a Six Nations. As part of the previous regime, Farrell is likely to see his as a project of development rather than of transformation. Scotland ought to know what to expect – an all-out assault of power and accuracy that will require them to tackle even more than usual in this brutal era of rugby history.It is an assignment they have rarely enjoyed. Scotland have beaten Ireland only four times in the 20 editions of the Six Nations to date, just the once in Dublin – and that at Croke Park in 2010. The last time they won on the current site was at the old Lansdowne Road in 1998.Analogous to their more quicksilver approach, Scotland have made 10 changes to the team that last played Ireland, a concerning capitulation in the World Cup in September (Ireland have made two). The most quicksilver of all of them is absent, Finn Russell apparently enduring one of those “troubled” periods most geniuses encounter at some point or another.Whether his replacement, Adam Hastings, will dramatically affect Scotland’s approach is unlikely. They remain a side heavily invested in speed and ambition. And, whether they like it or not, they will need to appreciate the virtues of a good old-fashioned tackle.No one makes teams tackle like the Irish. The tackle count in the match between Leinster and Connacht at the start of the year exceeded 500 for the first time, breaking the previous record of 496 in the match between Leinster and Glasgow last season, in which Glasgow made 331 tackles, 43 of them by the ever-willing Johnny Gray. In the Six Nations, seven of the top-10 team tackle counts have been registered against Ireland, including all of the top six.There seems no reason to expect this pattern to change appreciably, even if the captaincy of Ireland has changed too, from the workhorse to the eventer, Rory Best to Johnny Sexton. Scotland also have a new captain, the racehorse Stuart Hogg. There is absolutely no reason to think they will change their approach, however many new faces they are throwing at a problem that has confounded them so often.One point of common ground between the two sides is a debutant at No 8. Nick Haining’s route to the base of Scotland’s scrum has been the more unconventional. Cut from the Western Force academy, the 29-year-old headed over to Jersey for three years, where he attracted the interest of Bristol in the Championship. After a season in the Premiership, Richard Cockerill recruited him to Edinburgh, where he has shared duties with the formidable Viliame Mata. His Dundonian grandmother provides the link with Scotland.The theory is that his 18 stones of athleticism might provide Scotland with some ballast against the onslaught. He can also run, having played 20 minutes on the wing for the Force during the 2013 Lions tour, and has the footwork and skills one might expect from the ballet dancer he once was, back in Australia.Opposite him this weekend is Caelan Doris, the latest sensation from the Leinster academy. A mere 21 years old, he has moved through the ranks like a pedigree, adapting to each level as if it were little more than his destiny. Now he has reached that of the Six Nations. He will hope to make it his with no more of a to-do than any of the other levels and, like Ireland, start to explore those few remaining higher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc83e6008f6b6cd9988ca0ac11f70f10d2ca405a/0_37_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51cecf2ef6e4af0b4296d4632e63eefc","title":"england france womens six nations","story":"This year’s women’s Six Nations begins with the fixture most observers believe will be its defining encounter. France take on England in Pau on Sunday, with the hosts standing between the Red Roses and back-to-back grand slams.England beat France on three occasions in 2019 but the head coach, Simon Middleton, is taking no chances and has named his strongest side for the match at the Stade du Hameau.“We are all looking forward to another meeting with France”, Middleton said. “As in the autumn and in all of our most recent contests, games between the two sides are always tight, cagey affairs and we don’t expect this one to be any different.“France were terrific in the autumn, and a 1-1 outcome would have been pretty fair. Although they tended to dominate possession and position we were tactically very good with ball and very clinical in the right areas of field.“They came back against us at Exeter and had tricks up their sleeve they played into space behind us with their kicking game, they challenged us in the middle of the ruck, they asked a lot of questions. I can see they’ve mixed their half-backs up again for this match, so Sunday will be incredibly tactical.”Sarah Hunter will captain the team from No 8, earning her 119th cap. The Loughborough Lightning player will be surrounded by experienced colleagues too, with the England XV averaging 43 caps each. The depth and strength of the squad means Sarah Bern, nominated for last year’s World Rugby Women’s Player of the Year award, is only among the replacements.Middleton claims the current squad has been selected with the upcoming World Cup in mind. Each player in the 23 has made themselves available for selection first for qualifiers later this year and then, should that go to plan for the former champions, the tournament in New Zealand next year.“We’re really comfortable that everyone in the programme believes they’ve got another World Cup in them,” Middleton said. “Some of the more senior players – Hunter, Katy Daley McLean – we’re really confident they will go to the World Cup if they are still fit.“From that point of view we’ve got a squad with a common goal. What we’ve got to do now is get that squad to the World Cup in the best physical shape and well equipped to play our best game. Most critically we’ve got to make sure we’ve got adequate strength in depth, so if we lose players we’re confident that the replacements can play at level we want to, and can lead the team, become influential decision makers.”To that end Middleton has developed a leadership group within the squad, not always composed of the most experienced players, who are trusted with developing both the messaging within the squad and match tactics. The system chosen against France, for example, will be one refined by the players themselves in the final training session on Saturday.“Everyone is a doer but some have to make decisions more than others”, Middleton said. “We’ve done a lot of work in developing the leadership group. It’s easy to assume with the experience in the squad that there is a lot of it and, yes, it’s true, in their own way. But the way we want to lead is going to take some development. We want to make sure the breadth is there and then that filters down.“We want a first in command with generals around. It’s also about ensuring that leaders can share knowledge on the field. Leading through knowledge and leading through inspiration. It’s really interesting to do and something the girls are really keen on.” The next test of this strategy and the Red Roses is on Sunday. In the weekend’s other fixtures, Ireland take on Scotland at Donnybrook while dark horses Italy travel to Cardiff Arms Park to face Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f2e6f6cb6c2db9c3badf2560572994009211ed/0_86_4708_2824/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d51b65eb44e8c6bf0d9e89cc305b887d","title":"england spring surprise george furbank full back six nations opener rugby union","story":"Eddie Jones has warned France to expect violence in England’s Six Nations opener on Sunday, doubling down on his pledge to unleash “absolute brutality” on Fabien Galthié’s bright young things in Paris.Jones’s comments have been greeted with shock in France but the England head coach was adamant his side would look to physically dominate their hosts. Jones highlighted South Africa’s aggression in last November’s World Cup final as key to their success and in England’s first match since that defeat he has pledged to teach Galthié’s side a lesson.“The game is violent isn’t it,” said Jones. “You make a choice to play the game. It’s a brutal, physically aggressive game. We saw in the World Cup final how important aggression is. It’s going to be the same on Sunday. I apologise if it’s been interpreted in the wrong way.“France can expect absolute brutality from England, we are going to go out there to make sure they understand what Test rugby is. It is about being brutal, it is about being physical and it is about dominating the set piece.”Jones has handed a debut to Northampton’s full-back George Furbank, who comes into the side after Anthony Watson was a late withdrawal with a calf injury. Charlie Ewels has been selected alongside Maro Itoje in the second row while Joe Marler starts at loosehead prop with Mako Vunipola a notable absentee from the matchday squad. In total however, Jones has selected 12 of the side who started the World Cup final and conceded that while England begin a new four-year cycle, the scars of the defeat by the Springboks will never heal.“We will have that scar for the rest of our lives,” added Jones. “It never goes away. But it’s how you deal with the scar. If you buy good moisturiser, you can lessen the scar. If you don’t put moisturiser on it the scar stays there. Our scar is healing, but it will always be there.“Going forward we want to play rugby that stops the nation. When we play we want the nation to stop because we want to play with such a ferocious spirit that the opposition don’t know where to go.”Furbank is the beneficiary of Watson’s withdrawal but his first cap is reward for a fine season with Northampton under the tutelage of the New Zealander Chris Boyd. His selection also appears to signal an end to Elliot Daly’s role at full-back with the Saracen now switching to the wing but Jones has no qualms giving Furbank his Test bow at the Stade de France, where England have lost on two of their last three visits.“George is just a good rugby player. He reads the game well, he’s decisive, has good core skills and runs good lines. He’s a very impressive young fella. He handles the pressure of games, handles the pressure of training. Nothing seems to faze him too much.“He’s just one of those footballers that you don’t need to coach a lot. He just naturally knows how to play. He’s got great positional sense. A lot of players coming through now play to a particular pattern, whereas he plays to the position of the ball. He senses where the ball is going to be.”Vunipola was forced to miss Wednesday’s training session with an eye problem but Jones was adamant he was available for selection, though being rested with a view to next week’s trip to Scotland.His brother Billy is also sidelined with Tom Curry switching to No 8 but Jones believes England can cope without both Vunipolas. “We want the pack to be self-sufficient,” he said. “We have played without Billy for long periods of time and we have been OK managing without him previously.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27553f18efd9a4c86ce2f47400d97e50d5a2ba21/0_0_3854_2312/master/3854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56777a7c8ef5143432c00a22a936efe1","title":"garbine muguruza power australian open final against sofia kenin","story":"Conchita Martínez has had cause to jump out of her seat a few times over the past fortnight as Garbiñe Muguruza has swung through every shade of inconsistency and brilliance to reach Saturday’s final against the young American, Sofia Kenin.Martínez, who won Wimbledon in 1994 by beating Martina Navratilova, and reached the final here four years later, has joined her Spanish compatriot full-time this year after guiding her to the Wimbledon title three years ago, and has been in turn delighted and occasionally exasperated, showing her emotions from the players’ box in a string of tight rallies, especially in the semi-final against the world No 3 Simona Halep.Muguruza, who arrived without a seeding and nursing the remnants of a virus, did not figure in any pre-tournament discussions and worked her way through the draw almost unnoticed until she engaged Halep in a semi-final of non-stop screaming and muscular exchanges in the semi-finals, beating the former world No 1 7-6 (8), 7-5.Where Muguruza foiled Halep – who was in magnificent form – was to get inside the court and pin her deep. She will probably have to do the same to Kenin, who plays with similar attacking intent, but is vulnerable on her second serve.Muguruza has expressed herself freely on court on her way to the final, and Martinez likes to see that.“She’s winning a lot of good points. Even against Halep, the points were getting long and she had enough patience to be aggressive again and finish the point. Of course, if you’re winning some of those tough points, you’re going … I don’t know how you say in English – you’re going to celebrate.”Kenin, who has always shown promise as a junior, is blossoming now at 21, but is still getting used to on-court interviews and the barrage of questions that come with relatively instant success. The world No 15 has a game that is ready to be tested, but she does not want to give too much away to an opponent who has won two majors.But after beating the world No 1 Ashleigh Barty in the first semi-final, she was unusually empathetic, realising she had destroyed the hopes of the Australian’s growing army of fans: “First, I’d like to apologise to all of the Australian fans. I know they wanted her to win. It’s not easy for them. But I beat the world No 1, and I’m so grateful and so happy. She played such a great match. She’s a really great player.”But Kenin – who will become the youngest American woman in the top 10 for 21 years – was greater on the day. She kept a scarily solid focus from first point to last, as did Barty, and clearly is not daunted by the prospect of winning a slam, which would change her life just as it has Naomi Osaka and Barty.“But I’m not shocked,” Kenin said. “It’s a dream come true for me. I’ve always dreamed about this all my life. Of course, I believed in myself.”Kenin – the youngest singles finalist here since Maria Sharapova beat Ana Ivanovic in 2008 – will have to be at her best against Muguruza, who has broken her opponent’s serve at least four times in every match here this year.There is a sense – given substance with another impressive run by Coco Gauff until she lost to Kenin in the fourth round – that youth, or at least new faces, are bursting through at the top of the women’s game. Seven of the past 11 slam winners have been first-timers: Bianca Andreescu, Barty, Osaka, Halep, Caroline Wozniacki, Sloane Stephens and Jelena Ostapenko.For all her promise and grit, Kenin might find that Muruguza – every bit as determined as she is – has too many well-drilled weapons for her on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cabb1ed23b167928409db89824543d19bdb4725a/0_256_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab101a885ca6cd9b2a68d534528e67d6","title":"move gluasad julia taudevin celtic connections","story":"Uig Community Centre, Isle of LewisJulia Taudevin’s show about the Gaelic tradition of singing for the dead takes us on a dizzying spin through space and timeIt’s based on keening rituals, the ancient Gaelic tradition of singing for the dead, but Julia Taudevin’s Move~Gluasad is driven less by grief than by the pulse of life. Where many shows about mourning become inert, trapped by an emotion that has no release, this one seems to see death as part of a cycle, both end point and new beginning sad, horrific, terrifying, yes, but also as inevitable as the ebb and flow of the sea.The luminous moons cradled by the five performers seem to set the show’s tidal rhythm. It’s as if their gravitational pull is governing the women’s gorgeous singing, which belongs in some otherworldly place of raw emotion, just as it does the fluid form of Taudevin’s script.In this debut production for Disaster Plan, the company she set up with partner Kieran Hurley, the playwright draws us into a whirlpool of global connections. It begins here on the Isle of Lewis, where a woman prepares to scatter the ashes she has kept in an ironically named bag for life. From there, it takes a dizzying spin through space and time: to the streets of Glasgow where a Colombian exile mourns the grandson she lost at sea, to western Sudan where a UN worker witnesses a bloodbath, to Australia where a Gaelic speaker’s final words are not understood, and to a Greek island where a rescued baby represents the possibility of renewal.Performed in the round, the play washes about us like the incoming tide. Taudevin, who co-directs with Caitlin Skinner, is joined on stage by Mairi Morrison, Nerea Bello, Maryam Hamidi and Neshla Caplan, protagonists one minute, chorus the next. Morphing from Gaelic to gospel, the music recognises the pain, the guilt and the helplessness of death, even as it seeks to purge those emotions.On a tour of village halls before its appearance in Glasgow’s Celtic Connections, it is a production at once rooted and outward looking, unsentimental and sincere, with a sound, if not to die for, then at the very least to be reborn to.Touring until 2 February.

By  Dayna TortoriciI had reached the point of diminishing returns. I wanted to quit Twitter, but my fingers were as if possessed, typing command+n, tw, enter at any lull in the workday, letting autofill take care of the rest. Like an old woman who finds herself at a familiar bus stop in her nightgown, I would blink at the new window and wonder how I got there and where I had intended to go. More than once I asked a friend to change my password and lock me out of my account. Weeks would go by without incident, sometimes months, but then a protest would break out, or my hometown would be on fire, and the old media was too slow with the news. I would go through the password retrieval process, log on, catch up, lose my mind and repeat the process.Finally, in July 2018, I thought: I’m going to have a heart attack if I stay on here.I changed my password to thisisamassivewasteoftimeandnotthepurposeofyourlifeonearth.I told a friend that I was banishing myself to Instagram, the only social media platform that did not haunt me, get under my skin and cause me to feel shortness of breath and numbness in my fingers. I had a theory that everyone was haunted by at least one of them, and which one depended on your insecurities, the type of people who gathered there, and the style of communication its interface allowed.I surveyed new acquaintances: “When you think: ‘Social media is terrible,’ which are you thinking of most?” For some the answer was Facebook – people with serious exes, political ambitions, a Trump-supporting family or high school rivals. For me, and for others overwhelmed by the hyper-acceleration of news commentary, it was Twitter.Instagram felt innocent by comparison. No one I knew cared about it or made a living on it. The people who confessed a troubled relationship with the platform were visual artists, which I was not fearful of missing out, which was not my flavour of social anxiety or influencers concerned with a standard of perfection that was not my standard, and so I felt immune. For the most part, Instagram people preached positivity and contentment, and reminded themselves and their followers that the aesthetic harmony attainable in images was fleeting, not sustainable as a way of life. Instagram people did not seem mean or clever. They were earnest and sincere. They drank green smoothies and went on hikes, sought personal bests, good health, peace of mind and oneness with the universe. They believed every day was a beautiful day to be alive. Leaving Twitter for Instagram was like moving to Los Angeles, only cheaper. I knew people who had gone west to convalesce and to retire from public life. Maybe Instagram would be like that for me?By this time I had already been on Instagram for six years – long enough to have developed misgivings about it – but the platform was such a reprieve from the moment’s psychic turmoil that I didn’t dwell on them. To do so would be like spending your holiday researching the detrimental effects of tourism: a wise, just and morally superior choice, but objectively not the point.If I was operating under a willful innocence, it helped that I had started in 2012 with a rule: only follow people you know. Even back then, I felt as if I was being hosed daily with unwanted opinions, ideas, emotions and headlines on Facebook and Twitter, and the idea that I could start afresh with a limited intake made me feel safe. My Instagram account was not private – anyone could follow me – but I kept a tight door on my feed. There was no share, retweet or reblog feature on Instagram people would have to go out of their way to show me things by people I didn’t follow, and most didn’t bother. The network was limited. Nothing I didn’t want to see would appear in the timeline. The environment was still and sane.How did I choose what to post? If I was walking down the street in company and stopped to say: “Sorry, I just have to take a picture of this,” usually that was sufficient. A random, inchoate force was at work – the snap reflex of humour or taste.Posting was its own separate pleasure. I would eventually come to post for attention, like everyone else – but early on, when nobody liked my pictures, I still found it gratifying to post. The satisfaction of self-publishing is difficult to describe. To press a button and see your own excrescence appear in the preordained format, minted, can feel like a kind of magic. It can make you feel like you count. But what people saw from me was less important to my mental health than what I saw of them. Hence the rule to only follow people I knew. For two years, that was a clean, easy test. But in time, I began to relax my definition of an acquaintance. Soon I was looking at a lot of people I had never met and never intended to.Genres of Instagram I came to recognise after this door opened were: archival photography, astrology meme, travel photography, cookingbaking, fitnessexercise, political meme, celebrity superfan, street fashion, makeupdrag, time-lapse photography, architecturedesign, tactile or “satisfying”, cross-platform meme (eg, screenshots from Twitter), female influencer, historical, inspirational, animal rescue, literary, home decor, viral dance, gymnasticacrobatic, ceramic, houseplant care, illustration and softcore pornography.Some trends were easier to decipher than others. For a period of six months, I noticed a number of Americans visiting Portugal and posting pictures of painted tiles. Why did the tiles look so good there? I overthought it for a while and then realised Instagram was already tiles. Why all the houseplants? Because we spend too much time indoors and they photograph well.Each night I lay in my bed beside my boyfriend with one eye closed against the pillow and with the other, wheeled down Instagram’s infinite scroll. Each morning, I woke up to my phone alarm and rolled over to tap it off and, if I had time, looked at Instagram while still half-asleep. I easily spent an hour on it a day – in bed, on the subway or at my desk during lunch. Compared with the hours I spent elsewhere on the internet, it felt like nothing.“What does the egg mean?”World records are meaningless in a culture defined by historical amnesia and the relentless invention of categories, I thought, and double tapped to like the egg.The closest I came to experiencing an Instagram subculture was through following fitness accounts between 2016 and 2018. I was in my late 20s and had rediscovered a passion for exercise. I belonged to a gym but needed things to do, something better than running or cycling. Instagram was a fount of ideas. It was there that I discovered a world of people, mostly women, who worked out all day and were paid in tights and crop tops by athleisure brands to do so.From time to time they cracked. “I look nice and smug in this photo,” said a popular woman powerlifter I liked, “but I’m considering making a YouTube video about my recent nervous breakdownidentity crisis.” Through her, I learned about the mechanics of Facetune, a photo-editing app that allows you to smooth cellulite, shrink waistlines, whiten sclera and disappear acne with little technical skill. I knew about the app from trans women I followed who used it to soften jawlines and erase Adam’s apples, a sort of spot-treatment for dysphoria that brought their likeness closer to the ideal. Their offhand references to Facetune suggested that image manipulation wasn’t empowerment, just something you could control when your health insurance didn’t cover facial feminisation surgery. The athletes, less forthright about their body-image issues, were cagier about their usage.In the powerlifter’s video about Facetune, she said she felt hypocritical for editing her photos while championing body acceptance and strength-building for women. If she couldn’t walk the walk, at least she would talk about it. She was not the only one. Such confessional double-consciousness was everywhere on #fitstagram. Women posted before-and-after photos 60 seconds apart to demonstrate the powerful effects of posing. Before: a slumping, bloated person with her tailbone tucked. After: a composed physique model with a popped heel and a perfect ass. But no matter how much consciousness-raising they did, they were still under the spell of the image and strove to live up to it.I wish I could say I watched this all from a cool, critical distance. In truth, I spent too much time at the gym and worried about my forward head position – an affliction common to people who spend too much time on their phones. My Explore page, which drives users via algorithm toward content similar to what they’ve seen or liked, became a mosaic of increasingly extreme exercisers. Looking at competitive bodybuilders, I caught myself thinking they didn’t look all that weird. This is how dysmorphia works, I thought the algorithm only encourages it, nudging you towards extremity. And yet it cut both ways: the more body-positive accounts I looked at as a counterweight, the more the Explore page fed me body-positive imagery. All images train the eye, and consistent exposure to fat bodies rewires the brain just as much as consistent exposure to thin ones. It brought to mind a moment in Pumping Iron, the 70s bodybuilding documentary, in which a young Arnold Schwarzenegger attempts to explain the mindset of the subculture.“I mean, obviously a lot of people look at you and they think it’s kind of strange, what you’re doing,” he says. “But those are the people who don’t know much about it ... As soon as you find out what the whole thing is about, then it’s just like another thing.”Everything on Instagram was like that. Once you found out about it, it was just another thing.We think we know, but do we really know the full extent of manipulation on this platform, the psychological complexity and the degree of social engineering involved? Yes and no. As of this writing, Instagram has an estimated value of more than $100bn (£77bn), 100 times what Facebook bought it for in 2012. It is a data-collection business and a media-selling business. Third-party indexing tools glean data from what is posted and sell it in the form of brand analytics – or as information for governments, security and surveillance firms, and corporations. Images posted to Instagram are used by Facebook to help train its proprietary image-recognition software. And, of course, Facebook-owned Instagram tracks your movements across the internet, and hints that it is stalking you in ways both subtle and not.Occasionally someone or something lifts the veil. In July 2019, Instagram crashed, and for a brief period users had the unusual experience of scrolling through their feeds and seeing, in the place of images, image-recognition metadata as blue text in pale gray squares. The text read:“Image may contain: night, sky and outdoor”“Image may contain: 1 or more people, people sitting, shoes and indoor”I imagined sentient robots thumbing through photos. This is how they would see us: in Terminator vision.When Instagram introduced advertisements in 2013, it suddenly seemed as if every fifth image in my feed was an ad. Then I counted – every third or fourth post was an ad. With time, they grew uncannily specific. An ad for a bar cart from a furniture startup, on which stood a selection of magazines, including n+1 – the magazine I work for – next to a speckled philodendron. An ad for a minimalist women’s clothing brand based in San Francisco, modelled by the younger sister of a poet I had recently met. I was being reached by Facebook Ads Manager through detailed targeting, which I knew existed: users who like Bon Appétit, live in Brooklyn, between the ages of 18 and 35, should see this ad. But this was being stalked on another level. By the end of 2019, I half expected to see my own likeness in an ad served just to me – me in minimalist clothing, reading n+1, beside a bar cart.What were other people seeing? I realised I had no idea. Whereas I once watched TV ads with interest – especially those geared toward men during the American football games my boyfriend watched, the car commercials and beer commercials and pharmaceutical commercials for hair loss and erectile dysfunction – on Instagram I saw only myself. It was easier to see ideology at work on other people, and at least those TV ads gave me a sense of what strings of the American male psyche advertisers were choosing to pull. Now, I was alone with my ads, in a filter bubble of one.Meanwhile, Instagram was leaving its trace on the physical world. People in search of ’grammable content were mobbing restaurants, public lands and private neighbourhoods in greater numbers, causing their stewards to think differently about design and crowd control. I read an article about Rue Crémieux in Paris, where residents of pastel-painted houses were begging for a gate so tourists would stop taking photos in front of them. “It’s become hell,” the vice-president of the street association told a local news website. “On weekends, we get 200 people outside our windows. Our dinner table is right by the window and people are just outside taking pictures.”An article on NPR suggested Instagram was driving more visitors to national parks in pursuit of the perfect image. In 2018, the article reported: “A California woman fell to her death at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan while trying to take a selfie.” At Yellowstone in 2015, a woman “was gored by a bison while attempting to get a selfie with the animal”. Park officials created a voluntary pledge for visitors that included the phrase: “No picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park.”Land preservation was also a concern. An anonymous curmudgeon started the Instagram account @publiclandshateyou to shame Instagram tourists for their thoughtless treatment of nature reserves and wilderness areas. In spring 2019, Miley Cyrus posted a photo of herself hanging from aJoshua tree, an endangered plant known for its delicate root system. The Mojave Desert Land Trust begged her to take it down.By then it was obvious that Instagram was changing the built environment, too. Cafes, bars and themed fun houses called “museums” were being constructed and designed to appear on the grid. Art museums realised that programming exhibitions with built-in selfie opportunities increased “user-generated content”, or UGC, which, in turn, led to free, “organic” promotion.New storefronts and restaurants were likewise optimised for the image. Considerations such as comfort, accessibility and acoustics were secondary to visual appeal. It was as if the landscape itself had dysmorphia, altering its physical appearance to fit an arbitrary standard that undermined its primary function. But maybe I had it backwards. Maybe the point of a physical space was no longer to shelter physical people. Maybe a shopfront was a marketing tool for a direct-to-consumer internet startup, the way a website was once a marketing tool for a bricks-and-mortar outlet. Glossier. Everlane. Warby Parker. The Sill. Walking into such places felt like walking into an app. They always looked smaller in person, like famous actors who are shorter in real life.By the autumn of 2019, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. If I was getting depressed, so was everyone else. The algorithm’s hall-of-mirrors effect seemed to be at work again: more and more people were posting about staying in, struggling with their mental health and finding a community of fellow sufferers on the platform. But it wasn’t just me and my algorithm. Other people were growing disenchanted and reclusive, and the media seemed to confirm the trend. Tavi Gevinson, the American writer and the co-founder of Rookie, published a New York magazine cover story chronicling her ambivalence about growing up on Instagram. The Atlantic claimed The New Instagram It Girl Spends All Her Time Alone and described how influencers were staging more selfies at home to appear relatable to their followers. Home-delivery services, loungewear brands and weighted-blanket manufacturers were all well poised to capitalise.Then I encountered the Agoraphobic Traveller. At a live storytelling event I attended, the MC cued the lights for a message from the sponsor. The stage lights dimmed and a four-minute video told the story of Jacqui, a fortysomething woman with a thick New Zealand accent who had started having severe panic attacks in her 20s. “Eventually I was diagnosed with agoraphobia,” she said in voiceover as the camera caught her face through a windowpane. For a while, she struggled to travel far from home. “It’s not living life. It’s not a life, when you’re just constantly not in a good place.”Then she hit a turning point. Jacqui was looking at Google Street View one day when she thought to take screenshots of vistas or tableaux she liked. “I’ve always loved photography,” she said. “This gave me the opportunity to be a photographer but without having that anxious feeling. I think that I’ve taken around 27,000 screenshots,” she told the camera.Jacqui created an Instagram account, @streetview.portraits, to share the screenshots she took. In the video, the camera showed Jacqui looking at one of her Instagram posts, a washed-out image of two camels in the desert, scrolling over the comments. “Now I feel more connected to the world than I ever have before,” she said.With help from Google, Jacqui travelled to New York for an exhibition of her photos in Soho called The Agoraphobic Traveller. The video showed Jacqui in a cab, Jacqui on the plane. The camera trailed her arriving at the gallery, her shoulders hiked and hands in her pockets. Inside, she smiled and relaxed. “If you’re struggling and you’re keeping it to yourself ... it definitely doesn’t help,” she said. “Please don’t give up, know that it can get better and it does get better.”I was happy for Jacqui, but the video disturbed me deeply. I found it pernicious and thought about it for days. The message was benign – technology connects you to the world. But I couldn’t shake the subtext: that if Google and Instagram had an ideal user, it might be a creative person who could not – would not – leave her home.Modern voyeurism has precedents, even the multiple-window kind. In Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window, LB “Jeff” Jefferies is a housebound magazine photographer laid up with a broken leg and “nothing to do but look out the window”. Across the courtyard is a dollhouse of parallel lives that he can watch unfold from his wheelchair. There’s the blond “bikini bombshell” – “Miss Torso”, he calls her – who stretches and twirls in her underwear while she butters her breakfast toast Mr Thorwald, the costume jewellery salesman, who tends a flower garden and a sick, unhappy wife “Miss Lonelyhearts,” a single woman who pantomimes a candlelit dinner for two before she drinks and cries herself to sleep and other nameless neighbours who are less intriguing but still worth watching.The view from Jeff’s rear window calls to mind Henry James’s “house of fiction”, which “has not one window but a million”. It also recalls the view from Instagram. As Durga Chew-Bose writes in an essay on the film: “Jeff sits and stares out his window like we sit and scroll, and double tap.” He spins stories about his neighbours, like we do “about strangers ... based on their Instagram accounts.” The ethical implications were fraught then as now. “We’ve become a race of Peeping Toms,” says Stella, the insurance company nurse who checks in on Jeff and admonishes him. “What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes, sir. How’s that for a bit of homespun philosophy?”The entangled dynamics of who sees whom and who knows they’re being seen have always been present. Where Instagram seems truly new – beyond the introduction of machine learning and commercial surveillance to the mix – is in the strange instability of the viewer’s position as a subject. A voyeur knows what kind of viewer he is, but looking at Instagram, you are not always a voyeur. Neither are you always a witness, nor any other single kind of watcher. Your implied identity slips with each stroke of the thumb.If you are me, scrolling through Instagram, you are the confidant being whispered to by a face shot from under the chin. You are the recipient of a holiday card from a family in matching turtlenecks. You are the magazine subscriber flipping through editorials. You are the woman standing in front of the screen miming the aerobic movements of your instructor. You are the mother, adult height, looking down at her child. You are the lunch companion peering across the table. You are the customer browsing for deals. You are the scholar sifting through archives. You are the fan admiring Beyoncé. You are the mirror, reflecting the image of the photographer. You are the photographer, seeing through her eyes. You are the phone.Or you are the voyeur at the window, trying to get a closer look – in which case the villain who enters your private space, not through the window, but through the front door, is the ads.A week into writing this essay, I began to see ads about it on Instagram. The bar cart came back, this time with different magazines on the shelf. So did the “life-transforming, plant-rich super meals delivered to your door”, a remnant from my fitness moment, and the forward-head-position posture corrector, a piece of plastic you stick to your spine that buzzes whenever you slouch. I was served an ad for a New York Times article about facial-recognition technology, and an ad for the Wall Street Journal featuring an illustration of a teen girl in bed looking despondent in bed a phone on the bedside table showed two girls smiling and surrounded by hearts. The caption read: “Young Americans have become unwitting guinea pigs in today’s huge, unplanned experiment with social media, and teenage girls are bearing much of the brunt.”The US government has been slow to respond to the scope of this experiment. The EU has been more aggressive. In response to pressure from regulators, Facebook is now more transparent about data. For the first time, I can see the names of companies who have uploaded my information to the platform: Predictive Media Analytics LLC, Nielsen, LiveRamp, Acxiom, Adara, Oracle Data Cloud, Wunderman Data Products, SocialCode, TowerData. The company has also given users some measure of control over ad settings.Following the directions in an article I found online, I switched Ads based on data from other partners – meaning data about websites I had visited or purchases I had made on my credit card – to Not allowed. I switched Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere, which I didn’t understand, to Not allowed. I switched Ads that include your social actions, meaning ads telling friends I liked certain products, to be shown to No One. Overnight, my Instagram ads became delightfully random.But my life as a generic nontarget, a recipient of ads for Amazon influencers, corny T-shirts and trashy iPhone games, was short lived. I simply spent too much time on Instagram for it not to relearn what it knew before I wiped the slate. I wish I could wipe it again.The speed of machine learning is startling, often creepy. It is hard to tell what is creepier: the feeling that someone is somewhere out there, following your every step, or the fact that no one is, just the tracking device you carry with you in your pocket. I still give Instagram an hour a day, for the intermittent pleasure it brings. A built-in timer reminds me when my time is up.Late at night in bed, I get an ad for a meditation app meant to aid with sleep. It’s midnight and I’m browsing Instagram stories.Addicted to Instagram? says the ad.Below is a poll with two options: Yes and How’d you know.• This is an edited version of a longer article originally published by nplusonemag• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1226a36936f8c7511b12a522c88b66c866141ad/0_0_5242_3147/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ebbe5477d8167d9ddc0e4e0c06fdf69","title":"bernie sanders democrats poll standing iowa moderates","story":"Centrists criticize Sanders as a ‘uniquely’ flawed candidate – but polls show him ahead in Iowa and tied with Biden nationallyDays before Democrats begin voting for a nominee to take on Donald Trump, panic is beginning to spread in some corners of the party that their standard-bearer could be a 78-year-old democratic socialist from Vermont.As Bernie Sanders shows signs of strength ahead of Monday’s Iowa caucuses, anxious Democrats fear a repeat of 2016, when establishment Republicans failed to grasp Trump’s strength before it was too late.They argue that Sanders would be a “uniquely” flawed and woefully “untested” nominee and easily crushed by what will certainly be a well-financed negative assault.“There is a deep treasure trove of stuff from Bernie’s background – all of the radical things he’s said and done over the years – that the Trump campaign could circulate,” said Matt Bennett, the executive vice-president for public affairs at Third Way, a center-left thinktank. “He is without question the candidate Trump hopes to have as an opponent in November.”Bennett is among an increasingly vocal group of Democrats who believe nominating Sanders is not only a risk but a potentially “historic mistake”.In a memo sent to influential Iowa Democrats, Third Way warned that Sanders’ “politically toxic background” and “far-left positions” would repel moderate and independent voters who are critical to Trump’s re-election.That sentiment was amplified this week by a series of columns and editorials and by the Democratic Majority for Israel, a group of pro-Israel Democrats that is spending nearly $700,000 to air a television ad in Iowa ahead of the caucuses that raises doubts about Sanders’ electability – and physical fitness.“I like Bernie, I think he has great ideas,” Michael Kuehner, an Iowa voter, says in the ad. “But Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa? They’re just not going to vote for a socialist.” Another voter, Darby Holroyd, says: “I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders’ health, considering the fact that he did have a heart attack.”Joe Biden has remained durable atop the Democratic field and maintains a clear path to the nomination. But recent surveys show Sanders leading in Iowa and far ahead in New Hampshire. On Friday, a NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll found Biden and Sanders in a dead heat at the top of the Democratic field.The urgency of the centrists’ warnings against Sanders reflects a realization he could actually win the Democratic nomination.“There’s a lot of history to suggest that if he wins those two states, he becomes very hard to stop,” said Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster and the president of Democratic Majority for Israel.After a summer of slumping poll numbers and a heart attack in October, few expected Sanders to rebound. Establishment-minded Democrats instead trained their fire on his progressive rival, Elizabeth Warren, attacking her economic vision and hammering her on the details of her healthcare plan. The effect was to turn the candidate with the most loyal supporters and largest fundraising operation into an underdog – allowing him to run as an anti-establishment insurgent rather than a frontrunner.“Suddenly, we have the Democratic establishment very nervous about this campaign,” Sanders roared at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa, last weekend. “They’re starting to think: could this really happen?“We are their worst nightmare,” he said, to deafening applause.The Democrats behind the recent moves to dim Sanders’ rise insist there is no coordinated “stop Sanders” effort, and few believe such a movement would work. Instead, these worried Democrats say their goal is to highlight Sanders’ vulnerabilities for a small but significant slice of undecided primary voters who are open to his message but not entrenched in his “political revolution”.However, few Democrats are joining their public call to arms, partly out of fear that any indication of an organized anti-Sanders campaign would antagonize his loyal army of supporters, who are already deeply suspicious of the party establishment. Others believe such efforts only serve to hand Sanders a political gift.Sanders raised $1.3m after a fundraising appeal asking supporters to fight back against attacks by “outside groups”. On Thursday, a coalition of nine outside groups backing Sanders said they would join forces to build what they called the “largest independent mobilizing commitment” in 2020.Mellman said he recognized the risks of inflaming Sanders supporters, but believes remaining silent “would be worse”.“Democrats say defeating Trump is what’s most important to them,” he said. “We think Sanders is very poorly positioned to do that.”At a town hall in Decorah, Iowa, on Thursday morning, Pete Buttigieg lamented that Sanders adheres to “a kind of politics that says you’ve got to go all the way here and nothing else counts”.Later that day, at a campaign stop in Pella, Iowa, Biden was unusually blunt when asked to draw a contrast with Sanders: “I’m a Democrat.”Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, has signed a loyalty pledge to serve as a Democrat if elected president. But Biden pressed: “He’s not a registered Democrat, to the best of my knowledge.”John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman and a long-shot presidential candidate, departed the field on Friday with a warning that Democrats embrace the economic populism of Sanders or Warren at their peril.“Their proposal takes healthcare away from a lot of people and forces them on some new government plan,” he said of Sanders and Warren’s support for a government-run healthcare model. “That’s a hard way to win an election.”Sanders could carve a similar path to the nomination as Trump in 2016, by taking advantage of a fractured field with no clear leader. But the 2018 congressional elections delivered mixed results for Sanders’ movement, with little evidence to support his confidence that a populist leftwing agenda will resonate in conservative battlegrounds.“This isn’t an election where you win with huge turnouts in California or Massachusetts or New York,” said Harold Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Firefighters, a prominent union that is rallying support for Biden in Iowa. “People may not like it, but this is an electoral election. To win, you need a nominee that can compete in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa.”That analysis is sharply contested by Sanders supporters, who point out that running a centrist candidate failed to beat Trump in 2016, and that the eventual nominee must be someone who can energize young and disaffected voters to counter the president’s fervent base. Once again, they believe, the political class has underestimated Sanders’ appeal to working people.“The political establishment has ignored working people for so long. They sowed these seeds,” said Hugh Espey, executive director of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, which has endorsed Sanders. “We’re sick and tired of business-as-usual politics. We need to do something different.”Speaking at an event on behalf of Sanders on Wednesday night, the climate activist Naomi Klein cautioned that the attacks were just the beginning.“At every turn, Washington DC elites said Bernie’s position was unrealistic, impossible, not credible,” she intoned. “But over and over again over the past 40 years history has sided with Bernie Sanders.“If he was right about the past,” she concluded, “he is right about the future too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a9c3bb6a00b8afdf6d3303ee21409fcc6f6c27/0_125_6046_3628/master/6046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890ef0288b67c438227d1b731c29dde0","title":"all men for 150 years women take centre stage at royal new zealand ballet","story":"The national ballet troupe will become the first classical company in the world to perform an entire year of works choreographed by womenIt’s an ethereal art form in which dancers, who are overwhelmingly female, strive for unattainable perfection performing works almost always created by men. But in uncompromising world of ballet, where the work of female choreographers is often relegated to one-off showcases while men take the spotlight, a ballet company in New Zealand is making history with a whole year of performances that put women creators centre stage.“For 14 years I’d only ever performed works by men,” says Alice Topp, a ballerina and, in 2018, the second woman ever to hold the post of resident choreographer at the Australian Ballet in its almost 60-year history. Now, she perches on a Swiss ball in the Royal New Zealand Ballet’s light, airy rehearsal studios in Wellington, still sweating from the morning class she has just ducked out of, hair loose around her shoulders.Things have changed in the ballet world – Topp wears sweatpants to class these days, rather than pink leotards, and no longer scrapes her hair back into a tight bun – but not fast enough.“It’s hard when you have to fight for opportunities,” she says. “I want to see a shift happen, and that’s not going to happen from sitting back and talking about it.”In 2020, the Royal New Zealand Ballet will become the first classical company in the world to perform an entire year of works choreographed solely by women – including one by Topp – a move that is, shockingly, radical.“Why not? There’s been all-men years for the past 150 years where only men choreograph,” says Patricia Barker, the company’s artistic director, who has scheduled works by the legendary American choreographer Twyla Tharp and established New Zealand names, along with shows by up-and-coming creators, in the season that begins in February.“I hate that I have to advertise it as an all-women year,” she added. But Barker, who had a history of encouraging women dance creators in her previous post as artistic director of Grand Rapids Ballet in Michigan, wanted to bring awareness to the issue.The change has come in the throes of the #MeToo movement, in which women across many industries – including dance – have spoken up against abuse by powerful men. Tamara Rojo, the artistic director and principal dancer of English National Ballet, made headlines in 2016 when she said that in her 20-year career, she had never performed in a work choreographed by a woman. Women had told her they didn’t think they were capable of creating, she told The Stage in 2013, in comments that generated controversy. “I have never had that reply from a male choreographer,” she added.Dancers at the Royal New Zealand Ballet said the matter was complicated. Because men are rare in children’s ballet classes, they are sought after by professional schools and companies, and Topp says distinctive styles and showmanship are encouraged.“They get, ‘oh what a lad, got a little bit of chutzpah that one, got a bit of attitude,’” she says. Women, on the other hand, make up the corps de ballet of the company - something of a perfect backdrop to the soloists, where each member must move in sync with every other, like a single organism.“Your job is to be identical and you’re not taught to think for yourself,” Topp says. “You’ve nailed it if you blend, if no one notices you. You’re not taught to be a leader.”What was more, women dancers say, the corps de ballet is onstage for the entirety of a classical performance, leaving little space in their schedules, or mentally, for their own creativity. And the consideration of having a family and returning to work afterwards was even tougher on women in ballet than in some other industries, given the physical demands of the job.“To stay at the top of your game is a selfish lifestyle in many ways,” says Barker, adding that companies must accommodate women choreographers who needed to travel with their families - despite straitened economic circumstances that forced directors to “stretch every dollar.”In the first seven years of her career, “I’d never had a chance to work with a female choreographer,” says Mayu Tanigaito, a principal dancer with the Royal New Zealand Ballet. That had only changed two years ago, when Barker had assumed directorship of the company -- she was the first female leader Tanigaito had worked under -- and began to commission works created by women.In a Royal New Zealand Ballet studio on a recent morning, Tanigaito rehearsed Topp’s ballet, Aurum, under the Australian choreographer’s watchful eye. Inspired by the Japanese art of kintsugi, which highlights the broken parts of pottery by repairing them with gold lacquer, Tanigaito and the company’s other dancers moved sinuously in pairs, curving and angling into each other’s space in movements that were languid one moment, quicksilver the next.“It’s not really different because of men or because of women,” Tanigaito said of working with women creators. “But it’s helpful because women understand our physicality.”She added that sometimes men did not entirely comprehend the mechanics of pointe work, where women dancers perform with their entire body weight pressed down on the tips of their toes. But the opportunities came with greater pressure.“When I’m in the studio, gender does not come into it,” Topp says, adding that she is “not male or female but an artist” while working. “On the flip side, there have been times when other male choreographers have said, ‘She’s only getting this opportunity because she’s female, there’s a shortage of female voices, that’s why she’s getting it.’“And I’m like, ‘Do I really have to fight this?’”Barker said it had been common “for the past five, six, eight years” for companies to stage a special programme of works by women in a year of shows created by men. But she had not faced any resistance from those guarding the purse-strings at the Royal New Zealand Ballet to the idea of a full year of women’s work.Topp says being part of the occasion was “like carrying the Olympic torch.”“I had to cross examine myself - do I really have something important to say? Do people really want to listen?” she said, adding that she doubted most men faced the same inner monologue.“Sometimes it takes longer for you to be assertive, to be comfortable in your own voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc753a5cbcab449389d06d1ac063673a7c2b2c/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=33a7f70d2ae955e59fea6cf9e4fb61af","title":"coronavirus us public health emergency travel china","story":"The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. “This is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize the risk to the American public currently is low,” said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, Robert R Redfield, on Friday. “It is our goal to keep it that way.”The new strain of coronavirus has spread rapidly in Hubei province, where nearly 10,000 people have been infected and more than 200 people died.

Americans who have traveled to other parts of mainland China will be subject to home quarantine for 14 days.The restrictions will apply to any foreign nationals not immediately related to Americans or US permanent residents, and come into effect on Sunday at 5pm ET.“There is no travel ban,” said Joel Szabat, the assistant secretary for transportation, in response to a question from a reporter. He noted all three major air carriers had already halted flights to China in response to the epidemic.“We have been seeing already a significant decrease in passengers going between the US and China,” said Szabat.The US move comes a day after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a health emergency of international concern.US authorities will also start funneling all flights from China to seven major airports – in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu – where travelers can be screened.“We understand this action may seem drastic. We would rather be remembered for overreacting than underreacting,” the CDC’s Nancy Messonnier said.Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the measures were necessary because of the “unknowns” regarding the coronavirus.Deputy secretary of state Stephen Biegun said: “I want the Chinese people to know they have the deepest sympathies of the United States of America.”The move is likely to anger Beijing, which earlier on Friday had criticized a travel warning that advised against all travel to China.A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said: “The World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite. It’s truly mean.”The virus causes respiratory illness and pneumonia, for which there is little treatment. Antibiotics are ineffective for the disease because it is viral, rather than bacterial.There are a range of symptoms, from mild to severe, associated with the virus. American officials said they are also concerned because the disease can be spread by people without symptoms.Travel restrictions in the US were enacted as part of a presidential proclamation and declaration of a public health emergency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/903ab67cf1a136dea720e9ee2b0c0ae1c7a11b87/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6716f2ce9b373499d45d656c0609a2","title":"el salvador femicide sentence karla turcios","story":"The boyfriend of a murdered Salvadoran journalist has been found guilty of femicide and given the maximum 50-year prison sentence on Friday, a rare conviction in the deadly gender violence that often goes unpunished in the Central American nation.Mario Huezo was convicted by a judge of killing Karla Turcios, with whom he lived and had a child with, after a nine-day trial in a court that hears gender violence cases in San Salvador.The murder of Turcios in 2018 made headlines and prompted the government to declare a national emergency against femicide – the killing of a woman by a man because of her gender.El Salvador, a country of 6 million people, has one of the world’s highest rates of femicide, according to the United Nations.El Salvador passed a law in 2012 to define and punish femicide as a specific crime with a longer sentence than murder, with prison terms for convicted offenders of 20 to 50 years.The law requires prosecutors to prove the motive for a woman’s murder was hatred or contempt based on gender.Turcios, 33, whose beaten body was found dumped on a roadside, became a household name and symbol of the violence women face in El Salvador that often goes unpunished.A woman in El Salvador was murdered on average every three days in 2019, and prosecutors opened investigations into 148 cases of femicides last year, official figures show.“The conviction sends a message of intolerance toward forms of violence against women,” Silvia Juárez, a women’s rights activist in El Salvador, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It sends a message to the rest of the population.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a6db388324ce07c92892a0e3968ab6c486850f0/0_0_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5a03dacc6bb247b4cf0d3976028a0ff","title":"the city is suffocating diary of the wuhan coronavirus lockdown","story":"A resident describes life in the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreakThursday 23 January (first day of lockdown) At 2am the government says my home town, Wuhan, is soon to be placed under lockdown. All the trains, flights and public transport will be cancelled. People have talked about the virus for a while. The spread of the outbreak is getting worse. I suppose it is the right decision.When I go outdoors I am cautious and mostly stay in the car. There are 11 million people in my city but the streets are empty. We have never seen it like this before. It’s normal for a lot of the stores to be shut during Chinese new year but this is different. I’m lucky to find masks on my second run to a pharmacy. I go to the supermarket but vegetables are sold out.Friday 24 January Today is Chinese new year’s eve. I wake up and a doctor friend tells me that because public transport has been suspended, health workers can’t get to work. Volunteers have begun driving them, and I decide to help.I’m not afraid of being infected: the health workers are professionals and we do not have direct face-to-face contact during the ride. They sit in the back seat. I pick up my first health worker and he tells me he will be very busy with work that evening. He has only brought one pack of instant noodles with him: that is his New Year’s Eve dinner.Afterwards, I go to a friend’s house. He is alone too because the lockdown prevented his family from visiting. We have a simple but nice meal. It is very different from past celebrations. Normally, I go travelling or spend time with my mother. Although there are only two of us, she always prepares a lavish meal for a proper celebration, with fried lotus root, Chinese kale and fish meatballs (we call these yuanzi in Chinese, yuan meaning “round” and symbolising reunion).We don’t talk about the outbreak at the dinner table. It’s New Year’s Eve, after all. We should at least cheer up for tonight.Saturday 25 January I wake up early and drive health workers to their shift. Because of the outbreak and lockdown, I have barely slept. The health worker tells me they do not know how long the city will be closed, and the situation is still worsening. The number of deaths and cases is increasing every day. I’m given a special mask for protection.The biggest problem with this outbreak is that information was not shared with the public quickly enough. This is a failing that cannot be undone. If the news was released earlier, the outbreak would not be as serious now. I don’t know enough about the situation with medical supplies, but I hope the government can mobilise to ensure hospitals are well stocked. I feel ordinary people like us are the main force protecting Wuhan at the moment. Monday 27 January It’s another rainy day. I visit a hotel manager who is offering free accommodation for health workers who have no way of travelling. Many hotels have begun to do the same thing. Some people are responsible for transferring health workers, and some people buy supplies for the hospital at their own expense.The streets are still deserted. No one dares to go out for dinner. The supermarket has already closed before 7.30pm. I see more ambulances today than usual. At night I see videos online of people in several buildings chanting “keep going Wuhan” at each other. I guess the city is somewhat suffocating.Tuesday 28 January It is the sixth day of closing the city. I do not go out today, because it has been exhausting.Wednesday 29 January The government has allocated car services, posted information notices and arranged for employees to disinfect the corridors of residential buildings. It hits me that cleaners in this city still work every day. They have no rest and are disinfecting and cleaning the streets.In the past, when there were major festivals in Wuhan, buildings would display light shows to celebrate. Tonight, along the bank of Yangtze River, buildings are lit up with the words “Keep up Wuhan”.I think everyone’s emotions are staying stable. As the weather is better, we can gradually see a small number of people exercise outdoors. The work of volunteers has cheered people. Of course, not everyone is coping well. People whose family members or friends are infected are suffering.

The patients are receiving specialist NHS care and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.”It is understood that the pair travelled to the UK from China recently and are believed to be Chinese nationals. They are undergoing treatment at the specialist Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases Centre in Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.Cases in the UK have long been expected. The virus has already spread to 22 other countries outside China.The pair had been at the StayCity apartment hotel in York when they became ill. A StayCity spokesman said: “We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business. The apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor.”Public Health England (PHE) is urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with the two people. It said steps would be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it was “identifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk”.Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: “Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.”Prof Peacock previously said that while staff are working to trace people who have been in contact with the pair, they do not currently have any idea of how high that number might be.The PHE definition of close contact is being within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes.Guests were continuing to check in for weekend breaks in York on Friday. Outside the hotel, two guests told the  that as recently as Friday morning they had been told by reception staff that reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on Wednesday were “lies”.“This morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,” said Andy Neale, 21, who was staying at StayCity for the night with his girlfriend. “It’s not ideal. They should’ve taken some precaution.”He said the incident had marred the couple’s getaway. “My girlfriend is stressing out, she’s using hand wipes on everything.”A family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from Asia to see their daughter, who is a student in York, said they had been told the reports of cases were “false information”.The PHE supported the decision not to close the hotel. It said: “The design of the accommodation means that there is minimal interaction between guests and, following a risk assessment by our experts, closing the accommodation was not necessary. Appropriate infection and prevention control measures are being implemented.”Earlier, Whitty said: “The NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections, and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had to prevent further spread.“We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The chief medical officers for the four countries of the UK raised the risk level from low to moderate on Thursday evening in the wake of the WHO declaring coronavirus to be an international emergency. The UK has been on high alert for days, with 177 people tested for the virus, of whom 175 proved negative.In recent days ambulance workers and paramedics have been seen in protective suits in a number of places. As well as the York incident, a man was taken away from student accommodation in London. The University of Bristol said one person admitted to hospital with symptoms as a precaution had been discharged after being cleared of coronavirus.The UK had comprehensive plans in place for dealing with the arrival of the Wuhan coronavirus. It also has a good track record. Several cases of Mers – Middle East respiratory syndrome, which is also caused by a coronavirus – have been diagnosed in the past in travellers and in two healthcare workers who were infected by patients before anyone realised they had the virus. All were nursed in hospital infectious disease units and recovered.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The chief medical officer’s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other.“The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both Sars and Mers in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/695e5f4332f1285b4ec0cf3a3dc3db3bf407490d/0_115_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d14d9497b0a477b9081a170efb39f137","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan china how worried doctor","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how is it transmitted from one person to another, and at what point should you see a doctor?It is a novel coronavirus – a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city, which also sold live and newly slaughtered animals. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples.The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of 30 January, the death toll in China stands at 170, with more than 7,500 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has been confirmed outside mainland China, in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and in Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, after more than 160 were tested and found negative. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by World Health Organization (WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holiday, which started on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities in Hubei province are in lockdown. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. A key concern is the range of severity of symptoms – some people appear to suffer only mild illness while others are becoming severely ill. This makes it more difficult to establish the true number of infected people and the extent of transmission. But the authorities are keen to stop the spread and anxious about whether the virus could become more potent than it so far appears to be.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The NHS advises that there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the WHO will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.Healthcare workers could be at risk if they unexpectedly came across someone with respiratory symptoms who had travelled to an affected region. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.

Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA WireUndecided voters are overwhelmingly in favour of change in next week’s general election, focus group research suggests, but many are struggling to decide which party represents the type of change they want to see.The findings suggest Fine Gael faces an uphill battle to stage a comeback in the final week of the campaign, though senior party figures remain confident that a focus on the economy and Brexit will regain ground for the party before voters go to the polls next Saturday.The research, conducted by Ipsos MRBI for The , finds that some voters are attracted to Sinn Féin’s message of radical change, but others are nervous about some of the party’s promises. Other voters are concerned about endangering the economic progress of recent years, despite a widespread sense that Leo Varadkar’s government is out of touch and has failed to deal with issues such as health and housing.The focus groups were conducted in Dublin and Mullingar last week among specially selected voters who are undecided or open to changing their voting intention. They are not intended as statistically representative of the electorate, or to provide data that can be extrapolated. Instead, they indicate attitudes among typical voters on a range of topics.Dissatisfaction with governmentThe findings bear out and explain poll findings that identify dissatisfaction with the current government, and suggest that a comeback for Fine Gael will be a challenge.Voters identified strongly with Sinn Féin’s message of change, and the performance of Mary Lou McDonald was cited as a positive in many of the discussions. Fine Gael figures said the campaign had now entered the final and decisive phase which they said would be focused on the issues of trust, the economy and how to form a government after the election.It is claimed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was always prepared for a tough opening to the campaign, as happened when the opening stages were dominated by issues such as health and housing, where Fine Gael is weakest. Senior party sources said they intended to press Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on exactly how he will form a government since he has ruled out coalition with Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. Coalition ruled outMr Martin has repeatedly ruled out entering government with Ms McDonald but Fine Gael sources say the party intends to pressure him on the wider issue of government formation with an emphasis on Sinn Féin.“That is how Micheál gets his government,” said one source. “What else has he got?”Those in Fianna Fáil say their strategy will not change as polling day approaches. Mr Martin said he would not “trust” Mr Varadkar not to enter into a coalition deal with Sinn Féin.Those campaigning across all parties and Independents say the rise in support for Sinn Féin in opinion polls is being reflected on the ground.Ms McDonald on Friday said a poll on Irish unity was an “absolute necessity” for Sinn Féin as a result of Brexit.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4158032.1580504503!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il staff committed party to backing rent freeze martin says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin has said that Fianna Fáil staff committed the party to introducing an emergency rent freeze as demanded in a charity’s policy document, but that he will not pursue such a measure if in government. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe .The Fianna Fáil leader last year called for the consideration of a rent freeze, but has since backed away from it citing legal advice. The measure was not included as a policy proposal in his party’s election manifesto. Mr Martin was pressed on his housing policy during an interview with RTÉ’s Bryan Dobson on Friday, and was specifically asked about an election document from the National Women’s Council of Ireland (NWCI).Mr Martin was one of a number of political figures who backed the NWCI’s manifesto which, among other things, called for an “emergency rent freeze”.When asked about this by Mr Dobson, Mr Martin said: “People from headquarters sent that over and that is something that they have dealt with. We are not promising a rent freeze because it is unconstitutional.” The comments were picked up by Sinn Féin, which Mr Martin has criticised due to his belief that its elected representatives are not in control of the party. He has alleged that decisions in Sinn Féin are made by “shadowy figures” and “unelected officials”.ClashedFormer Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams jokingly suggested on Twitter that Mr Martin, on the rent freeze, was being led by similar figures in his own party. It came after a day when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil clashed on who would enter government with Sinn Féin after the election. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Martin said the other’s party would bring Sinn Féin into coalition. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has accused Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar of arrogance by ruling out a coalition with her party.Mr Varadkar also denied Fine Gael’s efforts to pivot the election campaign towards Brexit and the economy is an effort to ratchet up a fear factor among the public about other parties.Mr Varadkar said on Friday it was justifiable for his party to set out its track record in government and during Brexit negotiations.“We have a tried and trusted team that has brought us this far. Fianna Fáil has an untried, untested and inexperienced team,” he said.Mr Martin claimed that Mr Varadkar had planned it for the election to fall near the time the UK departed the EU. “It’s very clear now that it was all choreographed and he thought he would get re-elected on the wave of Brexit day,” he said.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCounty councillor Ruairi Ó Murchu  and former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams canvassing   in Dundalk, Co Louth. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillSinn Féin’s canvassers, lit up on a grey January afternoon in their party-branded high-vis vests, are fanning out like ground troops across the Cox’s Demesne housing estate in Dundalk.Gerry Adams, the party’s former leader who is retiring from politics and his Dáil seat in Louth, follows, very slowly. He is wearing a fracture boot. Later, as a constituent and diehard fan rushes out from her house to give Adams a hug, Adams explains he went over on his foot at home.Tagging along with the former Sinn Féin president is the more nimble Ruairí Ó Murchú, a 41-year-old county councillor, who acknowledges the pressure of trying to retain the seat being vacated by this veteran of Irish politics: nobody wants to be the guy who loses Gerry Adams’s seat. Ó Murchú is confident that it was not just the personal vote for a high-profile political figure that elected both Adams and his Sinn Féin running mate Imelda Munster in 2016.The Dundalk councillor came third in last year’s local elections but is confident that “with a good ground game” the party can return two TDs in the election. Hard askÓ Murchú observes, in a nod to the party’s recent polling figures, that the ground is “somewhat better”.“We knew it would be a hard ask, particularly not having Gerry Adams running, and we did have a sobering local election. The results we are getting on the doors – we think we are in a really good place and that we can do this,” says Ó Murchú , a councillor since 2017.The party has poured a lot of effort into this county on the edge of the Border where support for Sinn Féin and Irish unity has been solid for years.The five-seater constituency is a bellwether for the election. Louth is said to have a seat each for Sinn Féin (either Ó Murchú or Munster), Fianna Fáil (undoubtedly, Declan Breathnach TD) and Fine Gael (probably Fergus O’Dowd TD). The final two seats will be a battle between the three parties seeking a second seat and a group of three others: former Labour TD Ged Nash, the Green Party’s long-time contender Mark Dearey and Peter Fitzpatrick, who is standing as an Independent this time around.Fitzpatrick is the unknown quantity the former Louth Gaelic football manager won a seat in 2016 for Fine Gael but left the party in 2018 over its pro-repeal stance in the abortion referendum and his frustrations over life on the backbenches. It is not clear whether as a celebrity candidate with a strong local profile he will take votes from Fine Gael by presenting himself as an ousted rebel, thereby tapping some of the clear anti-government sentiment, or whether he will struggle.Adams is certain of his own party’s chances of retaining two seats in the county.“I would like to think that it is a constituency we have republicanised. On the day if we get our vote out, we will be grand,” he said.If the reaction on the doorsteps of Cox’s Demesne – Dundalk’s first large council estate and a solidly Sinn Féin stronghold – is repeated elsewhere in the county, two TDs is definitely doable.Ó Murchú talks about Adams’s rock-star status and this is clear to see from the greetings he receives as limps about on Thursday afternoon. Asked what rocker his mentor most resembles, Ó Murchú joshes with Adams: “People have been talking about the Bee Gees lately but I am not sure he is too receptive to that jibe.”Republican dogThe only hostile reception for Sinn Féin around this estate comes from a dog named Saoirse who goes for a canvasser on a path to a front door, prompting a hard dash from freedom.“That’s the first dog called Saoirse that has ever attacked a republican, I think,” he says. “He must not be a republican dog he must be pretending to be a republican, a Fianna Fáil dog,” jokes John Connolly, a former IRA blanket man who now works for peace and his community. On the doorsteps, the party’s workers hear little of support for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. One man tells Adams he is adamant he won’t vote for “Leo Martin”. The constituent says that he is going to give his number two to Fitzpatrick, pointing to the Clann na Gael Gaelic club across the road from the estate, the sitting TD’s own club.The appetite around here is a clear desire for change and to see Sinn Féin in government. One of the canvassers out with Ó Murchú and Adams, Paddy Agnew, a former IRA member who was elected TD in this constituency during the 1981 hunger strikes, cannot understand the refusal of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to countenance coalition government with Sinn Féin.“There is peace everywhere. The war is over,” he said. “What do you have to do? Ian Paisley wouldn’t be doing what they are doing. They need to get on with it.” The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157694.1580484532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit brussels bids a fond farewell to erstwhile partner on britain s departure day","story":" Brexit supporters burned a European Union flag beside Downing Street in central London  as others jeered at pro-EU demonstrators in the final hours before the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU.

Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersEU leaders marked Friday’s midnight Brexit formally with speeches expressing regret but resolutely facing into the future challenges of climate change and the digital revolution. It was an upbeat message, as Union Jacks came down off the institutions and a memo went out to 3,000 staff reminding them not to share internal communications with their erstwhile partner’s diplomats.The UK now enters 11 months of transition – but outside the EU.It’s not the end of the world. “The story does not end here,” European Parliament president David Sassoli told journalists. Far from it. Europe faces the future and its many challenges UK-less, but with plenty of confidence.Commission president Ursula von der Leyen quoted Jean Monnet, architect of European construction: “I am not pessimistic. I am not optimistic. I’m determined.”Some 700 UK citizens remain on the commission payroll and its spokesman was insisting that there is no question about their loyalty.The presidents of the three central institutions, von der Leyen, David Sassoli and EU Council president Charles Michel, spoke to journalists in the visitors’ centre of the parliament.Michel, who admitted his “mixed feelings” at the UK departure, emphasised the immediate challenge of making the EU more accountable and loved by citizens, and reiterated the mantra heard from all EU leaders recently that although “the EU wants the closest possible future relationship with the UK ”,the “more the UK erges from EU standards the less access it will have to the single market”.Alignment of planetsHe rejected the suggestion that Brexit might represent the beginning of the end of the EU and argued that, on the contrary, they were seeing that very rare alignment of the planets in which MEPs, the council and commission are now working off a common agenda. He said that unity is never a given or easy, but required constant effort.Von der Leyen said the central challenges are climate change and digitalisation. On both, she said, the “new chapter that Brexit represents in the EU’s history” must see it lead on a global level. “Strength does not lie in splendid isolation but our unique collaboration,” the president said, insisting that the UK would find a strong new relationship with the union, “but never as good as membership”.She spoke of the extraordinary, “very precious” experience of 3½ years of unity of the 27 in securing the withdrawal agreement that allowed the safeguarding of citizens’ rights, the securing of a financial settlement, and “the protection of our member state Ireland”.In an impassioned response to one reporter, Sassoli asked “why does everyone want to ide us today? Because when there are common rules, we live better and defend those who are weaker. Where there are no rules, only the strongest prevail. Perhaps those who want to ide us are afraid of a world with rules.“ At this moment, I believe that the EU’s importance lies in the answer that we are able to give to this question,” Sassoli added. “Not only for us, but for a global world that has to live by rules. Without rules, the strongest will prevail and the weakest will be excluded. And the EU does not want that.”On Monday – as soon as possible after Brexit – the commission will publish its draft negotiations mandate for the talks with the UK on the future relationship.Irish airsBrussels said its own farewell on Thursday night. The mayor of this very Anglophile city ordered the lighting up of the Grand Place, the city’s magnificent central cobbled square, in the colours of the Union Jack. Bands played British and a few Irish airs.There was an authentic London taxi, a red phone box, busby-toting sentries, and Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were to be seen. Out, they explained, on their most important inquiry yet, the search for the best frites in Brussels.And the iconic Manneken Pis, a miniature statue of a small boy peeing in a fountain, was dressed up as John Bull. An affectionate but not entirely reverent farewell.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph:  Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesAt Parliament Square in London Brexiteers are celebrating Britain’s departure from the EU in the rain. Cars are still driving by. They’re all waiting for familiarly triumphalist speeches from Nigel Farage, Ann Widdecombe, Wetherspoon’s Tim Martin and others.All afternoon a few thousand people have been waving Union, St George’s and American flags while singing “Goodbye EU” to the tune of Auld Lang Syne. A stall is giving out free “English apples” while a man sells UK flags made in China (I checked). An Elvis impersonator sings Elvis songs rewritten to reflect BritishEU relations. Another man spends the day ostentatiously standing on an EU flag. People ring bells.Craig Thorpe, from ‘Bikers for Brexit’, tells me that Brexit is going to be so successful most EU countries will also leave. Voting Leave is more about sovereignty than immigration for him, he says. He runs a taxi firm and has many foreign drivers.\u0026nbsp“But migration is out of control, isn’t it?” says Jason Roberts.Kev Blackburn, who’s wearing a red Donald Trump hat, knows a man who can help. What if Trump doesn’t give them a good trade deal? “Like making us eat chlorinated chicken?” says another man.Geoff Courtenay is holding a sign that says “bye bye EU” a few times. He’s a “kipper” he says (UKIPer) but he’s worried about “the border down the Irish Sea”. He says border trade can surely be handled technologically and that Ireland “will have to have a sensible immigration policy”.\u0026nbspDan Day is setting up a table for a petition with the help of a little girl dressed as a Crusader. His huge placard reads: “We the Sovereign Citizens of the United Kingdom demand a redress of our God-given right to Liberty, Free Speech, Assembly, Self-defence, National Self-Determination and Christian Faith.” He has a small gun pinned to his lapel. “It’s a Thompson,” he says. “An English gun.” (It’s not an English gun). “We should have the right to bear arms.”But why? “Coming from an Irishman?” he says. “You should know why.”Nigel Marcham, “The Little Veteran”, is an activist affiliated with Never Surrender, a group that objects to trying veterans for crimes in service. Some of his friends wave flags featuring the Red Hand of Ulster. He’s accompanied by “The Active Patriot” who’s here today livestreaming everything on YouTube. The Active Patriot wears a T-shirt with the slogan: “It’s okay to be white”.\u0026nbsp“I made it specially for today,” he says. “Is there something wrong with being white?”Marcham talks at length about “racism against white people”. Eventually, I say that all of the problems he rails against sound like a product of right-wing classist policies rather than race and I point out that the British parliament is largely made up of white people. “It should be!” says Marcham.In St Stephen’s Tavern, a middle-aged woman responds to a man shouting “Get Brexit Done” by saying: “Brexit is the worst possible thing for refugees, for women, for children for disabled people”.“How did we win two world wars then?” he says.At around three, a small pro-EU protest march arrives and is greeted by people screaming “Fifth columnists!” and “Traitorous scum!”. A man gathers a ring of photographers around him as he burns what he says is an EU flag. “Was that really an EU flag?” someone asks. “It doesn’t look like the right colour.”“All I know is that it wasn’t my flag,” he says.A woman screams into a policeman’s face that he’s part of an institution that condones child abuse. A man from the English Defence League shouts at me: “You’re the Irish journalist. You can go right f**king back home.” He has apparently just seen me on Active Patriot’s live stream. Later I see him dancing blissfully to Sweet Caroline as it plays from a speaker on a truck.Judith Clementson has come from Portsmouth and says she’s been “fighting for this longer than Nigel”. In 1997, she ran for parliament with Jimmy Goldsmith’s Referendum Party. She wants sovereignty and “controlled” migration but believes most people here haven’t actually read the withdrawal agreement. She fears Britain will be embroiled with the EU for a long time. So, why is she here? “I’m celebrating the end of the beginning,” she says.\u0026nbspSixty-four-year old leaver Jeremy Ruygrok is explaining himself to a slightly exasperated remain-voter called Anthony. Ruygrok is a half-Dutch Taoist whose father was a follower of the mystic Aleister Crowley. He has lived all over the world but his business was ripped off, he says, and now he’s homeless in London. He’s been energised by Brexit, he says, “but Britain has been lost to cultural Marxists”.Anthony can’t believe what he’s hearing: “But you’ve literally just won!”“I’ve been black pilled,” says Ruygrok before explaining “the pills”. To be blue pilled, he explains, is to be ignorant of the world’s deep conspiracies. To be red pilled is to see them. To be black pilled is to see them but still believe all is lost. He thinks a civil war is on the horizon. “I don’t really have hope for the future.” He laughs. “But let them have their day.”He’s planning to leave Britain. Where will he go? “Orban’s Hungary” he says.“But you can’t travel there freely anymore,” says Anthony. “You voted for that!”“Orban has said he’ll take us in. They’ve got things right over there.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Erin SchaffThe New York TimesDemocratic presidential hopefuls are descending on Iowa this weekend in a final push for votes ahead of Monday’s caucus, amid signs that the contest could be one of the tightest in recent history.\u0026nbspThe party’s voters in the midwestern state will choose their candidate to take on the presumed Republican nominee, President Donald Trump, in November’s presidential election on Monday night in the first-in-the-nation caucus.Iowa marks the start of the primary season, with New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina all holding their primaries or caucuses this month, ahead of Super Tuesday on March 3rd, which will see more than a dozen states pick their candidate. The Democratic party will choose the nominee to contest the November 3rd election at a convention in Milwaukee in July.Recent polling shows that Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has been gaining support in Iowa, boosted by an energised support base and a lucrative grassroots fundraising programme. According to a poll of polls by Real Clear Politics, Mr Sanders is leading the pack in Iowa with 23.8 per cent support among Democrats, followed by Joe Biden on 20.2 per cent. Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is polling at 15.8 per cent, followed closely by Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and Minnesota native Amy Klobuchar on 9.6 per cent.National pollMs Sanders’s late surge was also borne out in a national poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal published on Friday. It puts Mr Sanders slightly ahead with 27 per cent support among Democratic voters nationally, compared to Mr Biden at 26 per cent. Ms Warren was at 15 per cent followed by Mr Buttigieg and Ms Klobuchar on single digits.\u0026nbsp Mr Sanders’s first-place status marks a turnaround from a month ago. That same poll had the veteran socialist senator on 21 per cent, with Mr Biden well ahead with 28 per cent of the vote.Though Mr Sanders – who narrowly lost the Iowa caucus to Hillary Clinton in 2016 – has nudged ahead of his rivals in recent weeks, most polls are still within the margin of error, pointing to an unpredictable result on Monday.The weeks ahead of the caucus have been overshadowed by the impeachment trial of Mr Trump, which has forced the four Democratic candidates who are members of the Senate to remain in Washington. Senators Sanders, Warren, Klobuchar and Michael Bennet have all been attending the trial, which convenes every day except Sunday, keeping them away from the campaign trail in the crucial recent weeks.Subpoena witnessesWith the Senate due to hold a key vote on whether to subpoena witnesses on Friday night, the impeachment trial could come to an end as early as this weekend. Should Republicans block a vote to subpoena witnesses – a prospect that was looking increasingly likely on Friday after Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would oppose witnesses – the Senate would then move to vote on impeachment, with Mr Trump virtually certain to be acquitted. Republicans are keen to wrap up the trial before next Tuesday, when the president will deliver the annual State of the Union address to Congress. As of Friday evening, all four senators running for the Democratic nomination were due to campaign in Iowa at some point this weekend, as they try to shore up support.Several candidates also unveiled new ad campaigns. Indiana mayor Mr Buttigieg, who has been campaigning intensively across the state, emphasised his freshness as a candidate, highlighting voters’ “hunger for a new kind of politics”. “The old style of politics is broken. We can’t keep doing the same thing and expect different results,” the 37-year-old military veteran states in a digital ad which will run on social media and digital platforms ahead of the vote.Four new adsSimilarly, Ms Warren’s campaign unveiled four new ads amid signs that she may be losing some support in the midwestern state, despite a surge late last summer. In particular, the ads appear to highlight Ms Warren’s ability to beat Mr Trump – a concern held by some voters. One ad, under the banner “She can win”, features a male voter who caucused for Mr Trump in 2016 but is now voting for Ms Warren.Iowa, a predominantly rural state with a population of 3 million people, has been the first US state to hold its selection procedure since the 1970s, giving it an outsized role in the presidential nomination process. On Monday, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will choose their candidates at more than 1,600 locations across the state. For the first time, the Democratic National Committee is also operating more than 90 “satellite” caucus sites to allow non-resident Iowans and those unable to attend traditional caucuses to cast their vote. \u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020matt cartoon february 1","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.US bars foreign nationals who recently travelled to China amid coronavirus fearsRemainers try to forget Brexit by booking city breaks Senate rejects new witnesses in Donald Trump impeachment trialHarvey Proctor accuses police of cover up in Operation Midland inquiryFacebook urges Government to press ahead with new laws to combat online harmJudge: Extent of knife attacks is depressingNigel Farage: This is the greatest moment in our modern historyUK exits European Union with parties across the countryTreasure hunter proves experts wrong over Saxon coin and rewrites historyBrexiteers up and down the country party like it is 1972Traditional radio is out of date, claims BBC chiefDuke of York’s accuser has urged him to \u0026#39do the right thing\u0026#39 and talk to the FBIThe final hours of Brexit: \u0026#39democracy has returned - this is our country again\u0026#39Donald Trump attacks Democratic rivals as focus turns to election with impeachment acquittal expectedWoman arrested after breaching security checkpoints at Trump\u0026#39s Mar-a-Lago clubBrexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  Brexit deal: what does it mean for you?How might Brexit affect the UK in 2020?How will the Brexit transition period work?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"two people england have testedpositive coronavirus","story":"A hotel in York is at the centre of Britain’s coronavirus scare, after its guests were confirmed as the first two known cases of the virus in the UK.The pair, now being treated at a specialist NHS unit in Newcastle, had been taken away by paramedics in Hazmat suits, after falling ill at the Stay City Hotel.They were two members of the same family, understood to be tourists who came from China on holiday to the UK in recent days.Health officials are now attempting to track down anyone who came into contact with them  during their three day stay at the 220-bed hotel.But questions have been raised about why the hotel had been allowed to remain open for business.The firm said it had been advised by Public Health England (PHE) that there is “minimal ongoing risk of infection” to guests or staff, and said the apartment - currently sealed off - would undergo a thorough clean.Officials are still trying to contact almost 500 people who flew in from Wuhan in recent weeks, in a bid to persuade them to “self-isolate” themselves.Meanwhile, a plane carrying 83 Britons from Wuhan, China landed at RAF Brize Norton. The passengers have since arrived at an NHS facility in the Wirral by bus, where they will be quarantined for two weeks.While those attending the group wore hazmat protection suits, the drivers wore no protective gear or masks.Officials said risk assessments had deemed that they did not need protection, because they did not have close contact with the group, which is defined as being within two metres of a person for at least 15 minutes. Rows of seats between the driver and group were left empty.The group in the Wirral are being housed in fully furnished rooms, with access to food, laundry facilities and access to medical staff who will monitor their condition. Anyone with suspicious symptoms will be taken to the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Hospital.Prof Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the measures taken by PHE to prevent the possible spread of disease were inadequate.He said it was “worrying” officials had revealed so little about the victims of the outbreak, and said they had a duty to ensure those who had been put at risk knew about it.Professor Sharon Peacock, national infection service director, said anyone who believed they had been in contact with the two people in York should “self-isolate” for 14 days, and call their GP or dial 111 if they developed symptoms.PHE could not explain how people could do this without knowing who the pair are. These are the first two confirmed cases of the deadly virus on British soilProf Peacock said PHE currently do not have “any idea” how many people may have been in contact with the infected patients. Officials said the design of the apartment-style accomodation in York was such that there was “minimal interaction between guests,” so that closing the hotel block was not deemed necessary. The assurances came despite warnings from WHO that the virus, which is mainly spread through coughs and sneezes, can also survive for short periods on surfaces.Guests at the apartment block said staff had not told them the pair had been taken away to be tested for coronavirus, with them only learning about the cases on the news.Yesterday Andy Neale, who was visiting York from Manchester with his girlfriend, said:  “I’m fuming about not being told.” He said: I am a bit shocked because this morning one of the members of staff said it was nothing when I presented them with a news article.We asked again this afternoon at around 3:30pm and they said they were waiting to hear from the NHS and said \u0027don\u0027t worry\u0027. I am quite angry about it.”Yesterday, England\u0027s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said: We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.”In a press conference, Professor Whitty said that anyone in Britain who has returned from China in the last fortnight with coughs and colds should “self-isolate” for two weeks.The chief medical officer warned that the epidemic in China is “spreading out of control” as Britain declared its first two cases.The senior medic said he was confident the UK would handle the threat, but he warned that coping with the disease was a “marathon not a sprint”.Until now, only those who have returned from Wuhan have been urged to take measure to prevent the spread of the disease.The new advice goes further.Prof Whitty said: “If people have come back from China with any symptoms they should self-isolate for 14 days. We are being pragmatic, it’s a relatively subtle shift but it is significant.”He said global figures so far, suggesting 9,776 cases and 213 deaths are “almost certainly an underestimate”. New research in The Lancet estimates that 75,000 are infected in Wuhan alone. Prof Whitty stressed that the threat level has been raised in the UK - from low to moderate - because of the spread of disease in China, not because two cases have been diagnosed here.He said: “The biggest course of transmission is in China. There are patients outside China but they are below 10 numbers. There have not been any deaths outside China. There have not been any sustained transmissions outside China.  All have managed to prevent sustained transmission .. we will get occasional cases that is not surprising… but we are confident in our ability to manage this.”He said the raising of UK threat levels, after the World Health Organisation declared a global emergency, related to the way the disease is spreading in China.He said: “The risk comes from the epidemic in China spreading out of control. The numbers are going up very fast.”He described the virus as “moderately transmissable” - “not at the top end of the range.”“In terms of mortality the numbers look around 2 per cent,” he said, comparing it favourably to other recent viruses.Ebola had mortality of 70 per cent, with rates of 30 per cent for Mers and 20 per cent for Sars, he said. This afternoon, a flight carrying 83 Britons landed at RAF Brize Norton after being evacuated from China.There were expected to be as many as 150 passengers from the UK on board, and several people complained that they were told too late to make it to the airport.Joe Armitt, who is on the flight, told Sky News that the plane is very empty.Reacting to the news of confirmed cases of the deadly disease in the UK, Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: “The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The Chief Medical Officer’s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other.“The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both SARS and MERS in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community.”A French flight carrying around 200 people landed near Marseille this morning and they will be placed in quarantine in a holiday camp for two weeks.One of the French citizens evacuated from Wuhan has been hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms.The evacuations come as new figures suggest that as many as 35,000 passengers could be affected by the cancellation of flights to mainland China by UK airlines due to the coronavirus outbreak. Virgin Atlantic have suspended the route between Heathrow and Shanghai for two weeks, while British Airways said on Wednesday that daily flights from London to Shanghai and Beijing had been grounded.The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global health emergency on January 30 as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread around the world. As of Friday morning, 9,776 cases have been confirmed and 213 people in China have died.But Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general said the decision to declare an emergency was not a reflection on China\u0027s handling of the crisis - instead it was prompted by the spread of the virus to countries with weaker health systems.“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China,” said Dr Tedros. “Our greatest concern is the deportation of the virus … to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill prepared to deal with it.”On Thursday India confirmed its first case of the coronavirus and authorities have now said that 1,000 people are under observation in Kerala. The confirmation came as new infections continued to emerge across the globe - 24 countries and territories have now reported cases. Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore have all identified more than 10 cases, while Australia and Taiwan have 9 each, Malaysia 8 and Macau 7. In Europe, France has reported five cases as of Friday morning, Germany four, and Italy has declared a state of emergency after reporting two coronavirus infections overnight. Sweden confirmed its first case on Friday afternoon.Thailand has confirmed its first case of human-human transmission after a taxi driver was infected with the coronavirus. It is the fifth country - following the United States, Vietnam, Germany and Japan - outside China to report domestic spread.But when announcing a global emergency, the WHO also warned against placing trade and travel restrictions on China such as border closures, visa restrictions, quarantines of healthy travellers and evacuating foreign nationals from Wuhan, saying these measures were unnecessary.But countries are continuing to ramp up containment measures - and the US has been sharply criticised by Beijing after raising the travel warning to the highest possible level, effectively warning Americans not to travel to the country and urging those already there to leave. Certain US officials\u0027 words and actions are neither factual nor appropriate, China\u0027s foreign affairs ministry spokesman said. Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the US rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill.But on Friday, the US said it was barring entry for foreign nationals who have travelled to China in the past two weeks. Americans who have spent time in Hubei province will be quarantined.Six of Hong Kong’s 14 mainland crossings with China have now also been sealed, while Singapore has announced it is closing its border.Saudi Arabia has joined a raft of countries in advising citizens not to travel to China, Pakistan has suspended all flights to China and Guatemala is imposing a blanket ban on anyone who has recently been to China. Russia has also confirmed it\u0027s first two cases - despite closing its 2,670 mile border with China and announcing it will stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Russia\u0027s deputy prime minister said that the infected people had been isolated, adding that all direct flights to China would he halted from 9pm this evening - with the exception of one airline, Aeroflot.The outbreak is continuing to have huge implications for China\u0027s economy as unprecedented quarantines continue.And on Friday, film makers announced that a new movie, Enter the Fat Dragon, will premiere via online streaming on Saturday instead of in cinemas due to the coronavirus. It is the second film in China to debut online because of the outbreak.Giovanni Torre in Perth writes: The Australian Government has come under fire for its plan to quarantine hundreds of its citizens on Christmas Island, almost 2,000km from the country’s coast, after evacuating them from Hubei Province in China.Australia now has nine confirmed cases of coronavirus, with several more suspected.More than 600 Australians have registered for help after the Chinese government effectively locked down Wuhan and surrounding areas in Hubei province. 150, so far, have expressed interest in the Christmas Island plan.More than 140 of the 600 are children.The evacuees, mostly Australians of Chinese descent or origin, would be quarantined on the remote Australian territory for two weeks.Some of them, and medical experts in Australia, have raised concerns about the plan but the Government maintains it is the most practical solution in the short term.Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told local media on Thursday that he “can\u0027t clear out a hospital in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane”.“I don\u0027t have a facility otherwise that we can quickly accommodate for what might be many hundreds of people, and Christmas Island is purpose-built for exactly this scenario,” he said.Christmas Island has been used by the Australian Government to detain asylum seekers, and the facility in question currently holds a young Tamil family from Sri Lanka who face deportation despite an outcry from the Queensland community in which they had settled.Conditions in the detention facility have long been criticised by human rights advocates.Officials have told the prospective Wuhan evacuees they will need to pay A$1,000 (£512) for the flight to Christmas Island, and agree to stay there for two weeks, before returning to Australia if it is safe to do so.The recent evacuation by the Royal Australian Navy of people from Mallacoota as a result of Australia’s ongoing fire crisis did not include a price tag for those rescued.The head of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said Christmas Island is ill-prepared to receive the evacuees, as its medical facilities are inadequate if somebody falls seriously ill.Dr Bartone said Australia was among the most capable countries in the world at containing the spread of infectious diseases, but that Christmas Island was ill-conceived as a health quarantine location.“We feel that the repatriation to Christmas Island, to a place which has been previously the focus of populations under enormous mental and physical trauma and anguish, is not a really appropriate solution. We’ll be calling on the PM and the relevant ministers to find a much more humane solution to dealing with a group of very vulnerable and concerned Australians,” he told local media.Researchers from the University of Queensland are part of a team working to develop a vaccine to the virus within four months.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/31/15/infact-norway-electric-car.jpg","title":"electric cars facts hybrid charging battery power energy pros cons","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?How far will one go on a charge?What are the advantages of an electric car?What are the disadvantages?Don’t they take ages to charge?Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?What about hybrids?Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?On my electric car odyssey, I thought I ought to start by sharing some basics with you, in Q\u0026ampA form. I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater.

Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble.

His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up.

It would most likely be the new USB-C standard or something like it, meaning that Apple would have to change the port used in their iPhones.Apple hits out at EU proposal to force phones to have same chargerEuropean politicians passed the motion by\u0026nbsp582 votes to 10. While it does not introduce any new rules, it calls on the European Commission to examine new legislation, and the Commission has already suggested that it could introduce new rules forcing companies to adopt a single charger.It also suggests that companies should work to ensure they all use the same wireless charging standard. That largely happens already, with most phone companies using the Qi standard.If such a change were to happen, people would no longer need to get a new charger each time they buy a new device, the motion noted.Ten years ago, the European Parliament signed an agreement with technology companies in which they would voluntarily work to reduce the numbers of chargers across different devices. Politicians say that agreement has failed, though some including Apple have argued that those ten years have seen a vast reduction in the number of ports, with just two – Lightning and USB-C – used on almost all new devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother.

Road to RomaTo All the Boys: PS I Still Love YouAll the Bright PlacesCagaster of an Insect CageCreated with Sketch.The 40 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan. This return to the world of the Jim Henson 1982 fantasy movie is very much a series of two halves. The first five episodes are a confused hodgepodge of exposition and world building. But once it settles down this prequel to the film spins a fantastic tale of puppet Gelflings and Skeksis vying for power in a feudal kingdom… a game of thrones, as it were. Westeros regulars Natalie Dormer, Lena Headey and Nathalie Emmanuel star alongside Simon Pegg, Mark Hamill and Alicia Vikander.   3340 The Haunting of Hill HouseA rare TV horror that genuinely gets under the skin. Very loosely adapted from 1959 Shirley Jackson gothic classic, Mike Flanagan’s series chronicles the adulthood agonies of a family whose childhood was traumatised by a run-in with a creepy mansion. Rather than lazy jump-scares, the series ratchets up the dread slowly yet unyieldingly. A few episodes in and you may find yourself holding your breath, so searing is the tension. To really freak you, Flanagan has also inserted dozens of hidden ghosts into the background. See how many you can spot – and good luck getting to sleep afterwards. Bonkers on a swizzle stick, this series from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij makes Twin Peaks look like an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Prairie (Marling) is an inter-dimensional wanderer with a strange past and an even weirder future. She recruits a group of high school students, teaching them the “movements” that permit travel across time and space. That’s the jumping off point for a meditation on existence, identity and fate. Controversially cancelled after just two seasons – and the mother of all cliff-hangers – the OA is nonetheless a sensory experience worth your time. Did we mention the talking octopus? David Attenborough provides the narration – but the real star is the stunning camerawork and general sumptuousness, courtesy of the team behind BBC mega-hits Blue Planet and Planet Earth. Shots of flamingos running across salt flats and blue whales chilling off the coast of Mexico are the perfect excuse to spring for a Netflix HD subscription. Game of Thrones exited to the strains of a thousand damp squibs imploding at once. And it’s too early to say whether adaptations of the Witcher or The Wheel of Time will be any use. But one fantasy saga worth getting your chainmail in a twist for is this kid’s animated series from Avatar: The Last Airbender director Aaron Ehasz. The setting is bog standard swords and sorcery – there are dragons, elves and magicians – but the execution is riveting. Ethnic tensions between elves and humans are compellingly drawn – and did we mention the dragons? A gothic adult cartoon based on an obscure video game does not sound enticing. Yet this baroque fever dream starring Richard Armitage (Thorin from The Hobbit movies) as the last living member of an excommunicated family of vampire hunters and Graham McTavish as a misunderstood Count Dracula (he’s upset after his wife is burned the stake) is a riveting slow burner. A third season is in production. 3840 Tuca and BertieNetflix has lately turned cancelling shows into a competitive sport. This new animated drama from the creators of BoJack Horseman was canned just two months after its debut despite much critical acclaim. In Netflix’s defence, it is rather wacky. To quote Deadline, it tells of  “the friendship between two 30-year-old bird-women who live in the same apartment building, Tuca (Tiffany Haddish), a cocky, care-free toucan and Bertie (Ali Wong), an anxious, daydreaming songbird.” The humour is surreal but, just like BoJack Horseman, the emotional beats – specifically its depiction of the central relationship – yank the heartstrings.Reality TV, the Netflix way. Imagine Bake Off with glass-blowing instead of marzipan manipulation and YouTube star Nick Uhas in for Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig. Ten artists test their glass blowing mastery in a series of challenges. The winner walks away with $60,000 and a residency at the Corning Museum of Glass in New York. Just like Bake Off, it’s riveting viewing even if you can’t tell a kiln from a kangaroo.   4040 Dead to MeLinda Cardellini and Christina Applegate join forces for this super-dark comedy about two women who meet at a therapy group for the recently bereaved. They strike up a natural friendship – but, as we slowly learn, each has secrets they’d rather not share. James Marsden is fantastic as the smarmy ex of Judy (Cardellini) while the behind the scenes involvement of producers Will Ferrell and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy director Adam McKay provides a clue as to the mad-cap humour. A word-of-mouth success, it has been picked up for a second series.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 640 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2140 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).Netflix has been binning shows as if it is going out of fashion. But that didn’t stop Drake from persuading it to revive the Channel 4 drama about rival drug dealers in a fictional south London neighbourhood. Middle-aged Irishman Ronan Bennett captures the reality of life for many young black British people with tremendously sensitivity, while the cast is headed by Ashley Walters, Kane “Kano” Robinson, rapper Little Simz and Mercury Prize winner Dave. A police procedural adapted from a long-form magazine exposé of American justice’s entrenched misogyny sounds like nobody’s idea of a fun night in. But Unbelievable makes serious points about how sufferers of sexual assault are marginalised and victim-blamed while also drawing the viewer into a compelling mystery. Unflinching yet never gratuitous, it stars Toni Collette and Merritt Wever as hard-bitten detectives investigating a serial rapist. Booksmart’s Kaitlyn Dever, meanwhile, plays a young woman wrongly accused of crying wolf when a man attacks her in her apartment. Time becomes a loop in this sci-fi parable about a troubled New Yorker who finds herself reliving the final hours of her life over and over. Is the cosmos itself trying to tell her something? Or is she simply losing her marbles. Natasha Lyonne excels as damaged, potty-mouthed Nadia. Her improbable love interest is played by Charlie Barnett.Gerard Way’s surreal comic book has translated impressively to the screen. Umbrella Academy unfolds as a lightly unhinged anti-Avengers. A family of super-powered siblings tries to solve the mystery of the murder of their domineering adoptive father, who plucked them from the arms of their mothers and raised them to be humanity’s first line of defence. Ellen Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan head the cast in a series that plays out like a Marvel movie directed by Wes Anderson. Watch out for a cameo by R\u0026ampB queen Mary J Blige as an inter-dimensional assassin. Oscar-nominated Ava DuVernay makes a foray into television with a gripping four-part retelling of the 1989 Central Park Five case in which five African Americans were charged with the rape of a jogger in central Manhattan.

Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far.

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Hawaii — which is twice the size of the next largest solar scope — have captured an array of cell-like structures that cover the surface of the sun, each taking up space roughly the size of the US state of Texas.It is hoped that by focussing on these areas, scientists may be better able to predict changes in the sun’s surface — including solar flares that can knock out power grids and put satellites at risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance Córdova, National Science Foundation (NSF) director, said: “Since NSF began work on this ground-based telescope, we have eagerly awaited the first images.\u0026nbsp“We can now share these images and videos, which are the most detailed of our Sun to date.

It also confirms a prediction of Einstein\u0027s general theory of relativity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrame-dragging has been spotted on Earth, where satellites have examined the gravitational field of our planet as it rotates. But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

The time to jump ship isnt when there are serious problems.The Queen pulled no punches when she sat down with Prince Harry after he and Meghan released the bombshell news they were quitting.At a summit in Sandringham, her Majesty laid down the law - saying they can no longer formally represent her despite the couple insisting they wanted to fly the flag for the Queen after quitting the Firm.In her decisive statement, the -year-old monarch also revealed the couple would pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.Under the new deal, Harry and Meghan will retain their HRH status — but have agreed to not use their titles while trying to forge a new le in North America.It has since been reported Kate Middleton will be front and centre of the Royal Family with Prince William vowing Megxit wont ruin their plans.A source claimed : William knows he will have a lot more work this year and is happy to perform whatever duties the Queen asks of him. But he is determined that won’t be to the detriment of his charity work.It comes after speculation of a feud between brothers William and Harry during the so-called Megxit drama, with it claimed they have since made peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The figures lay bare that the five-week policy simply isn’t working - it just drives people further into poverty.Unless the DWP moves to a policy where benefits are paid promptly the queues for food banks in Glasgow, and across the country, will continue growing.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. In the written question, DWP minister Will Quince said: The Department’s deductions policy strikes a fair balance between a claimant’s need to meet their obligations and their ability to ensure they can meet their day-to-day needs.From October , Universal Credit deductions have been reduced to % of a claimant’s standard allowance down from % to better achieve these objectives.If youre struggling to make your benefits stretch to cover the bills then here are a few ways that you can get extra cash.You could also be missing out on much-needed cashyou arent on the right benefits, so make sure you check what youre entitled to.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free.

He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course. With Andy, somehow, there always is.He is himself accused of having sex with a -year-old lass procured for him by Epstein.This is Virginia Roberts. She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts. Well, OK, maybe a finger , but nowt more.Andrew has been implicated in this grotesque scandal for a long time now. The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there. I think people in Carlisle and Berwick could make a killing.Set up special centres where Scottish mums and dads can cross the border and beat their children without fear of punishment.You could sell special souvenir slippers or canes marked with “I Came To Carlisle To Bray The Kids”.A WOMAN with an apparent IQ of a small bowl of Maltesers has demanded that firms stop men chatting about football in the workplace. Ann Francke is from the Chartered Management Institute.She says that saying stuff like, “Hey, Leeds tore our lads a new a**ehole on Tuesday night” excludes women.No it doesn’t! It doesn’t exclude women who like football, does it  Whereas it does exclude men who couldn’t give a toss about the Leeds v Millwall game.Should we continue this sexist stereotyping and ban women from talking about Strictly or vaginal yeast infections What, under your regime, Ann, would people be allowed to talk about  Every subject excludes someone.TURKEY – the world’s worst country, in my view – is to introduce a “marry your rapist” law.A man charged with rape will be let off scot-freehe agrees to marry his victim.What the woman – or perhaps more usually, girl – thinks about this will not be taken into consideration.All this is part of president Tayyip Erdogans fervent wish to drag Turkey back into the seventh century.And he is having great success in his ambition.WELCOME to the world of , a newspaper for rich, stupid people living in North London.In yesterday’s issue they were terried about what to put in their morning cup of tea, other than tea.Milk is out because of greenhouse gases caused by the dairy industry.

And for rich people to pretend they’re not part of the capitalist system which drives climate change.No, not kidding. : A world beyond parody.I WONDERour new Government has made its first big mistake.Allowing the Chinese company Huawei a role in the development of G seems to me both naive and immoral.If you deal with a Chinese company the size of Huawei, you are basically dealing with the Chinese government.And this a regime that is trying to stle freedom of speech and democracy across its vast territory. Most obviously, in its bullying of Hong Kong.But worse than that is its treatment of Muslim Chinese people in the west of the country. Thousands upon thousands are held in “re-education” camps. Not to mention their occupation of Tibet.More pragmatically, China is a hostile, totalitarian, Communist country. The notion it will act in good faith is frankly laughable.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing. We are under no illusions. But we are convinced a fully independent Britain has a rosier future.And YOU made it happen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t want any risk of me catching coronavirus and passing it to my boy.We found out from Facebook and immediately decided to check out. I just cracked.”I was scared then and I am scared now.Fris Ilfi, , who recently arrived from Saudi Arabia to study for a chemistry PhD at York University, said: “I saw the man. He was sitting at reception. Two medics went to his room and tested him.Do you know the victims  Have you stayed at the hotel recently  Get in touch at tips-sm@news or “When I checked at reception, they told me it was normal flu. Guests were not in masks. Everything was carrying on as normal. I was scared then, and now.I’m trying to find somewhere  to stay.”Last night, after the government kept the public in the dark for hours, Staycity aparthotel finally confirmed it was at the centre of the UKs outbreak.A hotel spokesperson said: We have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in York have been tested positive for the coronavirus.We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business.Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, slammed the government after the hotel stayed open following the outbreak, insisting the Department of Healthhad a duty to warn the public of any risks.Professor Hunter told MailOnline: The [DoH] at least needs to tell people how big the potential spread of this virus is, and how much contact with the wider community these two have had.Why didnt the Department of Health say something sooner Some rooms at the hotel have been sealed off and are being deep-cleaned today - but otherwise its business as usual.The two patients have now been quarantined in Newcastle after testing positive.But the race is on to find anyone they came into contact with before they started showing symptoms on Wednesday.The Public Health England definition of close contact is being within two metres of the infected person for  minutes.Dramatic video footage showed hazmat paramedics swooping on the hotel after a man travelling with two others reported feeling unwell.Authorities are now desperately scrambling to contain the spiralling epidemic with fears up to , could be infected in the country.Meanwhile, a convoy of coaches carrying  Brits rescued from coronavirus-hit China has tonight arrived at the hospital where they will be quarantined for two weeks. The evacuees landed from the ground zero epicentre of Wuhan this afternoon to be treated at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral, Merseyside.Staff at the nearby Royal Liverpool Hospital have been warned to be on alert for patients showing possible coronavirus symptoms coming into AE this weekend.It is one of four specialist hospitals with Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centresin England.The flight, which contained adults and small children, landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire after Brits were rescued from the ground-zero epicentre of Wuhan.It comes as...Tonight some hotel guests were furious they had not been told about the coronavirus.Another hotel guest from the North East blasted: “The hotel have told us nowt. We don’t know what’s going on.And Andy Neale and Ellisa Imrie, both , from Manchester, said their trip to York “was a late Xmas present which had been ruined”.Ellisa said: “I’m fuming. The hotel has told us nothing.“They should be taking precautions anyway so people don’t cough over each other or touch somewhere they shouldn’t.”Health officials say they are working rapidly to identy any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread - amid frantic efforts to stop it spiralling out of control.Official advice urges anyone who has come into close contact with coronavirus sufferers to self-isolate to prevent the infection spreading.Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases.What theyll be doing is aiming to contact everybody who has been in contact with these two cases and prevent onward transmission.It confirms fears the government acted too late to prevent the crisis hitting Britain, only putting in travel restrictions several days after the outbreak worsened in China.Experts today said the news had come as no surprise and is what we have been expecting for the last week - despite repeated claims by ministers the crisis was under control.It means England is the rd country or territory outside of China to have confirmed coronavirus cases.Dr Michael Head, from the University of Southampton, warned how contagious and easily spread the deadly disease is.He said: Hopefully, as seen where, the case numbers will be very limited. But the key concern will bethere is signicant human to human transmission.Two students from Bristol and London were bundled out of accommodation yesterday with suited-up paramedics with suspected symptoms.It comes as China has its deadliest day yet with the death toll reaching  and cases surging towards ,.Despite todays rescue flight bringing home some of the Brits, many remain stranded in Wuhan after Chinese authorities said anyone with a local passport should stay.It left British families facing a tough decision - to remain together in the deadly zone or split their family by flying some members home.The evacuation came after the World Health Organisationdeclared an international public health emergency.Virgin Atlantic and British Airways have suspended flights from virus-hit China to the UK.Announcing the two cases in the UK, Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, said: We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus.The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identy any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread.We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately.We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.The British passengers on the evacuation flight - who have mainly been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province - had to sign a contract agreeing to isolation before they could board the flight, and underwent temperature checks.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The symptoms include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.British citizen Chris Hill, who lives in Wuhan with his we and four-year-old daughter, refused to take the offered flight as the FCO could not confirm he would be able to bring his daughter Renee with him as she is a Chinese citizen.With the current situation and the way the FCO is handling the diplomatic side of things, Im just losing faith, Mr Hill said.The Chinese government does not recognise dual nationality, and it is believed people with Chinese citizenship were unable to leave the affected area.Killer coronavirus has reached the UK, with two Brits struck down with the infection.Heres what you need to know...Where are the infected people in the UK Its unclear where the coronavirus victims are at the moment.But its understood they will have been taken to one of the UKs four high level isolation units.These include the Royal Free in London, Royal Liverpool Hospital, Newcastle Hospital and Guys and St Thomas in London.What precautions can I take again coronavirus The virus is transmitted between people in droplets from coughing and sneezing and touching or shaking hands.One of the best ways to protect yourself from catching -nCoV is to be aware of the symptoms, which include:Most victims of the virus die from complications including pneumonia and swelling in the lungs.It also causes swelling in the respiratory system, which can make it hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream - leading to organ failure and death.So far those who have died in China have been older or have a weakened immune system.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.It says that in order to reduce your risk of infection, you should:If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow this advice evenyou do not have symptoms of the virus.Should I wear a mask Chinese authorities have encouraged people to wear surgical masks to help stop the spread of the new virus.But some infectious disease experts say that theres little high-quality scientic evidence that proves the effectiveness of them outside of a clinical setting.Instead they say that washing your hands and avoiding people who are ill is way more important than wearing a mask.Will it spread Coronavirus is spread through coughing, sneezing and touching contaminated surfaces.Since the new infection emerged a month ago, cases have rapidly soared and spread borders.In recent weeks, the first human-to-human transmission in people who have never been to China have been confirmed.The World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern .Experts say that it was only a matter of time before the deadly bug hit the UK and warn it could spread - but its hoped cases will be very limited.Dr Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, said: “The UK cases are unsurprising to see.Given the spread to other European and North American countries, it was really only a matter of time until the UK ended up with confirmed cases.“Hopefully, as seen where, the case numbers will be very limited.The key concern will bethere is signicant human to human transmission.”What are the government doing Advanced monitoring at airports is being carried out on direct flights from China.A team of public health experts have been established at Heathrow to support anyone who feels unwell.This is in addition to medical staff who are already permanently based at all UK airports.The government has issued clinical guidance for the detection and diagnosis and infection prevention and control.The UK is now one of the first countries outside China to have a prototype specic laboratory test for this new disease.Healthcare professionals who are contacted by a patient with symptoms following travel to Wuhan have been advised to submit samples to PHE for testing.Iniduals will be treated in isolation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The conditions are right to put the ­ision and rancour behind us. For our United Kingdom to be truly united.That will mean Leavers respecting and understanding their opponents’ sorrow. A tall order, perhaps, given the vitriol they have endured, but essential.It will mean the more extreme Remainers ending the abuse — and resisting the temptation to seize triumphantly on any setbacks that now arise. Indeed, it would be better to let the very terms “Leavers” and “Remainers” fall into irrelevance and disuse.Ours is a great country, of course, but one with substantial problems and a deep ­economic ide.The new freedoms over our laws, money, borders and trade — and our powerful new Government — can be catalysts for a vibrant, energetic, prosperous and more harmonious new era where wealth and opportunity are sp evenly across the country.It can be achieved by everyone coming together. By all of us getting behind Britain. That of course includes the millions of EU migrants who have made their lives here, make a vital contribution and must never misconstrue Brexit as a vote against them.Our island nation was simply never a good fit for the EU. We will be better off outside it — and the  other nations may well be too without our opposition holding them back. But it is vital, during this year’s standstill “transition period”, that they grasp what Brexit actually means.The omens for a trade deal look poor. The EU is living in the past, issuing bleak threats asstill dealing with the faint-hearted Theresa May Government and a country racked with self-doubt.It acts asBoris Johnson could even now negate Brexit by locking us into EU rules and ECJ judgments and allowing unfettered access to our fishing waters.But everything changed at the moment of his victory. His Government has a huge mandate and will sign the barest of free trade deals, or none, rather than sacrice ANY sovereignty.We will remain an integral part of the continent of Europe, physically and culturally. We can be the EU’s strongest friend as well as its neighbour. Butour two sides cannot forge a trade deal it will be because of a monumental failure by the EU to recognise the new reality.Boris is determined to extract us entirely from Brussels’ reach.If the EU thinks he’s bluffing it’s mistaken.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t think Brexit will be a miracle but we need democracy back from Brussels.“Brexit has been like an unreliable lover for these past four years. Are we free or not  I think we are now.”While thousands gathered in Parliament Square to mark Brexit, the celebratory mood was felt across the country.There were parties in Oxford, Ipswich, Stoke-on-Trent, York, Hull, Doncaster, Manchester, Liverpool and Plymouth.Excited Brexiteers posted images of themselves across social media — many under the #BrexitDay hashtag.The Union Jack was everywhere — flown in town centres, on strings of bunting and projected on to buildings. Revellers also dressed in Union Jack suits, tops, hats, glasses and even leggings.The atmosphere was buzzing in Boston, where landlord of the Robin Hood Inn, Rob Hancock, , was throwing a party, with free food and Land of Hope And Glory playing at last orders at pm.Rob said: “We are not racist but the town’s changed a lot since . The floodgates opened and we got absolutely overrun.

as Britain thrashes out a new deal with the bloc which will come into play next year.Britain will still have to follow most of the EUs rules and regulations, but we should be free of them by .British citizens wont be EU citizens anymore, but will still be able to benefit from seamless travel throughout the bloc for the next few months.Goods will also continue to be traded freely throughout the UK and the EU for now.For the next  months Brits will be able to travel abroad just as easily as they can now.They will not yet need a visa to travel to EU countries.The European Commission has said that from , travellers will need to apply for an ETIASvisa waiver - much like when visiting America at the moment.ETIAS can be used for up to  days in a period of  days.It will cost roughly £ and be valid for three years - or up to the date of passport expiry.British pets will have the hardest time travelling through the EU and it could take up to  MONTHS to go through the new process.Pet passports will not be valid post- so owners need to contact their vets  month before travel.If you already have a passport, theres no need to worry, it will still be valid until the expiration date - regular rules apply.Brits who do need to renew their passport will be able to get their hands on a blue passport from early .By mid-, all new British passports will be blue.Mobile roaming charges will depend on your network - but most of the big networks have said they will continue to offer free roaming.EE, Vodafone, Three Mobile and O have all confirmed to The Sun that they have no current plans to reintroduce roaming charges.Brits on other networks should still check with their phone company for any extra charges.There is some good news for those facing charges - a new law which protects people from getting huge roaming charges without knowing about it has come into effect.Any charges above £ have to be opted into, so chat to your phone operator about it before your holiday.After , Brits may need to show aor onward ticket when travelling in the EU, as well as enough money for their holiday.There will also be separate lanes for Brits - no more using the EU, EEA and Swiss citizens queues.The pound jumped against the dollar and euro in the biggest three year rally in December as Boris won the election, so its looking good for Brits spending their money in Europe.But, you can never know what will happen to exchange rates tomorrow.The best way to get the most out of your hard earned cash on a European holiday, you should keep an eye on exchange rates in the weeks before you travel.European Health Insurance Cardswill still be valid until December  so Brits can be sure of free or reduced-cost medical treatment in the EU.After the end of the transition period, it depends on what deal Boris strikes with the EU.The governments website says: If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, your EHIC might not be valid anymore.If you do want to drive in Europe after , youll have to get hold of an International Driving Permit.They only cost £. and can be picked up from a post office, but make sure you check which one the country you are visiting requires - there are dferent types.For Brits living in Europe, driving on their UK drivers licence, they will need to be swapped over for a local licence before December , .British expats living where in the EU can stay on in their home country.However, there might be a few administrative hoops they have to jump through depending on what their country asks for.That doesnt mean they will have the same access to move to other EU countries post-.The  million Europeans in the UK can still live here after Friday - but they will need to apply for settled status or pre-settled status by December .The UK will move over to an Australian-style points based system as soon as the transition period ends, meaning hopeful immigrants will have to fulfil certain criteria including education, work background and language skills.After we finally leave, Boris Johnson will face up to the EU to secure a trade deal in the  month transition period.The EU has been dragging their heels, and swearing they cant get a deal done by December .Boris has said in no uncertain terms he will not allow the transition period to be extended beyond December .US President Donald Trump has also signalled hes ready to sign a fantastic new trade deal with the UK.The talks with the US will run at the same time as the UK.Post :Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nearly four years after voters decided by % to % to quit, politicians from all sides called on Leavers and Remainers to set aside their dferences, as the nation immediately entered an -month transition.An hour before Britain’s exit, Boris Johnson, who led the  Vote Leave campaign, said in a pre-recorded TV address: “Tonight we are leaving the European Union.“For many people this is an astonishing moment of hope, a moment they thought would never come, and there are many of course who feel a sense of anxiety and loss. “And then of course there is a third group – perhaps the biggest – who had started to worry that the whole political wrangle would never come to an end.  “I understand all those feelings and our job as the Government – my job – is to bring this country together now and take us forward.”   He added: “When I look at the potential of this country waiting to be unleashed I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success - and whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed. “We have obeyed the people, we have taken back the tools of self-government. “Now is the time to use those tools to unleash the full potential of this brilliant country and to make better the lives of everyone in every corner of our United Kingdom.”Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The choice of which path we take for a post-Brexit Britain now lies before us.“Whatever side we took in the Brexit debate we now need to bring the country together to shape our common future.”  Earlier, the Prime Minister held a symbolic Cabinet meeting in Sunderland - the first city to announce its referendum result after the vote on June , . Later, Mr Johnson flew back to London to host a low-key reception in Downing Street. Guests included Cabinet Ministers, No staff, officials who were involved in the Brexit negotiations and supporters of the battle to leave the EU. They were served English sparkling wine and canapes including fillet of lamb on toast, Shropshire blue cheese, beef and Yorkshire pudding with horseradish sauce, mushrooms tarts and roast chicken skewers.  Mr Johnson gave an eight minute speech to supporters and staff. But Mr Cummings was overcome with emotion, appearing close to tears and rubbing his head and face.After a y pause, he said: Lots of people in this room know what happened. Thankyou. An illuminated clock counting down to pm was projected onto Downing Street. Other buildings in Whitehall were lit up in red, white and blue, including the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, HM Revenue and Customs, the Scotland Office, the Wales Office and the Cabinet Office. But while there were pleas for unity, EU supporters staged protests in Liverpool, Doncaster and Harrogate while Brexiteers in Westminster chanted anti-EU slogans. As Union flags flew in Parliament Square and The Mall, the UK flag was lowered from its pole at the European Council building - formally bringing an end to the UK’s membership.  European Council President Charles Michel, the former PM of Belgium, admitted: “Today is an exceptional day for the European Union and today probably we have mixed feelings. “It’s never a happy moment when someone leaves but we are opening a new chapter, and we will devote all our energy to building a stronger and more ambitious European Union.” EU leaders issued a stark warning that shting away from the bloc’s rules will leave the UK with weakened access to the single market. Mr Michel said: “The more the UK will erge from the EU standards, the less the access to the single market they will have.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen added: “Britain will become a third country, and for all third countries, the following applies - only those who acknowledge the rules of the common market can benefit fully from the common market.” She warned: “We want to have the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom but it will never be as good as membership.”Senior Cabinet Minister Michael Gove admitted trade with the EU would not be “frictionless” after the transition deal ends on December .He said: “We want trade to be as frictionless as possible but the EU is clear, you can only have fully frictionless tradeyou accept all of their rules,you accept all their laws, you are subordinate to their judges, you are subordinate to their political structures.”  The Government wants to strike a trade deal with the EU before the transition period finishes. But ministers also plan to target a pact with the US. American Ambassador to Britain Woody Johnson hailed a “historic day in British history”. “On behalf of the United States Government, I would like to wish the United Kingdom every success as you chart a new path outside of the European Union,” he said. “America shares your optimism and excitement about the many opportunities the future will bring.”  One of the key drivers of the Leave vote was record migration from Europe through EU freedom of movement. Labour leadership hopeful Keir Starmer signalled he will bring back freedom of movementhe becomes PM. Vowing to “make the case” for migration’s benefits and free movement, he said in a speech at Westminster Cathedral Hall: ”I want families to be able to live together, whether that’s in Europe or here, and I want people in this country, in the United Kingdom, to be able to go and study in Europe just as they can now and people in Europe to be able to come and study here.” Asked directlyhe would “bring back” free movement for EU citizens, he told the Mirror: “Yes, of course - bring back, argue for, challenge.” Mr Starmer, who led the Shadow Cabinet battle to push Mr Corbyn towards backing a second referendum, said: “We’ve had the Brexit ide - it’s gone deep. “We’ve now got to win the peace, we’ve got to win what comes next.” Mr Johnson now faces huge pressure to deliver on his  referendum and  election promises. He pledged £million a week extra for the NHS during the Brexit battle and a boost to Britain’s economy from leaving the bloc. During the run-up to December’s general election, he also made a string of promises to the North and Midlands, where voters handed him a thumping Commons majority.But his commitments to the North  and Midlands will be questionedhe scraps the planned HS railway, which will slash journey times and boost capacity between London and Birmingham, and Leeds and Manchester. He is also under pressure to cut net migration, with many Leave supporters opting to quit the bloc so the numbers heading to the UK can be reduced. Latest figures show annual net migration - the dference between the numbers coming to the UK and those leaving each year - running at ,. The PM also faces renewed calls to tackle climate change, having vowed to “lead the global fight against climate change by delivering on our world-leading target of Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by ”.

That historic decision back in June  has ided the nation and will be greeted by a mixture of joy, sadness and relief - but also uncertainty. What does our departure actually mean for our economy, our laws and our place on the world stage  How - and when - will the biggest constitutional change in half a century impact on the lives of you and your loved ones Here we take a look at what Brexit means for you:What has changed   Not much. Although this is the legal moment the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the EU, in practical terms you’ll notice very little dference. That’s because we are in a ‘transition period’ until the end of the year during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules - although we won’t have any say in them as British MEPs have lost their jobs and the UK won’t attend any more summits. It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget. Blue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation.  The UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year. The Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit. A new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner. They’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time. Can the transition period be extended  The Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving. But it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline. We will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years.  The Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time. Any deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS. EU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year. If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. What will Boris Johnson do next  No is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North. He won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity. But with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.  Will our economy be stronger after Brexit   The full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms. EvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU. The Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely.  And what about our place on the world stage  Mr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners. By leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU.For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain.And while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors. If the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Will I still be able to travel to Europe   UK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months. You won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa. You may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. The UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.  WhatI fall ill on holiday   You will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period. After that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. There will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states. A pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed. Butno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.  What will happen to EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for “settled status”, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who haven’t lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for “pre-settled status”, then again for settled status when the hit the five-year mark. After the transition period, new EU migrants will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary.  Will I still get my workersapos rights  The Government will set its own workers’ rights after the transition with many fearing they will be watered down - or dropped entirely. Currently the EU has limits on night work and requirements for daily and weekly rest breaks. It also sets a -hour limit on the working week while giving employees the right to four weeks’ paid annual leave, plus bank holidays. Some expect anti-age discrimination measures to be removed - meaning there will be little or no protection for younger or older workers. Agency workers could be stripped of their right to equal treatment as permanent staff. Ministers have said they will continue maternity rights but there are no guarantees.  What  changes for me from January    You will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming in the EU as the issue will be left to operators. Duty free willon flights and boats to the EU. But there are likely to be some checks on lorries and vehicles crossing the Channel that could lead to delays. There will also be new checks on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms of the Irish backstop. You may also need an international driving permit as well as a ‘green cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance and a GB bumper sticker. Pet owners can carry on bringing their animals to the EU on ‘pet passports’ until December, but after will need to obtain a health certicate. The Supreme Court will be the highest court of appeal in the UK and there will be no direct role for the European Court of Justice in British le.  Is the Union under threat  Boris Johnson has spoken about the “awesome foursome” of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.But Brexit may be the catalyst which breaks up the country, with nationalist sentiment on the rise in Scotland and a steady march towards a reunied Ireland bolstered by the limited border down the Irish Sea. Wales - which backed Brexit - is more integrated with England than the other “celtic” nations. ButScotland goes it alone and prospers then Wales could want to follow a similar path.

Brexit found that almost three quarters of Brits believe the UK is ided, with most thinking it is becoming more so. Weve talked to some of the real people affected up and down the landShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistClaire Donnelly:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsCan Remain and Leave voters overcome their dferences  \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

For millions more, it’s a moment of sadness and uncertainty as we break ties with our continental neighbours. An exclusive poll for the Daily Mirror found that % of us feel the UK is currently ided. While the figure is down from the % who felt Britain was ided last year, schisms in the country are still very much apparent. So also on Friday we relaunch Britain Talks for . Last summer thousands of Remainers and Brexiteers met to talk about big issues and discover what they had in common – you can see the results at britain-talks.mirror This summer, we plan to repeat the experiment, from Friday June  to Sunday June . We’ve partnered with the Jo Cox Foundation’s Great Get Together, and organised our event on the same weekend for maximum impact. The Foundation is named after murdered MP Jo Cox, who said: “We have far more in common than that which ides us.” As the fourth anniversary of the Brexit vote approaches, Britain Talks feels more important than ever. Deltapoll interviewed , and the results also showed % of us think the UK is continuing to “get more ided”, while just % see change happening the other way.  Asked which three issues most ide our country, the biggest is still Brexit, which % of people see as the greatest ider. This is down from % last year, suggesting the issue is becoming less isive. But other issues are continuing to split the nation – wealth , immigrationand left-right politics . As one of our first ever Britain Talks participants, Jon Conor Lyons says there are new isions growing. “After the general election it did feel people were becoming even more entrenched,” he says. “You saw people saying, ‘ you voted this way, you’re an idiot’.  “And here in the north, where the Tories made gains, there is that danger that we’ll see more ision. If we don’t talk about that and find ways to talk about the choices we’ve made, things will become more entrenched.” Catherine Anderson, CEO of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: “It has never been more important than it is today to get Britain talking again. Today emotions will be running high. Some people feeling fearful about the future post-Brexit, others excited. But we are going to have to come together as a country and sooner rather than later. “Britain Talks will play a huge part in that healing process and we’re delighted that it will again go hand-in-hand with the Great Get Together on June - when we remember Jo Cox’s words that we all have ‘more in common than that which ides us’.” What Britain Talks participants said... Jon Conor Lyons, , Student, Labour councillor and Remainer from Manchester, met Ada Pratt, , Tory Brexiter and retired nurse, from Littleborough, Greater Manchester. Jon said: “I didn’t think Ada and I would get to know each other in the way we have. We’ve found a lot in common and we wouldn’t have done that any other way. “A lot of the toxicity comes from social media, where you’ve taken the human element out, you’re just reducing people down to their politics. You have to move past that and see them as a person. They’re not a monster with dferent views than you. They’re not someone you can just dismiss. “People are more than just their politics but the deep isions in our society can stop us seeing that. “I wasn’t sure what we would have in common but there’s a lot. We’re both engaged with politics and we’re both proactive in our communities. It’s challenged the perceptions I had about meeting an older lady from a town. “I’m so glad I got involved.”  Ada added: “Meeting Jon was interesting because of who he is but also because he’s young. It feels like we’re always getting told that old people have ruined everything. But Jon has given me hope for the future. “He was easy to talk to, and he wasn’t bigoted or judgemental. We found out that we’ve come from quite similar backgrounds, from working class families, so we share values in some ways. “Jon was happy to listen, and it made me realise that young people do have a lot to contribute, a lot to say. It wasn’t just talking, it was seeing how his le is, it made it easier to understand what le is like for a lot of his generation. “Church bells might ring out on  January - but we still have plenty to talk about. We need to find ways to move forward as a nation don’t we ”  Abi Reader, , Dairy farmer, from rural south Wales met Sarah King, , a vegan fashion blogger from Bristol. Abi said: “Sarah and I don’t live that far from each other, but our lives couldn’t be more dferent. Taking part was about seeing the bigger picture - discussing the big issues rather than getting stuck in the usual arguments. I think Sarah and I both looked at things from each other’s perspective. “You don’t just bump into people with completely dferent views to yours, you have to make an effort to find them and be ready to listen. It was a big deal to have Sarah visit my farm, it was a really special thing to do. “One of the biggest things I took from the experience was this feeling of pride. I realised how rich my le was. “I’ve not become a vegan - I have salad with my ham and that’s as far as it goes! But I did enjoy listening and talking through some of the issues.”  Sarah responded: “I would like to stay in touch because it was such a positive experience. It was great to meet someone completely out of my normal circle but open to chat, and Abi was so welcoming. To have that chance to communicate was great. “You do see a lot of confrontation on so called debates on TV - where they pit people against each other but there is no real dialogue. The election has made things worse, it’s closed down conversations. It happened so quickly, there was the sudden sht – I’m that team and you’re this team. “There is still a lot to talk about. As veganism becomes more mainstream it’s on the news agenda more but there are lots of tensions within the vegan community, especially around class and race and it would be good to discuss some of these things too. It was interesting to speak to someone who is an authority in their field.” Bob Roberts, , fisherman and business owner, Scarborough, Yorkshire met Razan Alsous, , Syrian refugee and business owner, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. Bob said:: “Meeting Razan certainly made me think - when she explained her story you can’t help but think about why people make a journey like that, what brings people who really are in need of help to the UK. There still has to be a balance but on a human level, talking to Razan you can completely understand why you would flee and how hard it is to start again. “It’s very dferent talking face to face, being with someone. You can’t just dismiss someone’s experiences when they’re sitting there with you. “You’re two humans sitting together, not just two lots of ideas. And you can’t write off someone’s views when you’re sat having a cup of tea. “Meeting Razan confirmed some of my views and gave me a chance to think about some others. I’m still a big believer that immigration policies have to be strengthened. “Brexit is such a dficult issue and for me there are particular ideas we’ve got to discuss. We’ve got a very signicant coastline, that will be right at the forefront of negotiations, and we’ve got to be ready for that.”  Razan said: “Britain Talks was a really good experience for me. I don’t always get to meet people I can talk to about politics, people who might have a dferent idea to me, so meeting Bob was really important. “It was good to hear someone’s real views - someone being honest and direct - instead of just general views, I was getting to hear about things from a new angle. “Talking can help you think about how you see things and also to make decisions - to think more about how you want to do things. Are you deciding for yourself or for others  “Having these debates has to be better for society. And I hope it presented a more positive story about who refugees are to the media. As refugees we aren’t always good at doing that. There’s a lot of bad feeling towards immigrants and refugees and we need to talk about that and where it comes from. “There’s no problem with being dferent or having a dferent point of view than anyone ,we can talk to each other with respect,we can sit down and really listen to each other. “There is a lot we don’t know about each other’s le and we need to find out more so we can find out how we can live together. Because the world is changing, we’ve got to change the model of how we live together and understanding has got to be part of that. “Bob was so nice and respectful, and we did have more in common than we think. Deep down we both want the same things, like most people do.” Stevie Sinclair, , Rangers superfan and thalidomide campaigner met Stephen McBride, , Celtic fan and publican in Glasgow. Stevie said: “It was very worthwhile for me. Yes, we do have a rivalry through football but being a similar age, from a similar generation, we were able to share a lot of football memories too. Steve was very knowledgable, so it was easy to spend time with him. “It’s not every day you’ll see a Celtic and Rangers fan taking a drink together but it was good, we had a lot to talk about and I’m really glad I got the chance to do that. “There is ision everywhere - whether it’s football or the politics, we all have our traditions and views. We need to talk about politics and these things between ourselves, to work out how we make sense of things without things getting silly. “We need to keep talking and meeting - not just talking on social media. You see friends falling out on there. We should be able to share our opinions, embracing things that are dferent, chatting more to more people to find out what people really think, rather than just assuming we know. “Meeting in real le means you can stop things getting heated, have a laugh - humour goes a long way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first job loss brexit confirmed","story":"NewsFirst job loss of Brexit confirmed at exact moment Britain left the EUSteve Barclay, the former Brexit Secretary, is the first man to lose his job over Brexit.

Jubilant Leavers began arriving from mid-morning, singing “Rule Britannia” beneath Winston Churchill’s statue. Some were wrapped in Union flags or dressed in suits made up of the British emblem as they chanted: “What do we want  Brexit! When do we want it  Now!” Clare Fawcett, , a personal assistant from Southampton, said: “It’s bloody amazing, this is the most excited I have ever felt in my le. “I have never looked forward to something as much as this, ever.“There were times I thought it wouldn’t happen and democracy would die. But today, democracy is being delivered. “It makes me very proud to be British.” Clare admitted Brexit was “a leap into the unknown”, but added: “I’m confident the great British people will make this a success.” Demonstrators held placards bearing anti-EU messages including “EU no more”, “Independence Day”, “Lock up the traitors” and “Let’s go WTO” in a reference to the UK reverting to World Trade Organisation rules.Ten Union flags raised by officials fluttered in the breeze, while protesters also waved American flags and chanted “USA! USA!” and “Bye bye, EU”. Foreign TV crews watched in bemusement, while police stood by to prevent trouble flaring. Businessman Jeff Wyatt, , dressed as a crusader and came to Westminster from Milton Keynes, Bucks, to mark Brexit Day. He said of his costume: “It’s purely patriotic symbolism. I’m proud of England and Britain.“I’m not feeling excited, I’m feeling like we are at the end of the beginning. “We have had three-and-a-half years of the Westminster class trying to thwart the decision of the British public. “But we are leaving the tyranny of the EU. This is going to the start of the toppling of the EU. “It’s great to among a big group of Leavers, but the fight definitely isn’t over.”  Retired schoolteacher Andrew Bullock, , said: “It’s a great atmosphere, I’ve been looking forward to happening for months and months. “I thought it was going to happen in March, then in October, but the day has finally arrived. “Lots of people did everything they could to try and stop it. “I knew we would get there eventually but it took a long time coming.”  Banners and supporters for far-right groups were also visible in Parliament Square - with members of the Football Lads Alliance and anti-Islamic political party For Britain joining the celebrations.Despite being just hours from getting what they wanted, namely Brexit, a number of the people in the square were not joyous.Mike, , from Bolton, told the Mirror he was happy Brexit was done but there were still too many foreigners in the country and pedophiles MPs in Parliament."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa rakes 400000 speeches after","story":"w.mantis  Theresa May rakes in £, for speeches after stepping down as PM over Brexit n David Cameron also netted £,

Perry Parsons, , wandered alone amid heavy traffic for  minutes with no-one spotting him leaving. Mum Daisy Hill says her son could have been killed as a result of the blunder and has vowed to send him to a new school. Perry disappeared during the lesson near Fairhouse Community Junior School in Basildon, Essex, yesterday afternoon. Daisy, , said she was hysterical and suffered a panic attack after being told by the school Perry was missing. Struggling to breathe, she opened her front door to join the search only to find herself face-to-face with her son. Daisy posted on social media: Today Fairhouse Primary School lost my six-year-old boy while out of school doing a traffic lesson. Somehow he was able to walk off as he was so upset with keep getting bullied and hit by other pupils. I know he should not have walked off but he is six and should not have been left unattended to be able to wonder off.  She added: He walked all the way from Fairhouse School to Craylands, where I live, on his own across busy roads. Daisy said her son had the presence of mind to use a bridge to cross a dual carriageway in his path. Iaposm in absolute shock this has happened, wrote Daisy. The school gave no reason - just theyaposre going to investigate.  Sorry, not good enough. My son could have died today because Fairhouse Primary School staff are not paying attention. Daisy said her sonaposs journey of a mile took him  minutes and that he arrived home shortly after she was told by the school he was missing. Speaking today, Daisy said: When they phoned I honestly never thought I would see him again. I was hysterical, I had a panic attack as well, and couldnapost breath.  My son has never left my side, really, a proper Mummyaposs boy. Me not knowing where he was and that he wasnapost with an adult was the scariest thing I have ever gone through. I feel emotionally drained today and did not sleep at all last night. The school still hasnapost apologised. Only the woman who informed me he was missing.

Shoppers had rushed to stock up on the anti-bacterial spray after labels claimed the product could kill the human coronavirus - but scientists have warned that it has no evidence.Amazed shoppers claimed they aposhave found a cureapos of the deadly Wuhan virus as they shared images of the cleaning agent on Twitter.The label at the back of the bottle shows: Dettol Anti-Bacterial Surface Cleanser is proven to kill viruses: Influenza - Type A HN, Human Coronavirus and RSV. Some were shocked to the finding as one said: How did they know this before the outbreak   But experts explained that the term aposcoronavirusapos can be attributed to a group of RNA viruses and the recent outbreak is being referred as the Wuhan-strain, according to Plymouth Live.Dr Jonathan Stoye, head of ision of virology, The Francis Crick Institute, states the common cold can also fall under the Coronavirus category, which is most likely what the Dettol labels are referring to, not the fatal Wuhan strain. So perhaps is not the time to start loading up fast on cheap domestic sprays at the supermarket - Dettol in particular.  “It should be made clear that the Wuhan virus is only one of many types of human coronavirus – another is associated with many common colds, Dr Stoye said. Presumably, the cold virus has been tested for sensitivity to Dettol.” Professor Jonathon Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham said: “There are lots of viruses, coronaviruses included, that contain an outer layer made of oils – or lipids to give them their correct term – and this layer is sensitive to the actions of lots of commonly used disinfectants, including soap.  “Whilst these disinfectants would not have been tested directly against the novel coronavirus, the virus will have the same kind of lipids in their outer surface, which can be removed by commonly used disinfectants and soaps. “This is well known and not new.”An expert in disease control at Exeter University said that the coronavirus outbreak should be a matter of concern but not worry or panic for people in the South West. Dr Bharat Pankhania said at all times, not only during outbreaks, good hand hygiene went a long way towards control and reduction in person-to-person spread of infections. “I often observe people in public toilets not washing their hands or not washing and drying them properly. It is no wonder that we have outbreaks,” said Dr Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter’s College of Medicine and Health. The virus, reportedly first spread in Wuhan of central China, has killed  people and infected over , people globally.

He had put the patients in there, murdered them, shut the door and then carried on his consultations and nobody knew. So there I am on day one, I have no computer, and that couch had to go immediately.”  nShipman hid in plain sight, murdering mostly elderly female patients. His killing method was injecting diamorphine, a pharmaceutical heroin. Born in Nottingham in , as a boy he was very close to his domineering mother Vera.  nChillingly given his subsequent killing spree, he was fascinated by how morphine eased Vera’s pain when she was dying from lung cancer.  n  n   nHis mother died aged just  when Shipman was . Determined to become a doctor, he graduated from Leeds School of Medicine in , four years after marrying Primrose Oxtoby, with whom he would have four children. After finishing his training, he joined a practice in Todmorden, West Yorks.  nShipman’s career almost came to an abrupt and early halt. He became addicted to the painkiller Pethidine and was caught forging prescriptions. He left the practice and entered drug rehab, hit with a fine and a conviction for forgery. But the General Medical Council decided no further action should be taken, as did the Home Office.  nShipman was free toto the profession and in  secured a post at the Donneybrook practice in Hyde. He became known as a hardworking, honest GP and in , after more than a decade at Donneybrook, set out on his own, starting up the practice in Market Street.  n  nHe was followed by devoted patients, many of whom would later refuse to believe the man they thought of as a pillar of the community was an angel of death.   nIt was March  when it became apparent Shipman’s elderly patients were dying at a higher rate than expected and in very similar circumstances – usually fully clothed, sitting up in an armchair or reclining on a settee.  nDespite respected members of the community – a funeral director, a taxi driver and another GP, becoming suspicious, a preliminary police investigation said there was no cause for concern.  nShipman’s records appeared to be in order and little wonder, for the doctor had carefully falsied them.  n  nIn the end the family GP would finally be snared by his own greed. In June ,  year-old former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy was discovered dead hours after Shipman visited, leaving relatives perplexed as she had appeared to be in good health.  nThey were further alarmed when they discovered her will had been changed, leaving her whole estate, worth £,, to Shipman.  nThe doctor insisted no autopsy was necessary but Kathleen’s daughter Angela Woodruff refused to accept Dr Shipman’s explanations.  nHer mother’s body was exhumed and a postmortem revealed she died from a morphine overdose administered within three hours of her death.  n  nMatching the time frame in which Shipman had visited her, the doctor’s home was searched and medical records, a strange collection of jewellery and the typewriter used to forge the will were uncovered.  nPolice soon learned the calculating killer had urged many families to get their loved ones cremated to hide his crimes, produced falsied medical notes when questions were raised – and even pretended to call the emergency services in front of relatives only to “cancel” the ambulance after he pronounced the patient dead.  nShipman went on trial at Preston crown court charged with  counts of murder and one count of forgery and was found guilty on all charges. n  nThe disgraced doctor was given a whole le sentence and four years later, he hung himself at Wakefield Prison, aged .  nHe remains the only British doctor ever to be found guilty of murdering his patients.  nThe subsequent Shipman Inquiry looked into how he had got away with killing for so long, and why he had done it. But in the end its chair Dame Janet Smith said: “I think Shipman’s crimes were without motive.  n“The psychiatrists warn me that it is possible that, in Shipman’s own mind, there was a conscious motivation. All I can say is that there is no evidence of any of the features that I have observed, in my experience as a judge, that motivate murderers.”  n  n nWhat is clear is that Shipman’s killing spree shattered trust among his patients in Hyde – which Dr Hannan has been rebuilding.  nThe -year-old GP says: “When the story first broke it was complete disbelief. People said no, you go to your doctor for him to help you, not for him to murder you.  n“This is a deprived area. People here die  years earlier than the national average which is one of the reasons nobody picked up on the excess deaths. It was almost, what do you expect  You live in Hyde.  n“It might not be talked about on the news any more, but it is still very vivid in people’s minds and it causes distress and mental health problems. I am still dealing with the fallout of Shipman to this very day. It doesn’t go away.”  nIYA Crime Widget  nIngrid Brindle was one of Shipman’s patients. “I thought he was an excellent doctor because I had a long-term medical condition and he gave me everything I needed,” she says. “I really thought he was excellent and so did a lot of other people.”  nIt was important for Dr Hannan to regain the trust of his patients. It was one simple act which changed everything. He said: “I remember about three years into the job I was talking to a patient during a consultation and just turned my computer screen round so they could see what I was typing. As I turned that screen around there was a flicker of a smile I had never seen before.”  nFrom then on Dr Hannan, who has moved to the new Haughton Thornley Medical Centre in the town, gave every patient access to their medical records, and ensured that they understood them.  nHe says: “It’s possible Shipman convinced his victims, ‘Well, you’ve got heart disease so that is why I am giving you this morphine’. And they just went along with it, because why would you question a doctor ”  n nTop news stories from n   nEducating and fully informing his patients has become a labour of love for Dr Hannan. As well as providing a practice website full of local and medical information, he’s encouraged all his patients to download one of a range of free NHS recommended apps such as Evergreen Le where they have instant access to their medical records, including everything the doctor has written about them, scan and blood test results and repeat prescriptions.  n“It means my patients can access their GP records at any time of the day or night, wherever they are in the world,” says Dr Hannan. “As soon as my patients leave my surgery today they can read what I have written instantly.”  n  n Anyone affected can find support at the NHS website or contact a GP.  n\",\"published\":\"--T::Z\",\"title\":\"GP who took over Harold Shipmans surgery still dealing with legacy  years on - \",\"url\":\"www.mirror news uk-news gp-who-took-over-harold-\",\"ratings\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Default\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Tesco\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Ian\",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"customer\":\"Terry\"],\"findings\":,\"metadata\":,\"keywords\":[,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],\"analyzed_text\":\"EXCLUSIVE: Dr Amir Hannan took over Harold Shipmans GP surgery and battled to regain patients trust.

He became known as a hardworking, honest GP and in , after more than a decade at Donneybrook, set out on his own, starting up the practice in Market Street. nHe was followed by devoted patients, many of whom would later refuse to believe the man they thought of as a pillar of the community was an angel of death.  nIt was March  when it became apparent Shipman’s elderly patients were dying at a higher rate than expected and in very similar circumstances – usually fully clothed, sitting up in an armchair or reclining on a settee. nDespite respected members of the community – a funeral director, a taxi driver and another GP, becoming suspicious, a preliminary police investigation said there was no cause for concern. nShipman’s records appeared to be in order and little wonder, for the doctor had carefully falsied them. nIn the end the family GP would finally be snared by his own greed. In June ,  year-old former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy was discovered dead hours after Shipman visited, leaving relatives perplexed as she had appeared to be in good health. nThey were further alarmed when they discovered her will had been changed, leaving her whole estate, worth £,, to Shipman. nThe doctor insisted no autopsy was necessary but Kathleen’s daughter Angela Woodruff refused to accept Dr Shipman’s explanations. nHer mother’s body was exhumed and a postmortem revealed she died from a morphine overdose administered within three hours of her death. nMatching the time frame in which Shipman had visited her, the doctor’s home was searched and medical records, a strange collection of jewellery and the typewriter used to forge the will were uncovered. nPolice soon learned the calculating killer had urged many families to get their loved ones cremated to hide his crimes, produced falsied medical notes when questions were raised – and even pretended to call the emergency services in front of relatives only to “cancel” the ambulance after he pronounced the patient dead. nShipman went on trial at Preston crown court charged with  counts of murder and one count of forgery and was found guilty on all charges.  nThe disgraced doctor was given a whole le sentence and four years later, he hung himself at Wakefield Prison, aged . nHe remains the only British doctor ever to be found guilty of murdering his patients. nThe subsequent Shipman Inquiry looked into how he had got away with killing for so long, and why he had done it. But in the end its chair Dame Janet Smith said: “I think Shipman’s crimes were without motive. n“The psychiatrists warn me that it is possible that, in Shipman’s own mind, there was a conscious motivation. All I can say is that there is no evidence of any of the features that I have observed, in my experience as a judge, that motivate murderers.” nWhat is clear is that Shipman’s killing spree shattered trust among his patients in Hyde – which Dr Hannan has been rebuilding. nThe -year-old GP says: “When the story first broke it was complete disbelief. People said no, you go to your doctor for him to help you, not for him to murder you. n“This is a deprived area. People here die  years earlier than the national average which is one of the reasons nobody picked up on the excess deaths. It was almost, what do you expect  You live in Hyde. n“It might not be talked about on the news any more, but it is still very vivid in people’s minds and it causes distress and mental health problems. I am still dealing with the fallout of Shipman to this very day. It doesn’t go away.” n IYA Crime Widget  nIngrid Brindle was one of Shipman’s patients. “I thought he was an excellent doctor because I had a long-term medical condition and he gave me everything I needed,” she says. “I really thought he was excellent and so did a lot of other people.” nIt was important for Dr Hannan to regain the trust of his patients. It was one simple act which changed everything. He said: “I remember about three years into the job I was talking to a patient during a consultation and just turned my computer screen round so they could see what I was typing. As I turned that screen around there was a flicker of a smile I had never seen before.” nFrom then on Dr Hannan, who has moved to the new Haughton Thornley Medical Centre in the town, gave every patient access to their medical records, and ensured that they understood them. nHe says: “It’s possible Shipman convinced his victims, ‘Well, you’ve got heart disease so that is why I am giving you this morphine’. And they just went along with it, because why would you question a doctor ” n Top news stories from nEducating and fully informing his patients has become a labour of love for Dr Hannan. As well as providing a practice website full of local and medical information, he’s encouraged all his patients to download one of a range of free NHS recommended apps such as Evergreen Le where they have instant access to their medical records, including everything the doctor has written about them, scan and blood test results and repeat prescriptions. n“It means my patients can access their GP records at any time of the day or night, wherever they are in the world,” says Dr Hannan. “As soon as my patients leave my surgery today they can read what I have written instantly.”

It was only when he phoned and asked where to send his application that his we realised who used to run the practice. The rookie doctor was stepping into the shoes of Dr Death. It was the surgery in Hyde run by Harold Shipman who murdered around  of his patients, making him the most prolic serial killer in history. The old mill town, seven miles from Manchester, was devastated by the evil doctor’s crimes. He worked and killed there from  until he was caught in , and every resident knew someone whose le had been cruelly cut short by Shipman. It was on January ,  –  years ago today, that he was convicted and jailed for le for murdering  of his patients. Dr Hannan arrived in Hyde nine months later, and was soon all too well aware of what he was letting himself in for. He says: “The day before I started, my we and I were watching TV and it came on the news – they were in  Market Street in Hyde and there were a whole load of elderly men and women all sat on the floor of the waiting room. They were angry, protesting that a new doctor was going to be foisted upon them. I just thought, ‘Oh my God – I am walking into a war zone’. “That gave me my first taste of what was going to come. I arrived to find that Shipman’s we had turned up the night before and taken the computer system away because it had been owned by Shipman.” Giving his new premises a thorough examination, like any good doctor, it was Dr Hannan’s heart which suddenly skipped a beat when he stumbled across the couch on which Shipman had murdered a number of his patients. He says: “There was a side room off the surgery that had the couch in it. He had put the patients in there, murdered them, shut the door and then carried on his consultations and nobody knew. So there I am on day one, I have no computer, and that couch had to go immediately.” Shipman hid in plain sight, murdering mostly elderly female patients. His killing method was injecting diamorphine, a pharmaceutical heroin. Born in Nottingham in , as a boy he was very close to his domineering mother Vera. Chillingly given his subsequent killing spree, he was fascinated by how morphine eased Vera’s pain when she was dying from lung cancer.  His mother died aged just  when Shipman was . Determined to become a doctor, he graduated from Leeds School of Medicine in , four years after marrying Primrose Oxtoby, with whom he would have four children. After finishing his training, he joined a practice in Todmorden, West Yorks. Shipman’s career almost came to an abrupt and early halt. He became addicted to the painkiller Pethidine and was caught forging prescriptions. He left the practice and entered drug rehab, hit with a fine and a conviction for forgery. But the General Medical Council decided no further action should be taken, as did the Home Office. Shipman was free toto the profession and in  secured a post at the Donneybrook practice in Hyde. He became known as a hardworking, honest GP and in , after more than a decade at Donneybrook, set out on his own, starting up the practice in Market Street.  He was followed by devoted patients, many of whom would later refuse to believe the man they thought of as a pillar of the community was an angel of death.  It was March  when it became apparent Shipman’s elderly patients were dying at a higher rate than expected and in very similar circumstances – usually fully clothed, sitting up in an armchair or reclining on a settee. Despite respected members of the community – a funeral director, a taxi driver and another GP, becoming suspicious, a preliminary police investigation said there was no cause for concern. Shipman’s records appeared to be in order and little wonder, for the doctor had carefully falsied them.  In the end the family GP would finally be snared by his own greed. In June ,  year-old former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy was discovered dead hours after Shipman visited, leaving relatives perplexed as she had appeared to be in good health. They were further alarmed when they discovered her will had been changed, leaving her whole estate, worth £,, to Shipman. The doctor insisted no autopsy was necessary but Kathleen’s daughter Angela Woodruff refused to accept Dr Shipman’s explanations. Her mother’s body was exhumed and a postmortem revealed she died from a morphine overdose administered within three hours of her death.  Matching the time frame in which Shipman had visited her, the doctor’s home was searched and medical records, a strange collection of jewellery and the typewriter used to forge the will were uncovered. Police soon learned the calculating killer had urged many families to get their loved ones cremated to hide his crimes, produced falsied medical notes when questions were raised – and even pretended to call the emergency services in front of relatives only to “cancel” the ambulance after he pronounced the patient dead. Shipman went on trial at Preston crown court charged with  counts of murder and one count of forgery and was found guilty on all charges.  The disgraced doctor was given a whole le sentence and four years later, he hung himself at Wakefield Prison, aged . He remains the only British doctor ever to be found guilty of murdering his patients. The subsequent Shipman Inquiry looked into how he had got away with killing for so long, and why he had done it. But in the end its chair Dame Janet Smith said: “I think Shipman’s crimes were without motive. “The psychiatrists warn me that it is possible that, in Shipman’s own mind, there was a conscious motivation. All I can say is that there is no evidence of any of the features that I have observed, in my experience as a judge, that motivate murderers.”  What is clear is that Shipman’s killing spree shattered trust among his patients in Hyde – which Dr Hannan has been rebuilding. The -year-old GP says: “When the story first broke it was complete disbelief. People said no, you go to your doctor for him to help you, not for him to murder you. “This is a deprived area. People here die  years earlier than the national average which is one of the reasons nobody picked up on the excess deaths. It was almost, what do you expect  You live in Hyde. “It might not be talked about on the news any more, but it is still very vivid in people’s minds and it causes distress and mental health problems. I am still dealing with the fallout of Shipman to this very day. It doesn’t go away.” Ingrid Brindle was one of Shipman’s patients. “I thought he was an excellent doctor because I had a long-term medical condition and he gave me everything I needed,” she says. “I really thought he was excellent and so did a lot of other people.” It was important for Dr Hannan to regain the trust of his patients. It was one simple act which changed everything. He said: “I remember about three years into the job I was talking to a patient during a consultation and just turned my computer screen round so they could see what I was typing. As I turned that screen around there was a flicker of a smile I had never seen before.” From then on Dr Hannan, who has moved to the new Haughton Thornley Medical Centre in the town, gave every patient access to their medical records, and ensured that they understood them. He says: “It’s possible Shipman convinced his victims, ‘Well, you’ve got heart disease so that is why I am giving you this morphine’. And they just went along with it, because why would you question a doctor ” "},{"url":null,"title":"half items bought sales waste","story":"w.mantis  Half of items bought in sales are waste of money -

Many will embark on this uncertain journey with optimism, others with trepidation, but everyone realises this is a decisive moment. The immediate task is to secure a new trade deal with the European Union which protects jobs and business. There must be no undermining of environmental and consumer protections or chipping away at hard-won workers’ rights. We also need to strike new trade agreements with dozens of other countries including the United States, Australia, India and Japan.

All the nurses at Acorns make every moment count.”  nNow all the family want for Jude’s third birthday tomorrow is for their local Acorns in Walsall to stay open.  nOne of many hospices across the country threatened with closure as Britain faces an end-of-le care crisis, Acorns’ shortage of NHS funding means it is increasingly reliant on donations and charity shops.  n  nWoman has rare condition that gives her painful blisters inside and outside her body   nSister-in-law of footballer Gabby Agbonlahor launches fundraising plea for brain disease stricken daughter   nIt needs to raise £million to continue to support families across the Black Country.  n“If Acorns closed, we, as a family, would be devastated,” Hayley says. “The hospice doesn’t only support and provide respite for Jude, it provides emotional support for my entire family, especially our other two children.”  n   nAs part of its long-term plan, NHS England has pledged to raise funding for children’s hospices to £million in  , and the Conservative Party pledged to “support our precious hospices” in its election manesto.  nBut hospice and healthcare charity Sue Ryder says this is a “sticking plaster” and that “warm words do not begin to address the underlying problems”.  nThis week Sue Ryder’s chief executive Heidi Travis issued a stark warning: “Without radical reform, UK hospices providing end-of-le care to the ­terminally ill and support to their ­families, cannot survive,” she said. “In short, people who need palliative care will not receive it.”  n  nHeartbroken couple wrongly accused of killing their baby boy can finally grieve for him following inquest   nTravis called for an “urgent, detailed review of funding for the UK’s hospices” and an end to “the postcode lottery of palliative care”.  nA report from Together For Short Lives, a group which represents hospice users, warns of a “children’s palliative care workforce crisis”. It says services are at “breaking point” because of a growing shortage of palliative care doctors and nurses.  nThe report shows there are just  children’s palliative care consultants in the UK when there should be  to . Meanwhile, one in eight nursing jobs in the sector are currently vacant.  nThe Royal College of Nursing recommends there should be around , community children’s nurses in England, but the NHS only has .  n“The children’s palliative care ­workforce is at breaking point,” says Together for Short Lives’ boss Andy Fletcher.  n“Terminally ill children and their families are missing out on the round-the-clock care they need. Services are struggling with a dangerous mix of growing staff shortages and rising ­caseloads.”  nHospices UK says funding for the end-of-le care system as a whole is “broken”. And eight in  charitable hospices surveyed by Hospices UK say they are planning a deficit budget this financial year.  nMeanwhile, Professor David Clark at the University of Glasgow has estimated hospices are currently “propping up the NHS to the tune of £billion in care” every year.  nAcorns supports  children and their families at its Walsall hospice each year, and  in total here and at its other two hospices in Selly Oak, Birmingham, and Worcester. Staff provide day, end-of-le and overnight care, as well as bereavement counselling.  n  nOur beautul daughter lived for an amazing  months - but we always knew weaposd have to bury her   n   nFor Rachel O’Donnell and Jonathon Waring, the hospice is how their family survives. Rachel has multiple sclerosis.  nTheir seven-year-old son, Charlie, suffers from a rare chromosome disorder which means he needs round-the-clock, one-to-one care. Acorns provides the respite care that allows the family to keep looking after Charlie at home.  n“It is exhausting looking after Charlie,” Rachel, , says. “I have MS and some days I find it hard to get out of bed. We had help from the Hospice at Home service, where carers would come in while we had a bit of respite, but due to funding cuts this is no longer available.  n“The overnight respite is when Charlie comes to Acorns. This allows us to spend time with our younger daughter.  n“When I’m hospitalised with my MS, I know they can support us. If it closed it would be impossible for us to travel to Worcester or Birmingham.”  nMark Lyttle and his ex-partner Jen Dalton turned to the Walsall hospice when their three-year-old daughter, Isabella, was diagnosed with cancer. By the time she passed away aged , the hospice had become their second home. “Without Acorns, we wouldn’t be here today,” says Mark, .  n“Jen and myself gave up work to look after Isabella. We were so exhausted, some days I could not even remember my own name.”  n  nBut Acorns’ chief executive Toby Porter says in the past year the hospice faced the “perfect storm”. “We saw a sharp decline in our shop income as well as in donations from big businesses,” he says. “There was uncertainty around Brexit too.”  nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “End of le care is vitally important, and the NHS is committed to caring for people from cradle to grave. Last year the Prime Minister announced a £million cash injection to protect hospices and palliative care services so people across the country will have the best, most personalised and dignied choices when they die.”  nTop news stories from nWhat any new NHS funds will mean in Walsall, is as yet, unclear.  nIn a campaign backed by celebrities including actress Julie Walters and singer Beverley Knight, Acorns has reached a quarter of its £million target. But there is something deeper broken. For the country’s sickest ­children, and for disabled kids who need the most support, austerity remains a daily reality.  nAs Dr Rachel Clarke, palliative care doctor and author of Dear Le, says: “People assume palliative care is NHS-funded, like any other part of medicine.

But there is something deeper broken. For the country’s sickest ­children, and for disabled kids who need the most support, austerity remains a daily reality. nAs Dr Rachel Clarke, palliative care doctor and author of Dear Le, says: “People assume palliative care is NHS-funded, like any other part of medicine. But it is only between %-% of palliative medicine that is NHS-funded. There is no other part of medicine where our ability to provide good care depends on how much the jumble sale raised on Saturday.” n\",\"usage\":,\"warnings\":[\"metadata: page has no

The terrying ft-long creature, an ancestor of the crocodile, was the “T-Rex of its time”, according to researchers. Named dynamosuchus collisensis, it walked on four legs but used its two hind limbs to run, had powerful jaws with blade-like teeth and ­razor-sharp claws that ripped flesh open. The well-preserved remains were found at Agudo in southern Brazil. ­Expedition leader Dr Rodrigo Muller said: “The extremely rare reptile would have been a real bonecrusher from the dawn of the dinosaur era. “Their large teeth were adapted to eat meat. But the bite speed was low, suggesting it was also a scavenger.” The beast’s skull is similar to that of T-Rex, which came almost  million years later. Dr Muller, a biologist at Brazil’s Federal University of Santa Maria, added: “During the late Triassic, while the first dinosaurs were fighting over small prey, dynamosuchus collisensis was probably searching for carcasses or easy to catch animals, like today’s vultures and hyenas do.  “Some palaeontologists say T-Rex did the same. It also had a good sense of smell, and was probably slow. So both occupied a similar role.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grandfather who burned crying baby","story":"w.mantis  Grandfather who burned crying baby grandson to death in stove jailed for  yearsAlexander Miyagashev threw the -month-old boy into stove after his we complained of the crying while they were babysitting the child at their home in RussiaA grandfather who burned his crying grandson alive in a stove has been locked up for  years.  nThe boyaposs grandmother was handed nine years in prison for the -month-oldaposs death by a Russian court.  nThe court heard horric evidence that little Maxim Sagalakov’s crying had annoyed drunk grandma Zhanna Miyagasheva, , and she aposstarted to suffocate the boy until he was silentapos.  nHer husband Alexander Miyagashev, , then took the helpless boy and placed him in the burning stove of the familyaposs house in Kharoy village in Khakassia region.  nTheir daughter Viktoria Sagalakova, , ed to find the child’s charred remains in the stove.  n  n   nFirst job loss of Brexit confirmed at exact moment Britain left the EU n Coronavirus death toll soars to  after medics confirm spate of new fatalities   nSenior prosecutor Maxim Rodionov told the court forensic analysis aposreliably established that the death of the child occurred precisely because of the actions of Alexander Miyagashev, since he placed him in the furnace and burned the boyapos.  nThe child died aposfrom  per cent burns to the bodyapos and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning.  nSentencing the couple, judge Viktor Galimov said: The forensic expert explained that before being placed in the stove the child had a heartbeat.  n“He was breathing, with a normal body temperature.  n“That is, there were signs of le.  n  nThe court heard that the grandfather had burned alive puppies and a cat.  nIn court, the we and husband each blamed the other for the appalling crime.  n“I was heavily asleep,” said the grandmother.  n“How could I do this with my beloved grandson   n“People say grandchildren are sweeter than children.  n“The last time I saw him was alive and well ...  n  nAlexander denied putting the baby in the stove and told the judge: Your Honour, I did not kill.

The boyaposs grandmother was handed nine years in prison for the -month-oldaposs death by a Russian court. The court heard horric evidence that little Maxim Sagalakov’s crying had annoyed drunk grandma Zhanna Miyagasheva, , and she aposstarted to suffocate the boy until he was silentapos. Her husband Alexander Miyagashev, , then took the helpless boy and placed him in the burning stove of the familyaposs house in Kharoy village in Khakassia region. Their daughter Viktoria Sagalakova, , ed to find the child’s charred remains in the stove. Senior prosecutor Maxim Rodionov told the court forensic analysis aposreliably established that the death of the child occurred precisely because of the actions of Alexander Miyagashev, since he placed him in the furnace and burned the boyapos. The child died aposfrom  per cent burns to the bodyapos and exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning. Sentencing the couple, judge Viktor Galimov said: The forensic expert explained that before being placed in the stove the child had a heartbeat. “He was breathing, with a normal body temperature. “That is, there were signs of le.  The court heard that the grandfather had burned alive puppies and a cat. In court, the we and husband each blamed the other for the appalling crime. “I was heavily asleep,” said the grandmother. “How could I do this with my beloved grandson  “People say grandchildren are sweeter than children. “The last time I saw him was alive and well ...  Alexander denied putting the baby in the stove and told the judge: Your Honour, I did not kill. She killed. “I smoked, went to sleep, then ent to the toilet. She told me: ‘I killed our grandson’.” Neighbour Evgeniy Borgoyakov told Russian television the grandfather had “turned mad from alcohol”. He said: “We hear he pushed the baby into the wood-burning stove. “That was it.”  Other neighbours said that the couple often looked after the child and previously took good care of him. The mother who was in court said she could not believe her parents had killed her child. Reports said she planned to appeal the sentence. After his death one year ago she posted an emotional message on social media. “Rest in peace, my beloved son,” she wrote.

And a home win over Dunfermline shows their form in Inverclyde is just as good as it’s ever been.Morton finding their feet both home and away makes what is always a dficult trip an even stfer test for Dundee.Win and their quest for consistency starts anew – lose and the Dee and McPake could be staring down the barrel."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/5e32a193a66212.99925684-558x372.jpg ","title":"exclusive dundee city council worker sacked over email tampering claims","story":"A high-profile Dundee City Council education officer has been sacked over claims he sent a ‘falsied email’ during the tendering process for a £, local authority contract.Kenny Christie, education support officer for arts and culture with the council, was hauled in front of council chiefs earlier this month over claims he interfered in the tendering process to provide sound technology for Dundee Schools Musical Theatrefor three shows last summer.Mr Christie, who worked for the council for the past  years, has strenuously denied the allegations and has confirmed he will be appealing against the decision.He was previously director with DSMT but has since left the company, which is funded by the council.The allegations centre on Blue Parrot Production and Events, based in Edinburgh.It is understood Blue Parrot missed the tender deadline for the DSMT contract and, when an email from the company was forwarded to the tender team, the date had been tampered with to make it look like it had been submitted on time.But Mr Christie has denied all links to the scandal and said: “I received a letter from Dundee City Council today, January .“I can confirm that I am not currently working for Dundee City Council in any capacity.“I have been removed from my post.“The council has accused me of deliberately forwarding a falsied email. There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.49866271-240x180.jpg

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

McLean levelled the score just before halftime turning a corner by Aitken into the net.The second half was competitive with two well matched teams working hard in the gusty conditions. Star took the lead when McMurchy chased down a long ball, before turning into the box and being upended with Aitken scoring the resulting penalty.The game remained close as Busby chased an equaliser but with a few minutes left Caskie collected the ball near the corner, drove into the box and his cross allowed McLean to add his second for a - win."},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"motorists-bus-passengers-face-delays-a7-set-weekend-closure","story":"MOTORISTS face y detours this weekend as the A will be closed from Friday evening outside Selkirk.And bus passengers in the town will need to use a shuttle service to reach the X -

Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask.

Our social services, nursing homes, hospitality, and agricultural industries have benefited hugely from the influx of talented and industrious Europeans, our young people have benefited equally from being part of the humanistic outlook of the European Union. So what next for us here in Scotland, a land of hope and glory, do we think Frankly, for my children and grandchildren hope is not enough and none of them, as far as I can tell, have the remotest interest in personal glory ndash much to their credit. Of course, the \"glory\" referred to in Elgar and Bensons song is shorthand for the vainglorious notions of the British ruling classes, underpinned by a Ruritanian monarchy and the English public school ethos of arrogance and conceit, which has played such a large part in the lives of two of our recent Eton-educated Prime Ministers and many more before them. The Bullingdon club didnt just happen by accident, it happened for a reason.Land of hope and glory, mother of the free indeed. No glory and no freedom for a people manipulated by a coterie of newspaper barons on behalf of a decaying social and economic elite.John Jamieson, Ayr.AS the EU Parliament sang Auld Lang Syne on the UKs leaving, it is apt and symbolic that they sang in Scots, not English.We Scots willand take up where we voted to remain but were denied by the Westminster Parliament.The cup orsquo kindness will be taken again when we haste back with ceud mile failte.Aye tae the EU.John Edgar, Kilmaurs.WHAT irony. MEPs choose Auld Lang Syne composed by Rabbie Burns and whose birthday we have just celebrated, to mark their sadness at the departure of the UK from the EU. A poignant reminder that an overwhelming proportion of Scots chose to remain.And all the Brexit Party can find to do is to wave Union Jacks in an act of petty triumphalism. Shame on them.Trevor Rigg, Edinburgh EH.EUROPE: today is not adieu, its au revoir.Colin Campbell, Kilbarchan.I WATCHED, shocked, with the rest of the nation as our gallant MEPs spent their last day in Brussels wringing their hands and with copious tears.Poor souls, I reflected, they are bereft at losing a treasured job ndash and what a job.With a salary of pound, plus a staff allowance of pound, year , an attendance allowance of pound,  and general expenses of pound, our poor old MEPs are giving up pound, per year.What a solid gold gravy train ndash its no wonder the SNP would like Scotland to join the EU. I can see the queues forming outside Holyrood as we speak ndash and given my annual pension of pound, you might see me in one.Mike Weber, Peebles.BREXIT Day is a day for real celebration, marking our leaving the EU. Its what we voted for more than three years ago but it has been a long slog of democratic complications and political mayhem in getting there.Despite the doom and gloom merchants continuing to spread their nonsense as to our future we can now rejoice in being free from the shackles of Brussels and the endless legislation pouring out of the EU with UK MEPs living a le of millionaires compliments of the poor taxpayer.One thing that is crystal clear: we should never subject our sovereign freedom to such ridiculous conditions ever again.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen AB.YOUR correspondent Jacqui Mairmust indeed be madshe thinks that Brexit means that she and others will not in future still be able to take nice holidays in Portugal and meet nice Spanish-speaking, Don-Quixote-singing ladies thereby.To my best knowledge the European Union was not established for that precise purpose, although that may have been a happy concomitant, and likewise our departure does not mean an end to enjoyable foreign sorties.Darrell Desbrow, Dalbeattie.WE may no longer be a member of the EU, but we should keep the EU flag flying here because it is through no fault of Scotland that we have been dragged out of the European Union . Those who complain about the use of the EU flag should perhaps remember that Scotland voted emphatically to remain within the European Union and the fact that we are now no longer in it is what we should really be complaining about.I find it ironic that those who rattle off complaints about Scotlands hospitals, schools and so on under the SNP ignore the fact that health spending in Scotland is pound per person higher than in England, that Scotlands AE services are the best in the UK, and Scotland has the highest number of GPs per head of population in the UK while more than  schools have been upgraded over the last ten years and Scotland provides the best package of support for students in the UK. And while police numbers in England and Wales were cut, Scotlands number of officers has increased with recorded crime down  per cent since the SNP came to power. So, although challenges remain, and while things are not perfect and never will be, the SNP flies the flag for Scotland now the focus has to be on ensuring that Scotlands flag will fly in Europe.Ruth Marr, Stirling.IF the First Minister must put the vex in vexillologyby debating the post-Brexit flying of the EU flag over the Scottish Parliament, then perhaps she should step down. Her replacement could then focus on, among other things, declining education standards, rising drug deaths and the multitude of problems with the NHS.Otto Inglis, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackays commentaryshould give us all much food for thought. However, there is at least one very important issue which he neglects to explore. This the fact that in the two respective referendums No voters were the winners and Remain voters were the losers.There is a signicant dference between being an ousted majorityand being a minority which is naturally disappointed at the outcome of the  vote. By extension, allowing the normal outcome of referendums is a simple and logical remedy for both sets of voters: the majority view prevails and the minority accepts that in a democracy, you sometimes lose the vote evenyou sincerely believe you won the argument.Moreover, it would also surely have been better to seek consensus around the outcomes of both referendums. It is mark of the failure of our leaders of all parties and at both Westminster and Holyrood that there is no such progress over the past five years. But even Boris Johnson has now declared \"let the healing begin,\" and although he may not succeed, surely that intention is preferable to the position of Nicola Sturgeon, who has wilfully led Scotland further and further down the road of ision and bitterness.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.SO Derek Mackay laments the potential loss of pound billion of exports to the EU but is happy to sacrice poundbn of exports to the rest of the UK under an independent Scotland . So much for having the interests of Scotland at heart.Bill Eadie, Gfnock.YET again the Scottish Parliament has demanded another independence referendum .

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle. The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles.

Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point. In Scotland, a further pound cash-back is available from Energy Saving Trust , reducing the cost further and in some installations covering the cost completely. To access the grants and extended three year warranty you must use an approved installer and check that like Jorro, they are approved by both OLEV and EST.The smallest fast charger on the market, which is smaller than an A piece of paper, EO Mini Pro is proving very popular for those looking for a discreet solution.Did you know Jorro offer charge points that can charge the car for free  If you have Solar Panels you can use the generated electricity to power the car with a Zappi Charge Point. Even in Scotland a typical Solar PV System can provide more than  miles of range per day.Some drivers may not have a convenient place to charge at home so installing charge points at work may be the solution with businesses able to claim up to pound, in grant funding to install charging for staff.

Therefore she - not the cause - is the problem, and needs to go by the spring.Expect more unease to bubble up.Instead of the exciting campaign the Yes movement wants, Ms Sturgeon extolled the duller virtues of caution, patience and realism.There will be no wildcat referendum, regardless of legality.And nor will there be any attempt - for now - to get a legal ruling on whether a consultative referendum can be held with Holyroodrsquos existing powers, thus bypassing Westminster.Ms Sturgeon didnrsquot rule out a legal route, but had little enthusiasm for it.ldquoIt could move us forward - but equally it could set us back, she said.Her official spokesman later said it was ldquonot something shersquos seeking to do anytime soon.

She would do thatthe time came.Only this month, SNP Brexit Secretary Mike Russell claimed the Scottish Government had ldquomany options to deliver Indyref, it just didnrsquot ldquowant to go into them.ldquoAs we move forward, they will all become clear, he said coyly.Well now the time has come, and itrsquos quite clear there is no new plan, only the same old plan - hoping the hard grind of campaigning will be rewarded.It is a position that risks angering her own side over lack of progress, while still giving her opponents enough ammo to say she remains obsessed about the constitution at the expense of failing public services.It is a tough sell all round as she heads towards an election year.Perhaps, after the  Holyrood poll, and despite there being nothing in it for him, Mr Johnson will help out and suddenly concede Indyref.But for now, Ms Sturgeon and her increasingly fractious party are back to pushing the same boulder uphill."},{"url":null,"title":"greens-launch-campaign-secure-scottish-independence","story":"At a rally in Glasgow on Friday, the Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie looked to drum up support for the cause, on the back of a speech by Nicola Sturgeon in which she pledged to \"ramp up\" campaign efforts.Mr Harvie said he would like to see a referendum on independence before the Brexit transition period ends in December.He said: \"I think its important that we do continue to assert the right of Scotland to make a decision along the timescale of the transition period.\"Every member state has had a say, the UK has had a say, Scotland has tried to have a say and been ignored.\"Mr Harvie accused the UK Government of not listening to the will of the Scottish people, not only in the  referendum in which Scots voted to Remain, but in the negotiations with Brussels on what the future relationship with the EU will look like.He said: \"I think theres a principled argument for, during the transition period - which means this year - thats when Scotland should have the right to decide.\"Mr Harvie said he believes Westminsters position to refuse a second independence ballot will backfire.He said: \"I think the longer the UK digs its heels in and says naw you cannae, the more likely people will be to say Yes we will.\"If you think about it this way,the Brexiteers were told by the European Union they werent allowed to have a referendum about , I think that would have made a lot of people who already supported that even more determined and it would have pushed people in the middle in the direction of saying they dont want to be a part of something thats telling us what we can and cant do.\"In her speech earlier on Friday, Ms Sturgeon tried to steer SNP members away from a consultative, non-binding referendum towards the legal route - which would include a request for powers to hold a vote to be granted by the Prime Minister.But she did not rule out a consultative vote entirely.Mr Harvie also dampened the prospects of a non-binding vote, saying: \"I dont think anyone should be rushing towards that as an option.\"I think its far betterwe can have this choice on a democratic basis without going to court, because I think thats the best way to make sure both sides of the argument accept the rules and the legitimacy of the outcome.\"If at some point it becomes utterly impossible and the UK becomes intransigent even after , well possibly you might have to look at that.\"But its by no means an option we should be enthusiastic about.\"Mr Harvie pointed to recent pro-independence majorities at Holyrood and among Scottish MPs at Westminster as a mandate for a second vote.He said: \"I dont see that changing, I see that getting stronger. I think that the UK will recognise at some point that theyre only going to lose the argument more quicklythey just keep saying were not allowed to have a say.\"Meanwhile, aleading MEP has said it would be \"stupid\"the EU does not allow an independent Scotland to re-enter the bloc.Ska Keller, co-president of the European Greens in Brussels, claimed her group would work to make sure Scotland could be re-admitted \"swtly\"Scots vote to become independent.At the launch of the Scottish Greens independence campaign in Glasgow on Friday, Ms Keller also said Scotland meets the criteria to permit re-admission - rubbishing claims the countrys deficit would hinder accession to the EU.Green MEP Ms Keller said: \"This is something thats being discussed across the European Parliament, of course we have the new EU Scotland friendship group that has been established.\"I cant speak for other groups or parties, but for us Greens its a very important thing.\"Obviously its up to the people of Scotland to decide on their future.\"The only thing were saying is that we would do everything we can to allow for a swt .\"Scotland fulfils all the normal accession criteria, has all the European rules and regulations, so there is really no need for y discussions and negotiations.\"This is a case of a country wanting to rejoin and I think it would be politically so stupid to then close the doors of that, and I hope that all the member states will see that - and Im also quite confident that they will see that.\"She maintained Scotland would be able to get back into the EU despite its current % deficit, adding: \"There are so many countries who have so much of a deficit who are inside and thats not a problem.\"Opponents of independence have said accession to the European Union would only be granted to nations which have a deficit of % or lower.But Ms Keller said this is only for access to the European currency, which First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not seek to use.Ms Keller said there is \"a lot of sympathy\" among European countries for Scotland - where % of people voted to remain in the EU in .She added that sympathy would have to translate into \"political action\" for Scotland to be welcomed back into the EU."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10971644.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgows-iconic-duke-wellington-statue-gets-eu-makeover-brexit-day","story":"The statue, a city icon known for having a traffic cone placed on top, replaced the usual orange and white for an EU flag.:New dawn for UK but countryrsquos isions remainIt comes just hours before Britain officially leaves the European Union at pm tonight.Members of the public stopped to view the decoration on the Duke - located outside the Gallery of Modern Art in the citys Royal Exchange Square - and take pictures.The statue of the former prime minister has for years been targeted by students and revellers who put an orange traffic cone on his head, and it has become part of the citys landscape.Plans in  to raise the statue to stop cones being placed on its head were withdrawn after a public outcry.:lsquoTime is extremely, extremely shortrsquoGlasgow voted by .% to remain in the  referendum.The Glasgow Times reported how pro-EU campaigners will gather at the Donald Dewar statue on Buchanan Street at .pm on Friday as part of a series of events marking the day."},{"url":null,"title":"landowners-snub-new-research-calling-drastic-cull-deer","story":"A new report has said that up to one million wild dear, nearly double previous estimates, could be roaming the country, damaging the landscape and hampering environmental efforts.The findings, published by the Deer Working Group , is urging Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control deer numbers in order to protect their lucrative hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls.Yesterday, landowners criticised the recommendations, saying the report came in sharp contrast to similar research by Scottish Natural Heritage published just two months earlier.The body that represents rural businesses and landowners, Scottish Land and Estates , also insisted conflicting evidence on the future of deer management in Scotland should not overshadow the recent progress achieved.It maintained that the issue was not about overall deer numbers but about their impact on local areas.Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of the SLE, said: ldquoSubstantial progress has been made in the operation of deer management groups over the past five years, with the sector demonstrating its ability to respond and adapt to new challenges and manage deer in a way that is sustainable and safeguards public interests.ldquoThe DWG report provides  recommendations, a number of which will be welcomed by those involved in managing deer. However, given the substantial nature of the report, further scrutiny will be required over the coming weeks.The report recommends the maximum average density of deer across Scotland should be capped at  per square kilometre, and says densities often need to be much lower in some sensitive or over-grazed areas.Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay Perthshire have red deer densities above  per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between  and  per square kilometre.The report endorses SNHrsquos identication of the need for signicant changes in deer management as an important issue in climate crisis mitigation measures, and recommends that it is addressed as a priority.Conservationists argue that red deer, who often roam in vast herds, prevent woodland and shrubs from naturally regenerating.Ms Laing added: ldquoWhat is clear is the strong focus on drastically reducing the deer population. This conflicts sharply with the SNH report, published just two months ago, which found the red deer population had already dropped considerably to below  per sq km - and around % of the population culled annually.ldquoWhile deer numbers are important in setting culls it has been accepted by SNH for many years that it is grazing impacts rather than numbers that are critical in setting and meeting habitat objectives.ldquoAny discussion on deer numbers and their impact on the environment is therefore likely to be misleadingnot considered along with the grazing impacts of other herbivores. The right density is also dependent on pasture availability rather than a strict number applicable across every region.\"The DWG reportrsquos authors also want to see a removal of the ban on night sights being used to hunt deer and a relaxation of the restrictions in place around night shooting.Members of Scottish Environment Link - a network of environmental and recreation groups - have welcome the report, but the Association of Deer Management Groups said the proposals would have a ldquodevastating effect on an important rural industry for Scotland.Mike Daniels, head of land management at the John Muir Trust which aims to conserve wild places, praised the ldquocourage and clarity of the report, saying it confirmed that Scotlandrsquos existing deer management procedures needed ldquomajor reform. SNH said it was considering the recommendations of the report.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe appreciate all the hard work behind this signicant report, and look forward to working with the Scottish government and other stakeholders to improve the way deer are managed in Scotland.Roseanna Cunningham, the Scottish environment secretary, said she needed to reflect and would consult widely before deciding what action the government should take. It was an ldquoimportant and complex issue, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"islanders-vote-bay-harris-community-buyout-plan","story":"Seven years in the making, the Bays of Harris Estate buyout would include the isle of Berneray for an anticipated price tag of over poundmillion, y negotiations have taken place between landlords ndash the Hitchcock family ndash and the community steering group, which is chaired by John Maher, former drummer with The Buzzcocks, which rose to fame in the s.Now, a final business plan is being produced and a feasibility study, originally drawn up in , is being updated after the Scottish Land Fund granted the buyout group pound, funding.Three meetings to update the community have been held in Leverburgh, the Bays of Harris and Berneray where  people, almost half of the island population of , turned out this week.Mr Maher, chairman of the Bays of Harris Steering Group, said that now more information has been confirmed about the estatersquos income more people are supporting the plan.He said: ldquoI have seen a sht of opinion, some people still say no, leave it as it is, but people have read the information now and there is a sense of shting to yes.ldquoThe ones that were maybe on the fence I think we have kind of made it clear to them that there is a better futurewe go for the buyout, as opposed to leaving it as it is, especially when you see estates on either side of us, the North Harris Trust and the West Harris Trust,and what they have achieved.The population of West Harris has increased in the last decade as the community managers have safeguarded affordable housing plots for people living and working in the area.Mr Maher said the Bays of Harris group believed that income from the estate there could also be used to aid affordable housing for locals, something which had been high on the wish list of islanders at recent public meetings.He added that the landowner had now agreed to include previously protected income streamsit was sold to the community, making the proposal much more viable.Mr Maher said: ldquoIt does generate a signicant amount of income, it can be up to six figures in a year, there are BT telephone masts, police transmitters and Vodaphone, a couple of fish farm rentals, income from the electricity board wayleaves over land and croft rents.ldquoLots of people have mentioned the issue of affordable housing, there is a high percentage of second homes and holiday homes and when a house comes up for sale itrsquos often going to somebody off the island.The community can see lots of other opportunities to invest the income in, including tourism projects in response to the increase in camper vans visiting the islands.Only residents who are on the electoral roll will be eligible to vote in the ballot which, including  and  year olds, will go out to about  people.Mr Maher said: ldquoCommunity ownership of the Bays of Harris estate offers a potentially vital opportunity to safeguard the future of our community.ldquoThe updated feasibility report will provide a rigorous assessment of the viability of the estate under community ownership and enable the community to make an informed decision about the merits of a buyout. He said the business plan was due to be completed by the end of March, with ballot papers going out at the end of April. Islanders will have around two weeks to cast their vote.He added: The landowner has agreed to a community buyout onlythat is what the majority of islanders want.

After Members of the European Parliament voted to back the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, they sang Auld Lang Syne, Robert Burns’ version of an old Scottish folk song about friendship, as a way to bid goodbye to the United Kingdom.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted George Eliot, saying “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love”, and told the UK that “we will always love you and we will never be far”. Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “It’s sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us so much: culturally, economically, politically, even its own blood, in two world wars. It’s sad to see the country leaving that liberated Europe twice.”The outpouring of goodwill was palpable and obviously genuine.: Watch: MEPs belt out Auld Lang Syne as European Parliament backs Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament bodyIn contrast, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed the hope that the UK’s departure would be the beginning of the end for the EU. “It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti-democratic,” he claimed, ignoring the fact that Britain was leaving as a result of a democratic process.The vision of the world espoused by Farage, Donald Trump and other members of what some call the alt-right and others view as the far-right is of entirely separate nations in a state of constant struggle. So Trump, the US President who puts ‘America first’, makes trade war on countries who dare to act in their own interests. After France planned a new tax on tech giants, who pay infamously little, Trump threatened vast tarfs on its goods.If the EU collapsed and populist leaders in the Trumpian mould emerged across the continent, all promising to put one over rival countries with dferent agendas, how long would it be before those trade wars turned into something more serious The EU has helped keep the peace in Europe for a letime after millions died in two horrendous world wars. And the fact that the UK and Ireland were both members meant those who were prepared to commit murder in Northern Ireland’s Troubles began to look as foolish as they were callous and brutal.There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the EU and it should take Brexit as a sign of the need for reform. But it is of profound regret that the UK is leaving and The Scotsman wishes our “auld acquaintance” all the very best.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brussels left wondering why uk pressed brexit ejector seat chris mccall","story":"There is genuine regret in Brussels that Brexit is happening, but that doesn#t mean the EU will go easy in trade talks, writes Chris McCallThe Berlaymont building is a landmark that many Scots will instinctively recognise, but few could name. It is a familiar backdrop beloved by broadcast journalists, used in countless TV reports stretching back decades. It has become a visual shorthand for Brussels and everything it represents.This gigantic slab of late s modernity is the home of the European Commission – the executive wing of the European Union – and the beating heart of the entire European project.The Berlaymont may lack the gothic grandeur of Westminster or the design flourishes of Holyrood, but remains an impressive sight. The complex gives off an air of quiet authority – much like the hundreds of civil servants who work across its  floors.It was opened six years before the UK joined what was then called the European Community and it will stand long after Brexit is finalised.: How Scotland learned to love the European UnionWhen I visited for the first time last week, as a guest of the now-closed European Commission office in Scotland, the Brexit train had long since departed the . The UK was coming out of the EU and everyone I spoke to accepted that fact.No one naively believed that perhaps the whole thing could still be called off. Instead, there was a calm anticipation of what now lies ahead –  months of intensive negotiations on everything from security arrangements to fishing rights.If prizes were awarded for political deal-making, then the EU’s trophy cabinet would be bulging. You can’t forge a -state alliance without learning a trick or two when it comes to sitting round a conference table.Reaching agreements on incredibly complex issues is what the EU does. But that doesn’t mean it’s looking to give the UK a kicking for daring to rip up its membership card. A sense of sadness hung over the Berlaymont. Collectively, no-one doubts the EU will get the job done, and that the institution will continue to thrive, come what may. But inidually there is genuine regret that Brexit is happening. “A great shame,” was a phrase I heard more than once when the subject of the UK’s departure was raised.Those who work in Berlaymont believe, fundamentally, that the EU is a force for good. Member states might disagree on the route, but they all agree on the destination – peace and prosperity across the continent.They knew the UK had complaints about certain things. But it was presumed they could be worked out, in time.

A request for a transfer of power, through a section  order was made by Ms Sturgeon last monthin the aftermath of the SNPs landslide election victory north of the border. But it was swtly rejected by Boris Johnson a few weeks later. The Scottish constitutional convention of the s was the driving force behind the creation of the Scottish Parliament and Ms Sturgeon set out plans for a similar body to help build the case for independence.\"We will invite Scotland elected representatives - MSPs, MPs, the MEPs elected last year and council leaders – to come together to endorse a modern Claim of Right for Scotland through a new Constitutional Convention,\" Ms Sturgeon revealed.\"To declare that it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether and when there should be an independence choice and build support for that principle amongst civic Scotland.\"The Scottish Government has already begun work on a new new case for independence, in the same vein as the Scotlands Future document publish ahead of the  vote.This will ensure Scots have the information they need to \"make informed choices about the future of the country\", Ms Sturgeon added.\"In the coming months, the Scottish Government will publish the outcome of that work,\" she said.The “New Scotland” series of papers” will seek to provide the information and answers people want.\"They will provide detail on how Scotland can make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\"But Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon was seeking to keep the \"isive debate going\" in Scotland.\"Nicola Sturgeon’s determination to plough on with preparations for another vote on independence is predictable, depressing and entirely wrong-headed,\" Mr Carlaw said.“People across Scotland are sick and tired of her relentless pursuit of a referendum they simply don’t want.“What people do want is action now to improve education, health, policing and all the other services they rely upon.“On the day we leave the EU they want a government which focuses on Scotlands economy and jobs.“And they want Nicola Sturgeon to put her referendum plans where they belong – firmly on the backburner.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: teh speech was designed to distract from the SNP’s \"catastrophic failings\" in government.“It is sickening that Nicola Sturgeon is willing to neglect struggling schools and hospitals, and waste even more public money on her never-ending campaign to ide the people of Scotland. She even failed to rule out a Catalan-style ‘consultative’ referendum that would result in an expensive legal battle,\" she said.The decision to allow the Electoral Commission test the question comes after concerns that it may be advantageous to the pro-independence campaign. Although the watchdog tested the question ahead of the last referendum, subsequent research saw it reject a Yes No approach for the  Brexit referendum on the basis that this could sway the outcome in favour of the positive \"yes\" response. Instead voters had a \"Remain or Leave\" option in the EU vote.Ms Sturgeon said the current question is \"simple, intelligible and well recognised across the country.\"But she added: \"Parliament made clear it wanted it re-tested and it is the next practical step we need to take within our powers to prepare for a referendum.\"Ms Sturgeon said the UK Governments rejection of another independence referendum is \"a sign of weakness, not of strength\".She said: \"If they had any confidence in the argument for the Westminster union, they would have no problem with the people of Scotland having the right to choose.\"It is the fear of defeat that is making them so desperate to deny us the choice. We should draw encouragement from that.\"The SNP will double their campaign budget to push for a second vote, according to the First Minister - but she urged activists to listen to people who are against independence.She said: \"Our party campaign is therefore ready to ramp up. We aim to double the SNP campaign budget this year to support new independence materials, local newspaper adverts and a new campaign film focused on undecided voters.\"It is vital that as we campaign we listen and engage respectfully.\"There are many people out there who voted No in  now thinking about independence dferently in light of Brexit.\"We must show that we understand the complexity of the issues they grapple with and that, for many, emotions will be mixed.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"beers over brexit life goes on say belfast pub goers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In , business is still coming to terms with the result and its impact. There is an overriding sense of dismay at the situation we find ourselves in. While NI Chamber and others have been working hard to ensure the best deal for business, as the transition period begins, uncertainty about trade and export has not been addressed and companies remain in the dark on too many crucial issues.Mark O’Connell, Chief executive, OCO GlobalNI in good position to take advantageMark O’Connell, Chief executive, OCO GlobalThen: I thought it was a bad idea in , and the intervening period had hardened my views. But you have to look at it from dferent perspectives. From the hard Right Brexiteer who felt left behind and blames immigration and European integration for their hardships then it promises a new dawn, while for the liberal elite establishment of the UK - intellectuals, artists and business leaders - it isolates and damages Britains voice and influence in the world and access to EU funding in RD and cultural collaboration.Now: Most UK business lobby groups are relieved that our internal argument is coming to an end and the uncertainty that has stled investment decisions may soon be over. Few international companies are enthused about Brexit and many have already voted with their feet and stalled investment or relocated. Northern Ireland is potentially in a very good position to take advantage of the one country, two systems status it now finds itself in.Glyn Roberts Chief executive, Retail NIThere will be no celebrating todayGlyn Roberts Chief executive, Retail NIThen: During that election campaign Retail NI campaigned for Remain vote. We had expressed concern with the likely impact Brexit would have - the disruption for the economy and all that goes with it.Now: We do have real concerns about the west-east and east-west trade for businesses, but we have to accept that Brexit is now happening and we have to make the best out of what is going to be a dficult and challenging situation. Were halfway through the Brexit process and we still need to get a trade deal.By no means are we out yet and our worry is getting the trade deal done in this short space of time is going to be a huge challenge.There will certainly be no celebrating today. Our priority has to be that all of the relationships and networks we have built up over  years will remain. It is the worlds biggest single market. While we are facing the Brexit situation with great trepidation we need a big bold radical plan for the economy and how we move forward.Richard Kennedy, Chief executive, DevenishWe need to ensure frictionless tradeRichard Kennedy, Chief executive, DevenishThen: When the news came through in June  that the people of the United Kingdom had voted to leave the European Union, my initial reaction was one of extreme disappointment. As an international company with ambitious growth plans outside of our home markets, I knew it would have a huge impact on us, and the local economy.Now: At Devenish we have been preparing for Brexit since the result was announced. There have been many twists and turns since then and we have been monitoring the situation closely, refining those plans along the way.Leaving the EU without a deal would have been disastrous for the agri-food industry. The Withdrawal Agreement is far from perfect, but it ends much of the uncertainty that has been a constant throughout this process.We need to ensure that an agreement is reached between the UK and EU that maintains a frictionless trading relationship between the two.Phillip Logan, Director, Algram Modern Living, ex-DUP MLANow there is a bit more certaintyPhillip Logan, Director, Algram Modern Living, ex-DUP MLAThen: I campaigned on a personal level to leave from the sovereignty point of view, and identity point of view. From my point of view it was mainly down to identity and having control of our own laws.Now: Its certainly brought a little bit of uncertainty and that has had an effect on business. But Westminster messed about on the issue for too long, failing to implement what people wanted. But since Westminster moved on with Brexit, confidence has come back, and there is a bit more certainty. We havent seen any increase in cost prices relating to Brexit. But there is still a long road ahead. However, I have no regrets. We will be more successful.Liam Duffy, CEO and owner, Classic Mineral WaterBrexit could easily have been avoidedLiam Duffy, CEO and owner, Classic Mineral WaterThen: My views are that Brexit was a very poor decision back in  which was based on misinformation on the leave side and the remain side not doing enough work to ensure it didnt happen. It very easily could have been avoided.Now: In  my views have not changed. Its still a poor decision. I havent spoken to one businessperson in the past three and a half years who is happy with Brexit, nor have I heard anybody set out the advantages in a plausible and rational manner. Were lucky to be able to source our raw materials here in Northern Ireland so we will not be relying on importing these from across the border."},{"url":null,"title":"irish border communities struggling to get mortgages due to brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At pm on Friday, bonds stretching back to  when the UK joined the European Economic Community will be broken, but the Prime Minister insisted that Brexit will mark \"not an end, but a beginning\". Very little will change at the moment of Brexit as a result of the deal which Mr Johnson agreed with Brussels and the  remaining member states. But the UK faces further uncertainty as both sides seek to strike a trade deal by the end of the year. In a symbolic move, Mr Johnson will chair a meeting of his Cabinet in Sunderland, the city which was the first to back Brexit when results were announced after the  referendum. And in what Number  billed as an \"address to the nation\" released an hour before the moment the UK leaves the EU, Mr Johnson will attempt to sound an optimistic note about the future and isions which have been caused in the bitter Brexit battles. He will say: \"Our job as the government - my job - is to bring this country together and take us forward.\" He will call Brexit \"the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act\". \"It is a moment of real national renewal and change. \"This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your le chances - your familys le chances - should depend on which part of the country you grow up in.\" As pm arrives, Big Ben will remain silent, despite a high-profile campaign fuelled by Mr Johnson for repair works to be halted to allow Parliaments bell to ring. But on Parliament Square, Brexiteers will gather for a party led by Nigel Farage, while Union flags are already flying around Westminster. In official events, Downing Street will be illuminated with a light show and a new p coin will enter circulation. In Brussels, the UK flag will be removed from the EU institutions, with one Union flag expected to be consigned to a museum."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think the Brexit debate has been very polarising, not just in Northern Ireland but right across the United Kingdom so the first thing to do is not to be triumphalist and acknowledge that people dont want this to happen, I do acknowledge that. But secondly then to work with colleagues in the newly-formed Executive to find a common ground between us all.\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteers sing god save the queen in belfast as clock strikes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The real winner tonight is democracy. And I am someone who believes we should be pro-Europe, but not the European Union.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Brexit was “a deep break for us all” and warned the “negotiations will certainly not be easy”.French President Emmanuel Macron said Brexit was an “alarm signal” for the EU and hit out at the “lies, exaggerations, simplications” that led to the Leave vote."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say february","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Football clubs, Brooke Park Bowling Club, users of the fitness suite, youth groups and dog walkers from the local community aired their views at a public meeting yesterday evening. It was chaired by People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin and council officials were on hand to provide a response to any queries. Independent councillors Gary Donnelly and Sean Carr were in attendance as well as SDLP Councillor Mary Durkan. Mr Harkin began by saying that Derry City  Strabane District Council must be more “transparent” about its plans for the site as there had been rumours circulating that the old leisure centre may be demolished to make way for parking facilities. googletag.cmd.push Dalton Kehoe, of Rosemount Resource Centre, said speculation had emerged that a new centre may be built at the old Foyleville Day centre. Issues verbalised at the meeting centred around the top section of Brooke Park which includes the leisure centre, G and grass pitches and parking facilities. They included the need for additional changing facilities for the outdoor pitches, proper maintenance of those pitches, the need for new equipment in the gym and the possibility of reduced prices for community groups. The prospect of increased opening hours to bring the park in line with tier one facilities such as Templemore Sports Complex and Foyle Arena was also to council officials. googletag.cmd.push Rosemount residents also highlighted concerns around excessive dog fouling in the park and the need to fine those responsible. A recent letter from football coach, Paul Roddy, fast-tracked the meeting which had originally been scheduled last October but was pushed back due to Westminster elections. Speaking at the meeting, Head of Community Development at Derry City  Strabane District Council Barry O’Hagan recognised that errors have been made in the past and that Brooke Park Leisure Centre should have been consolidated on one site. He added that to increase opening hours, to purchase extra equipment and offer concessions for youth groups would have to be paid for somehow, and would likely lead to increased rates. Mr O’Hagan went on to say that he and other council officials are happy to speak to community groups to take on board their grievances. He made it clear that no decision has been made to close the old leisure centre but recognised that upgrades are required. Mr Roddy said that groups which have used the facilities for years have been left out in the cold. He said the standard of facilities in Derry wouldn’t be accepted in Belfast or Magherafelt where his team recently played. “They would laugh at us, it’s ridiculous.” He believes that the grass pitch should be at intermediate standard with dug outs and a standing area for supporters and suggested that council needs to be more pro-active in terms of development. One service user said that people have left Brooke Park to train where because of the reduced weekend opening hours. He had asked about the possibility of Brooke Park opening earlier and was ignored, but he said when Templemore temporarily closed, its users were accommodated at Brooke Park and it opened earlier. Cllr Donnelly said that was unacceptable and suggested a proposal could be brought before the council to bring opening times at tier two facilities in line with tier one centres. It was agreed that a motion could be brought before the council about Brooke Park facilities but that the community must be fully consulted beforehand with another public meeting organised shortly to allow more people to have their say.

Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. Advantages are plentul, the reduced number of cars on the road is more environmentally friendly, it eases traffic congestion, travel costs are shared with other riders and it reduces stress by allowing you to read, listen to music, or relax when youre not driving. In addition, it saves time, prolongs the le of your vehicle and allows you to meet new people. googletag.cmd.push Millions of people car share across Europe but there is a reluctance to do so in Ireland and Britain. Well-travelled Spaniard, Venancio Calero moved to Derry two years ago from Alicante in Spain. He gained a PhD in Physics from a French university and now works as an engineer at Seagate Technology. His passion in le is travelling and he has moved around the world, residing in several European countries. In his view, there is a missed opportunity in Derry for carpooling, Venancio explained: “I am trying to promote a non-profit initiative for carpooling around the city. “Carpooling is something that I really miss from the countries I have lived before Spain, France, Germany and Poland, and I think in Derry it could be really convenient especially when connecting to the centre and west of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “However, the available pages here are really mis-used, and it would be greatDerry would focus on one and find the travel offers there and the people start to try carpooling. The name of the page is ‘Northwest Carpooling’. “Ive published on some pages and groups across Derry, it has got some audience, but still not enough to really connect to people and get their trust.” He added: “I think that Derry misses big opportunities since the standard carpooling sites are not being used and the travel offers on those sites are negligible. “For me, it is a pity since without car it is sometimes dficult to reach most of the cities or towns around Ireland on a short travel time. It sometimes becomes even double the time with the current offers. “A centralised carpooling site for Derry would make mobility much easier across Northern Ireland, but also will ease the travelling to the centre and the west south-west of Ireland. “I find that carpooling is also the best way to travel for those who like to socialise and have to make long trips with their own cars, in addition to save travel costs and makes mobility more efficient for the environment. “I’m hoping that people from Derry will give attention to carpooling, start to share their trips and it will start to become a popular way to travel around. I think Derry could also become a good hub for carpooling and reaching the city from dferent locations will be much easier than it is now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Evidence provided by a senior departmental official to Stormonts Economy Committee revealed the full extent of “dficulties” facing Ulster University in the development of its Belfast campus. Heather Cousins from the Department for the Economywas questioned about problems with the Belfast campus by MLAs on the committee. Ulster Universityhas requested a loan of poundm from DfE to complete its Belfast campus. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. googletag.cmd.push It emerged that overspend at the Belfast campus would now impact on commitments made in the New Decade New Approach document to expand UU’s Magee campus to , students. Latest figures available show the campus has , students, , of which are full-time. Speaking at the meeting, SDLP MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, said a business case for overall Magee expansion aimed at attracting , full-time students has been submitted but Ms Cousins informed her that it has expired and a new one is required. The meeting was told that UU was asked for it last year but its council was not in a position to provide it and Ms Cousins said the major capital project in Belfast will have to be delivered before anything  happens. googletag.cmd.push In response, Mrs McLaughlin commented: “You’re saying quite categorically that a new business case is required for the expansion of Magee because the business case is not fit for purpose nor do you have confidence in their ability to deliver it at this time.” When told that summary was correct in the “short-term”, Mrs McLaughlin added: “What is short-term to you  Because in Derry we’ve been waiting sixty years for this.” Ms Cousins again stated that an updated business case must be submitted as the current one “doesn’t stack up”. The “very out-of-date” case amounted to poundm in capital funding and poundm resource “that we just do not have and unless there’s new money it’s hard to see how that will happen because when there is new money it goes to health and schools.” There is no “skills balance” in the country, the SDLP representative argued, as it is all centred around the East. “We need all of NI to work, therefore our skills strategy and funding and resources need to be put to good use throughout NI.”  ‘Stringent conditions’ Mrs McLaughlin also asked about the review of further and higher education and MaSN places. At present, NI’s higher education system’s capacity is managed through the maximum student numbercontrol mechanism, under which the number of full-time undergraduate students at each institution is restricted. The DfE official indicated thatthere were full fees then a cap on student numbers would not be needed. Universities are given a total number of places and it is up to them how they are distributed. There are “stringent conditions” in place for Ulster University to pay back the public funds. The amount is so high because the university got into “dficulties” and assurances are needed that that it will manage its finances in future, Ms Cousins explained. As part of the business case put forward there was a report that showed the vulnerability of UU’s finances in general. Ulster University Belfast is now running to a revised schedule of  when it will be complete with a projected overspend of poundm – that will be drawn down over two years. UU must then repay that loan. It will be under “closer scrutiny” but because universities are autonomous bodies they are responsible for the management of their projects. “The measures that we’re putting in place now are because of the dficulties that they’ve got in to which also impacts on their financial stability and as a department we are more concerned with their financial stability than anything  which is why we are recommending the additional loan and conditions attached to it,” Ms Cousins said. She went on to say that UU has to demonstrate its financial sustainability and capability of its council and senior management. Oversight The meeting was told that the department was aware that things were going wrong in the past year. It was not receiving regular reports and the university council was not getting information. UU did not ask for assistance until recently when business cases were produced. DfE has confidence that an appropriate project director is in place but caveated that by saying it is “not without risk” because “fit out and IT” costs are still needed. Independent MLA Claire Sugden said there should have been better oversight to ensure the project didn’t run so badly over-budget. Revealing it is unprecedented, Ms Cousins said there have been major capital projects at both universities and the department has never taken these steps before. In answer to another question from Ms Sugden, she said UU provided medical school business case but were required to provide an additional case on the medical workforce which is not yet completed. Until that’s done the department of health can’t make recommendations about the medical school. Sinn Feacutein MLA John O’Dowd also pointed out that it would now cost poundm rather than poundm which was the projected overall cost stated in committee members’ documents and questioned why the university had been given additional leeway.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Here is a player by player look at Magherafelts performance. Peter McKinney – It was a third clean sheet in five competitive games and this one was well earned. His save from Tiernan Kierans was one of the main reasons why they won. His handling was top notch, he saved two earlier efforts and kicked intelligently. Finn Diamond – Missed the win over Cavan but was a welcome ee to the St Marys defence. Was given the job of picking up Niall McKenna. While the Monaghan man notched three points from play, Diamond added to the Magherafelt attack with his runs forward. He played the pass for McElhennons point. googletag.cmd.push Matthew McNeill – Went up against Lochlainn Power. He did have help from Eoin McEvoy but he held the Macartans man scoreless. Got forward, used the ball well and was imposing in the air. Made a brilliant block to deny Power and really stepped up in extra-time. Shea McSorley – Picked up Michael Hamill initially who mainly played deep and it left McSorley to sweep back in front of the defenceanyone  attacked. Was perfectly positioned to pick up a breaking ball from the last Monaghan high ball pumped in, hoping to engineer a late goal. Eoin McEvoy – Played as the sweeper against the wind in the first-half to close down the space but still got forward when he could. Was positioned more in the wing back area in the second-half and had a huge role in Magherafelts comeback including an inspirational effort when they trailed by three points. googletag.cmd.push Conleth Mallon – Gave away height to Conor McCooey before he eventually dropped off to play deeper. He had to find the balance between getting forward. Playing at wing-forward in the second-half. Saw plenty of possession, rarely wasted it and kicked an important score. Johnny McErlain – Started at centre-back and with McEvoy behind, it allowed him to hold the middle and push forward to midfield. In extra-time, he played as the sweeper and his presence never gave Monaghan a snf of the goal they needed to save the game. His long ball led to Kevin McNicholls point. POLL Who was tour man of the match  Click here... Aidan McCluskey – Began at wing-back on Darragh Treanor but morphed into a more central role as the game wore on. Was off-target from frees but always had the courage to have a go. Never shirked the responsibility. His point levelled matters mid-way through the second-half. Eunan Quinn – Started at midfield on Dylan Ballantine. Had a strong first-half where he won kick-outs and presented himself for the pass coming from defence. Struggled to impose himself in the second-half and was replaced with  minutes remaining. Dan Higgins – He took his goal with the composure of a veteran. Only for a last ditch tackle, he couldve added a second in the next play. Put himself about well at midfield and was able to get forward to add a point. He won McErlains high ball in lead-up to McNicholls point and set-up Callum Ormsby for the clinching second goal. Eunan McElhennon – Sliced over a classy score, into the breeze, to get the Convent off the mark. He was a brilliant link man in the counter-attacking side of their game. He was always looking to get involved in the play and made an inch-perfect interception when the result hung in the balance. Ryan McKenna – It was his kick that handed Magherafelt the passport to Clones and he once again delivered when the pressure was on. Missed a few chances and did a lot on unselfish running to get on the ball. With his teams hopes resting on this shoulders, he slotted over the th minute equaliser to force extra-time. Sean Duffin – Played much of the game at wing-forward where he won a dficult possession that led to Conleth Mallons first-half point. Found it more dficult to get on the ball in the second-half and was replaced by Callum Ormsby. Conhuir Johnston – He may only be in Year  but he certainly didnt show it. Played up front with Kevin McNicholl and led the line. St Marys began extra-time on the front foot and his confident strike put them ahead on their way to victory. Kevin McNicholl – Lost the first two balls to Ronan Boyle but continued to show and proved to be an effective ball winner. Always took the right option, was comfortable on the ball and was rewarded with a point during Magherafelts purple match in the final quarter. SUBS Callum Ormsby – Came in for Sean Duffin and emphatically hammered home the second Magherafelt goal. Ryan McEldowney – Brought on for Eunan Quinn and was unlucky to miss a chance to level the game before McKennas last gasp heroics in normal time. Caolan Crozier – Replaced Kevin McNicholl at half-time in extra-time and gave fresh legs. Joe McVey – Played the last  minutes after coming in for Ronan McKenna. Conor Fowley – A stoppage time replacement for Shea McSorley. MATCH REPORT - St Marys - St Macartans -. Click here...

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

The scheme aims to improve levels of educational achievement for children and young people by providing additional support to help them reach their full potential. One hundred and fty pupils from Strabane Controlled Primary School, St. Catherine’s Primary School in Strabane, and St. Mary’s Primary School in Clougher, have already had an educational talk from a range of departments across City of Derry Airport and got to experience a “pleasure flight” over the city and the surrounding areas. The pupils took flight from City of Derry Airport on board Loganair’s Embraer  aircraft as part of their aviation experience. David Gamble, teacher at Strabane Controlled Primary School, expressed his delight on the project. He said: “Many thanks to City of Derry Airport and Loganairfor the flight experience they offered to our pupils from the Strabane Extended Schools Cluster group. “Our pupils thoroughly enjoyed their day at the airport, consolidating their knowledge on the topic of flight as well as learning about the day to day running of an airport. Thank you very much.”Extended schools activities are designed to support learning, raise school standards and promote healthy lestyles, enabling schools to work closely with members of the wider community and connect local people with local services.Hannah Campbell, a member of Loganair’s marketing team, said: “Everyone at Loganair and City of Derry Airport had a really fun day welcoming pupils onboard our Embraer  aircraft. There are numerous career opportunities in aviation, from working in passenger service to aircraft maintenance. Hopefully all of the pupils enjoyed taking part in the Extended School’s Cluster Project and perhaps some of them will now consider working in our industry.”Clive Coleman, contracts director at City of Derry Airport, said: “It’s fantastic to be able to support the Extended School’s Project from the Department of Education and I’m proud that the team at City of Derry Airport will be contributing towards these young people’s education – the young people who are ultimately the future of the North West region. And perhaps we’ve inspired some aviation professionals of the future.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fr OKane has been involved with St Eithnes since the idea of a second school for the parish was first suggested. He was there through the years of planning and, no doubt, fought for finances from the Western Education and Library Board and Department of Education. Fr OKane was has been here for St Eithnes as a constant support to the entire school community as well as being a wonderful ambassador for the school.

From its small beginnings with a staggered intake of children in  the school has now grown to over  pupils,  teachers and  classroom assistants. Everyone has a part to play. We have parents and parents of former pupils who volunteer with us too and grandparents that are making all the costumes for the school show and have made a beautul quilt for the th anniversary. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: The original staff of St Eithnes Primary School with principal, Gerry Cosgrove, seated centre.  This small army of helpers continue to provide a vital support to staff and our children, directly through support in class and indirectly by providing many resources for our school.

Michael Farrell, , of Hawthorn Park in Greysteel, was detected driving at the speed October  last. It was also stated that Farrell was driving without insurance. The court heard that a police patrol on the dual carriageway detected Farrell driving between the Longfield roundabout and the Broadbridge roundabout. Police stopped the vehicle and Farrell said I put my hands up. The court also heard that Farrell had ben detected driving at mph,  miles over the limit, on June . Defence solicitor Paddy MacDermott said that police had told the defendant thatit were not for the fact the road was quiet he would have been charged with dangerous driving. googletag.cmd.push He said Farrells child was sick and he was going to get Calpol. Describing it as a very stupid piece of driving, Mr MacDermott said that Farrells licence was essential to him. Deputy District Judge Alan White said: mph is just beyond the pale. I am always willing to give a chance to people who break the law but anyone who drives at this outrageous speed has to be disqualied. Farrell was disqualied from driving for six months and fined pound. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

Flooding peoplersquos lives with the hope found in the good news of the gospel, bringing out the God-colours into the world.That is to be your primary aim as a Bishop.The sermon was followed by the Rite of Ordination and for the ordination prayer and laying on of hands, Archbishop Clarke was joined by other bishops, the Methodist President and former Presidents.The new bishop was then vested in his robes and given a Bible before being presented to the congregation who greeted him with loud, sustained applause. The Dean of Belfast, the Very Rev Stephen Forde, then installed Bishop McClay in his cathedral stall.At the reception which followed in Ulster Universityrsquos Birley Building, Bishop McClay expressed his thanks to all those who had taken part in the service, his parents and family and the many people who had travelled a distance to be there.Bishop McClay said he looked forward to building on the work of two predecessors, Bishop Harold Miller and Bishop Gordon McMullan, who he had been ldquoprivileged to serve under.He added: ldquoIrsquom very grateful for all that they have put in place by way of a heritage to build upon.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

Instead this part of the kingdom is left behind under the control of the EU Customs Union and Single Market.

This is a very bad outcome from an economic perspective, because our biggest external trade by far is with Great Britain, and that now faces barriers. It is all the more bad from a unionist outlook because it ides the UK. There is a long story as to how we ended up in this position, much longer than the space of this column allows. The key event, the referendum, happened fast, from David Cameron’s  election win to the In-Out vote a year later. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Even within unionism there was a range of responses from hardcore Brexit to emphatic Remain to undecided to apathy. For months this paper gave space to both sides of the debate, before concluding that the arguments were strong for and against but the case for leaving clinched it.Thereafter we advocated NI to be treated the same as GB, ideally the Norway option which would have meant no regulatory border east, west, north or south.But events swept aside Northern Ireland. There will now be a harder Brexit and dferent treatment for NI.We can only now make the most of it. Push to minimise the Irish Sea barrier. Work relentlessly and diplomatically within Stormont to make the case for the fullto UK control, which is theoretically still possible.It is possible that London will flourish and the EU including Dublin will do too, in which case we make as much as we can of access both ways.Jim Allister: Our pleasure at our departure from the EU is blighted by the betrayal of Northern IrelandClare Bailey: Brexit signals only discord and ision Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profound        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Opinion\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

We have been clear we will not be doing so.”And in what Number  billed as an “address to the nation”, to be released an hour before the moment the UK leaves the EU, the Prime Minister will promise to heal the bitter isions opened up by Brexit.He will call Brexit “the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act”.“It is a moment of real national renewal and change.”As Brexiteers prepare to celebrate the UK’s withdrawal at the stroke of pm on Friday, in European capitals there was sadness at the breaking of a bond dating back  years.Mr Johnson will spend the evening in Number  hosting a celebratory reception for senior ministers, officials, and supporters of the  referendum campaign to leave the EU.Brexiteers will gather for a party in Parliament Square led by Nigel Farage, while Union flags are already flying around Westminster.In official events, Downing Street will be illuminated with a light show while a new commemorative p coin is entering circulation.In Brussels, the UK flag will be removed from the EU institutions, with one Union flag expected to be consigned to a museum.In Scotland, which voted to stay in the EU in the  referendum, candlelit vigils are planned.The Leave a Light On gatherings are taking place in Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow, and Stirling, among other locations, and participants intend to send a message to the EU to keep open a place for Scotland.In Northern Ireland, the campaign group Border Communities Against Brexit was staging a series of protests in Armagh, near to the border with the Republic of Ireland.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profound        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

I started the week as usual by walking Isaac to school, enjoying a father-son chat about the day ahead. has seen a rocky start with wildfires ravaging through Australia and tensions rising in the Middle East but this cannot set the tone for what is to come.As someone who has family in Australia, I am truly appalled to see the spread and devastation of the fires, but also the initial response from senior Australian politicians.Their denial of the link between the climate emergency which we face globally and the disaster which has swept across their nation is completely incomprehensible.Moving forward we must accept that we are in a state of emergency and must take drastic action to limit as much of the impact as practicably possible.We certainly have an interesting year,not decade ahead. The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/JM.jpg","title":"were in for another busy year ahead","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Are we in, or out  By the time you’re reading this, the UK is likely to be – from a technical perspective at least – about to leave the EU, and go it alone.In the four weeks or so since the last edition of the magazine, we’ve had a strong Tory majority pushing Brexit over the line and the restoration of devolution after three years without elected officials on the Hill. As we enter a new year and decade, there’s a sense, or a hope, of ato some form of normalised business environment. Brexit isn’t what business wanted, speaking generally, but it appears it’s what we’ve got. The minutiae of trading arrangements are still not worked out. Some sectors are more content than others, but we shouldn’t forget that Northern Ireland had a previous withdrawal deal on the table – largely backed by business – little over a year ago which could have set us apart as a unique trading environment, maintaining strong links with the Republic and the wider EU marketplace. But some of those in the political sphere seemingly put their own self interest and ideology above the future of the economy, and those who live in it. Tonight, some will take to the streets in and around the heart of the UK Government to show to the world their joy – perhaps misplaced – over the exit from the EU. For some, purely from a nationalistic perspective, its a chance to satisfy all the cliches that have plagued us over the last three years or so and for others, a chance to revel in an perceived brave new world – forged and fuelled by thoughts of a rose-tinted Britain gone by, Crystal Palace, heaving smoke stacks, heavy industry and fish and chips served up in newspaper on a pebble beach. For Northern Ireland business, and many people here, much of that platonic ideal is dficult to comprehend – especially among a younger generation. You just have to look at the breakdown in demographic of voters in the last General Election to see that. For some, tonight will be a time to mourn. Leaving the largest trading bloc in the world and, for better or worse, going it alone. Regardless, tomorrow and after the transition period in less than a years time, the hard work begins in trying to re-establish trading relationships with our EU partners which would see as little friction or duty as possible. Well know in the coming months whether the new market opportunities we have been promised will materialise, how long the processes will take, and what the immediate impact of exiting the EU will be for business across the UK and Ireland.We can now welcome the fact that we now have a working government at Stormont. Our MLAs are now back in their seats, committees up-and-running, and ministers staring at burgeoning in-trays. There seems to be some form of contentment and agreement among our parties on a range of important issues, including mental health. We are, however, already seeing the odd ergence, including whether we should continue the move to devolve and reduce corporation tax here – Finance Minister Conor Murphy pushing it into the long grass, while Economy Minister Diane Dodds has suggested that it remains on the policy books as an option.It’s just one of the myriad of areas of the economy and business which need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months – including a close look at the draft rates revaluation, which has certainly got the dander up among some of our best-known hospitality businesses.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
