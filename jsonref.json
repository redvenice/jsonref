Photograph: iStockThe “non performance” of the forestry service of the Department of Agriculture has done “real damage to confidence” in the sector, from growers to end users, the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture has been told. The committee heard that last year just 2,000 hectares of forest were planted, the lowest level since 1946, it was claimed. Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture Jackie Cahill said he was deeply concerned about the sector which had a planting target last year of 8,000 hectares, four times that which was achieved. He told Minister for State for Forestry Pippa Hackett, the service held “ a bias in favour of Coillte” the State-owned forest company. He said in one week recently Coillte had received licences at a rate of three to one versus the private sector. Mr Cahill said last year’s planting was the “worst since 1946” and added “future generations will ask what went wrong in 2020”. Teige Ryan, chairman of the Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland (Seefa) told the committee there was no certainty in the timeline for a licence application from the forest service . He said just 18 percent of applications were achieving a decision within the target timeframe. Applications he said seemed to go “into a black hole” and emails remained unanswered. He said farmers, growers and landowners were being forced out of the sector through frustration. Mr Ryan said the industry had told the forest service in 2021 that 7,000 licences would be required in 2022 for the sector to function and retain current employment levels. But he said in January the department outlined a plan to issue 5,250 licences for 2022, which he said the department had described as “highly ambitious”.He said “taxpayers have invested almost €3 billion in private forestry over the past 30 years” but “ the opportunity is being squandered because the department have proven inept and remain incapable of issuing the licences that are legally required”. “The non-performance of our department has resulted in real damaged confidence in the forest sector, from growers, to end users ,” he said. Matt Carthy TD said he had heard the administration of the sector described as “ inept and incompetent” and in heated exchanges he asked Ms Hackett “have you any proposals to address the dysfunction in the system”. Ms Hackett responded that many of the speakers in the debate had made remarks that personalised their criticism, and she asked them to refrain from doing so. Ms Hackett said “ we could be planting 9,000 hectares by the end of the year” although she said there were issues to be addressed. Ms Hackett said when future generations asked what happened in 2020, the answer was that forestry had been operating outside environmental regulations and this had to be addressed. “ That is why we are where we are,”she said. She said in total the forest service issued more than 4,000 licences last year, a 56 percent increase on 2020. “This included 2,877 felling licences, with a volume of nearly 8.5 million cubic metres. This is the highest volume issued in a single year.” She said 2021was also a much improved year for forest road licences, with some264 kilometres of roads approved.She said her department has recently recruited “a number of external ecologists who will, for the present, focus exclusively on afforestation. Once these ecologists are trained and bedded in, I am confident that the output of afforestation licences will increase significantly”.

Following the publication of the census results, it will decide on the number of seats in the next Dáil.PopulationHowever, the Government has determined that it can recommend a range of between 169 and 179, depending on population growth.The change will reverse the dramatic reduction in seats that was sanctioned by the Fine Gael and Labour coalition between 2011 and 2016. The number of seats was reduced from 166 to 158, but rose again to 160 for the 2020 election.The Government has said the substantial increase in seats – which could be as many as 19 – reflects the significant population growth in the State over the past decade.Last year, the population exceeded 5 million for the first time since 1851.

Photograph: Muhammad SajjadAP PhotoSehbaz Sharif was elected Pakistan’s new prime minister on Monday, marking the return to power and influence of the nation’s two main political dynasties after the dramatic weekend ousting of former cricketer Imran Khan.Sharif is the leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party and brother of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was removed from office by the supreme court in 2017 because of undeclared wealth.In a poetry-embroidered speech after his election, Sharif accused Khan’s government of being “corrupt, incompetent and laid-back”, but also struck some conciliatory notes. “If we want to move our country forward, it has to be through dialogue, not deadlock,” he said.The toppling of Khan on Sunday was a triumph for Pakistan’s leading political families, the Sharifs and Bhuttos, who were once bitter rivals but united in an alliance against the former sports superstar after he won election in 2018.“Welcome back to old Pakistan,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, leader of the opposition Pakistan People’s party and the son of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. “Democracy is the best revenge.”Pakistan has been ruled by the military for about half of its existence since the nation was founded in 1947 while the Bhuttos and Sharifs have led multiple civilian governments since the 1970s.The election of Sharif, a former chief minister of Pakistan’s most populous province of Punjab, ended a period of intense constitutional uncertainty in the nuclear-armed nation of 220 million people.After losing the support of a coalition ally and some of his own party’s MPs, Khan had sought to avoid a no-confidence motion by dissolving parliament.The supreme court ruled the move unconstitutional and ordered the parliament to debate the motion, paving the way for Khan to become the first Pakistan prime minister to be removed by a no-confidence vote.Underscoring Pakistan’s stark political isions, Sharif gave his victory speech to a nearly half-empty chamber. Khan’s 168 allies in the 342-seat National Assembly had walked out in protest, leaving the remaining 174 to vote Sharif into office.Disruptive forceAnalysts said Khan could now become a highly disruptive force against Sharif’s new government. Huma Baqai, an associate professor at the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi, said Khan’s “term as prime minister has ended, but his politics may become stronger”.Khan has sought to tap into reservoirs of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan and has insisted, without showing evidence, that his removal was orchestrated by the US. Washington has strongly denied seeking regime change.“The freedom struggle begins again today against a foreign conspiracy of regime change,” Khan said on Twitter on Sunday. His supporters demonstrated in large numbers against his ousting that evening.Khan “is heading to agitation right away”, said Ayaz Amir, a former politician with Sharif’s party who is now an independent commentator. “He will not allow this political system to settle down.”Blaming the US could play well for Khan, said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a former chief minister of Punjab.“In parts of Pakistan, anti-Americanism sells to the public, such as areas along the Afghan border,” Rizvi said, adding that it was possible Khan could emerge as a strong opposition leader.Pakistan’s next general election cycle is scheduled to begin with the dissolution of parliament in August 2023, but electoral authorities will have to decide whether or not to hold byelections soon after the resignation of scores of Khan-allied MPs.Economy under stressSharif will have to contend with intense stress on Pakistan’s economy.With global commodity prices soaring, Pakistanis have endured months of double-digit inflation. Food prices increased 13 per cent year on year in March, according to Pakistan’s Bureau of Statistics.Khan had tussled with the IMF over a $6 billion (€5.52 billion) loan programme, which had involved imposing unpopular measures such as increasing fuel tariffs.“Our economy faces extreme difficulties. It is a very grave situation but it must and it will change for the better,” Sharif told parliament.Nasir Ali Shah Bukhari, who heads brokerage KASB, said Sharif’s experience working in his family’s metals business before he went into politics would reassure the business community. “He himself is a businessman and has a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by businessmen,” Bukhari said.Sharif and his brother Nawaz have been dogged by corruption allegations, which they say are politically motivated. Nawaz was serving a seven-year jail sentence for corruption when he got special permission to visit the UK for medical treatment in 2019. He has remained in the UK since.Much may depend on whether the Sharifs and Bhuttos can maintain their alliance.Asfandyar Mir, an expert at the US Institute of Peace, said the two families found common cause as Pakistan’s powerful military sought to reduce their influence. “The military have deep disdain for both of these political parties,” Mir said. “So I suspect they’ll work together... they realise Khan is the common rival they have, and that he can make a comeback.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"An Irishman and a local joined forces to build a surfing community at the beach in Bureh\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"childbirths metoo moment","story":"On the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) antenatal course Claire Henderson attended, the parents-to-be played a game in which various childbirth scenarios were presented, centring around different medical interventions. What would they do if these were suggested during their labour? “The correct answer was to say, ‘I would like some more time,’” 38-year-old Henderson recalls. “When making birthing decisions, it was drummed into us that we were the ones in control.”Like all expectant mothers, Henderson hoped she would be. And with her NCT teacher strongly encouraging a ‘natural’ birth, she planned to have a water birth with no pain relief apart from gas and air: “I naively thought I’d breathe my baby out,” she says.Henderson says she received the impression caesarian sections were a “rare occurrence, due to bad luck” – although according to the NHS, around one in four babies is delivered this way.When she was induced last year at 42 weeks, her ideals went out of the window during the complicated labour. “The excruciating pain sent me wild”, she says, and she received an epidural.“At this point, I was distraught. I’d already failed. I’d had medical intervention. I was also terrified.”Her labour ended in a caesarean section that saved her baby’s life.“It took me months to come to terms with the birth I had,” she reflects. “I was told my baby would not have been able to come out naturally, no matter how much extra time I had. What the NCT course failed to prepare me for was that nature often has its own plan.”Henderson is among a number of women around the country sharing their childbirth horror stories following the release last month of the Ockenden Maternity Review on failings at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust. A culture of “reluctance” to perform caesarean sections was found to be rife at the trust.The report has prompted what some are calling a #MeToo moment for childbirth – and attention has turned to the perceived agenda of antenatal classes, with the NCT coming in for particular criticism over teachers’ apparent bias towards natural labour.“All they did was focus on the downsides of pain relief rather than the positives,” says Sarah Pitman, 39, who attended NCT classes in South London six years ago. “They left you feeling there was nothing to be done but try and get by on endorphins. In fact, I needed an epidural and an instrumental delivery but was left feeling I had massively failed.”Originally called the Natural Childbirth Association, the organisation was established in 1956 by Prunella Briance, who wanted to improve women’s access to information about childbirth and maternity outcomes, after her second pregnancy ended in stillbirth. Inspired by the writings of obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read, she placed an advert in The Daily  and The Times about the formation of an association to promote the Dick-Read system of natural childbirth.“In the 1950s, a lot of women went into pregnancy without really understanding their bodies or what was going to happen in the birth process,” says a former designer of NCT courses who worked for the charity for 30 years. “Briance wanted people to be given the opportunity to learn about the anatomy of birth but also to be able to ask questions and get honest answers.”In 1960, the organisation started to lobby the government to end the overuse of “interventionist techniques”. Research-based information became key to its policy at the start of the 1980s, by which time the number of branches had multiplied to more than 200.It continued to expand, until it became the default option for any expectant parent who could afford to spend a couple of hundred pounds on making a circle of local friends all having babies around the same time. Today it supports more than 80,000 parents a year through its services. Anecdotally, many women say the best thing about it is the friends they make there, and the NCT cites recent data showing 93 per cent of its courses have been rated good or excellent by parents.A spokesperson for the NCT told The : “We are not here to promote one way over another, but to ensure parents have access to evidence-based information. NCT practitioners are committed educators who care deeply about safe and equitable outcomes for women and babies. They qualify through rigorous training, validated by the University of Worcester, and engage in assessments and ongoing professional development to support their practice.”Michelle Eshkeri, a former NCT teacher in North London, says the two-year diploma in antenatal education that’s required means the training is “very thorough compared to some competitors” and encourages choice for women. “I taught everything from how to facilitate a natural birth, all the way through to the pros of a caesarian section and how it affects your recovery.”The former NCT course designer agrees: “There are some rogue teachers, and some with some very definite ideas.”However, she says problems sometimes stem from clients who have have already made up their minds about the labour they want so are little inclined to take note of the discussions around medicalised births.“The NCT has always been the scapegoat when things go wrong.”Still, a few days before the Ockenden report was published, the NCT deleted a number of its web pages outlining its childbirth guidance. One included the claim that natural births would leave mothers “more satisfied”. The charity says it is going through a gradual process of updating the site.“Our website hosts a range of evidence-based information for new and expectant parents, and it’s really important that this is up to date with reference to the latest evidence and terminology,” says the spokesperson. “We have an ongoing process of reviewing all our digital content, including articles about different types of birth and interventions. All the information we share needs to reflect our position today and the wider discourse around birth.”Its course content was “extensively reviewed and refreshed in 2019, building on feedback and research with expectant and new parents”.The problem, argues Eshkeri, is that not all ways of giving birth are always possible in overstretched hospitals.Experts agree this must change. “It’s much better to inidualise care,” says a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. “You sit down with the inidual, you talk through the pros and cons of the different types of birth, taking into account how she is, any medical problems and how the baby is, and then come to the right decision with that woman and support her in her decision.”The mothers who feel betrayed by a culture they feel stigmatises medicalised births will no doubt welcome these words.

Previous studies have linked it to an increased risk of pathogens and nutritional deficiencies, for example.Prof Andrew Knight, the study’s co-author from the University of Winchester, said: “Statistical analysis of the survey results suggested that, overall, dogs on conventional diets were less healthy than dogs on raw meat or vegan diets.”He added that more specific research is needed to determine whether a raw meat or a vegan diet is associated with better dog health.The researchers found that half of dogs on a conventional diet had a health condition of some description, dropping to 43 per cent for raw meat and dropping even further to 36 per cent for a vegan diet.This, combined with previous findings, led the researchers to suggest that a nutritionally sound vegan diet may, in fact, be the healthiest and least hazardous choice for dogs.Prof Knight said that the current study is by far the largest study published to date to explore the health outcomes of dogs fed vegan and meat-based diets.Writing in the study, Prof Knight and his colleagues say: “Vegan diets are among a range of alternative diets being formulated to address increasing concerns of consumers about traditional pet foods, such as their ecological ‘pawprint’, perceived lack of ‘naturalness’, health concerns or impacts on ‘food’ animals used to formulate such diets.“Critics have asserted, albeit without evidence, that biological and practical challenges in formulating nutritionally adequate canine vegan diets mean their use should not be recommended.”He added: “When considering health outcomes in conjunction with dietary hazards, the pooled evidence to date from our study, and others in this field, indicates that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs, among conventional, raw meat and vegan diets, are nutritionally sound vegan diets.“Regardless of ingredients used, diets should always be formulated to be nutritionally complete and balanced, without which adverse health effects may eventually be expected to occur.”More from NewsRishi Sunak’s popularity sinks again as he is now more disliked than Boris JohnsonMystery of why humans die around 80 may finally be solvedIs this childbirth’s #MeToo moment?Brooklyn subway shooting: Suspect arrested after taunting New York mayor about gun violence in online videosMarine Le Pen praises Brexit Britain, as she pledges to slash France’s EU contributionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"poland britain have never closer","story":"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is an unprovoked act of aggression against a sovereign, democratic state. It has brought pain and suffering to millions of innocent people. But the Kremlin’s miscalculated attack has unintentionally prompted the best possible response: relentless, heartening Ukrainian resistance, an unprecedented show of solidarity from around the world, the awakening of many countries to the dangers posed by Vladimir Putin’s regime, and the strengthening of alliances – including the age-old partnership between Poland and the United Kingdom.Our relationship dates back to the 11th century, but was consolidated in the heat of the Second World War. We first formalised our military alliance on the eve of the German invasion of Poland with the Agreement of Mutual Assistance, and it was reinforced during the war. Not only was Britain home to the Polish Armed Forces in the West, but also to the legitimate Polish state representation, which survived the war and the Soviet occupation.We fought side by side in the Battle of Britain, which turned the tide of the war. “Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few,” said Sir Winston Churchill, describing the defenders of British skies. And our cooperation was evident in many other areas, including intelligence sharing – a crucial factor in the success of Ukraine’s defence today. Polish cryptologist Marian Rejewski broke the Enigma code 90 years ago and, with his colleagues, passed their work to Alan Turing, laying the foundations for the mass code-breaking effort at Bletchley.This Polish-British cooperation has become even stronger in modern times. After Poland toppled the communist regime and regained its sovereignty, it soon joined Nato, signing bilateral defence deals with the UK – including the 2017 treaty, at the time only the second such treaty that Britain had with a European Union member state. Our two countries also served together in military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and as part of Nato’s Enhanced Forward Presence.The strength of our bilateral alliance has perhaps been demonstrated best over the past year, with the UK deploying military personnel to Poland – first to help stop the migration crisis orchestrated by Putin’s accomplice Alexander Lukashenko, and then to shore up Nato’s eastern flank against Russian aggression. And now, a new chapter in our relationship begins.Last week, as the situation in Ukraine became increasingly grave, Polish President Andrzej Duda met Boris Johnson in London. The two agreed to deepen cooperation between our armed forces, intelligence organisations and defence industries. We will increase our militaries’ exercises, step up work to counter cyber threats and disinformation, and deepen the defence strategy and security threat analysis cooperation. We will boost bilateral trade through high-level intergovernmental dialogue and a new expert task force. Crucially, we will work to facilitate the delivery of lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine. The UK will also increase financial aid to help support Ukrainian refugees in Poland.Poland and the UK, along with other European states, are demonstrating leadership in their support for Ukraine. Today, the Polish, Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian presidents travelled to Kyiv to show solidarity with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people. It followed a visit by the Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers last month, which conveyed the EU’s unequivocal support.Meanwhile, in Kyiv last Saturday, Mr Johnson said the Ukrainians had shown the courage of a lion and that Mr Zelensky was its roar. The Prime Minister went on to pledge extra military assistance to the besieged country.Ukraine is not alone. Russia’s brutal attack has demonstrated the worst and best of humanity. Most importantly, it has emphasised our solidarity with innocent people in times of suffering. For Poland and Britain, this solidarity means closer ties than ever. For Europe and Nato, it means unity. For Ukraine, it means hope amid an unimaginable tragedy. We will not cease until Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are restored.

The former MP, who last year lost her race to become a councillor to Labour, predicted the Conservatives will triumph at the local elections on May . Her public view echoes what many Tory supporters of Boris Johnson are saying privately - that they believe Partygate will blow over and they’ll get away with it at the ballot box. Tory letters of no confidence appeared to be receding for now with the -letter threshold to trigger a vote unlikely to event. This could change when the Ukraine war recedes, more fines are issued by police, or ethics chief Sue Gray issues a new report. That is despite Boris Johnson yesterday admitting he was the first ever Prime Minister to be fined for breaking the law - one he set and ordered Brits to follow. He, his we and Chancellor all paid £ fixed penalty notices issued by Scotland Yard for celebrating the PM’s birthday while indoor gatherings were banned.  It also comes after another Tory Boris Johnson ally, Michael Fabricant, defended the PM by saying there were no pole dancers and claiming NHS staff drank at work too. The PM has denied deliberately lying, despite repeatedly telling MPs no rules were broken and then seeking to blame staff. Yet Ms Currie, who had an affair with future PM John Major and was later an MP during the s sleaze that brought down his government, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I don’t care, I really don’t care. “What matters for me and what matters for millions of people in this country is the results we get from our politicians. The results we get from Boris are pretty good.” She added: “Last week we had a by-election here in the High Peak and we took a seat from Labour which means we’ve taken control of the borough from Labour. “Everybody had an opportunity to express their viewpoint. And what happened was we won the seat, we actually won it, that’s what’s happening.”  GMB host Richard Madeley said it was extraordinary she didn’t care whether “a serving prime minister knowingly misled Parliament - what does that say about where we are today and our political climate ” Mirror Associate Editor Kevin Maguire added: “It’s debased, collapsed standards where truth, honesty and principle don’t matter any more and I think that’s a terrible moment in British politics.” It came as Boris Johnson defender Grant Shapps claimed the PM was “completely mortied” by his own illegal birthday party and insisted the PM didnapost knowingly lie. The Cabinet minister protested: “He’s human and humans err and sometimes they make mistakes and that’s what happened here. The Transport Secretary said what happened was “deeply upsetting”, pointing out he couldn’t see his father in hospital for months during lockdown.  He was confronted by Sky News host Kay Burley who repeatedly questioned whether Boris Johnson was an “honourable man”. And he was grilled by a BBC presented who quoted the testimony of bereaved families who think the PM must resign - leaving him briefly speechless. Mr Shapps told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “He was frankly embarrassed, he appreciates what happened was wrong and indefensible… he’s mortied.” He added: “He said to me it was stupid, it was indefensible, he’s mortied he didn’t see it at the time.” Yet he claimed the Tory leader should not resign because he’s got “the big calls right”. “By the same logic, anybody who broke a lockdown law in their job would go,” he added - despite a court last year hearing a police officer who walked in Snowdonia in lockdown would lose his job.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, said the policeaposs decision marked the first time in the history of our country that a prime minister has been found to be in breach of the law. Speaking in Preston, he accused Mr Johnson of repeatedly lying about what happened behind the famous black door of No . Sir Keir also argued that the Tory leader and Mr Sunak had dishonoured the sacrices made by Britons who did follow the rules during the pandemic. The British public made the most unimaginable, heart-wrenching sacrices, and many were overcome by guilt, he said. But the guilty men are the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. Britain deserves better, they have to go. Labour has joined the chorus of demands for the Commons to be recalled from its two-week Easter break and allow Mr Johnson to tender his resignation in person to MPs.

Image: PAByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  Apr |commentsTory MPs have been urged to break their silence over Boris Johnsonaposs Covid fines as the Prime Ministeraposs future hangs in the balance. Former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called on her Westminster colleagues to step up and not stay silent over the fate of his leadership. The senior Conservative peer has accused the PM of making a mockery of the British peopleaposs sacrices during the pandemic. She was one of the first Tories to call for his resignation when the scandal first broke - and has stood by her position that he should quit. Baroness Davidson told the Mirror: If MP colleagues still believe that basic standards of decency and honesty matter in public le, they have to step up and not stay silent. The vast majority of Tory backbenchers have not publicly commented since the PM, we Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for breaking Covid laws.Some said privately they are sitting on their hands while they wait to see what comes next - with the PM facing the prospect of more fines. Detectives are investigating at least six Downing Street parties the PM attended, including one in his own flat. Jittery Tory MPs fear that a drip, drip of criminal sanctions for Mr Johnson in the run up the local elections could damage the partyaposs chances. They are also concerned that the Sue Gray report, the summary of which was damning for the PM, could stir up public anger further.Yet several Tories have claimed the Ukraine crisis means now is not the right time to change leader - even though other PMs have been replaced when Britain was actually at war.Three of those who had previously submitted letters of no confidence - Sir Roger Gale, Andrew Bridgen and Douglas Ross - used the excuse.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who had said it would be tough for Mr Johnson to remain in officehe broke the law, said: We are all angry, but the PM must stay. But on a campaign visit, Baroness Davidson said: “I believe that the office of the PM is traduced when you’ve got somebody that breaks the laws that they himself have brought in. I completely understand that there are really big geopolitics happening right now. There are big international issues. But I still believe that when it comes to supporting a country fighting for freedom and democracy, you have to uphold your own rules. You have to.” Tory Nigel Mills became the first MP to break ranks yesterday and suggest the PM should resign over his Partygate fine. The Amber Valley MP said people were “rightly angry” that the PM did not have the “decency or sense” to follow his own Covid rules while they did. Former minister Caroline Nokes emailed a constituent: “I have already been very clear that I believe the PM’s conduct fell far short of what my constituents have every right to expect. I do not need to write a letter of no confidence to the chair of the  Committee, mine was in a very long time ago.” Some Tory MPs suggested at the height of the Partygate scandal that the PM would have to gohe was found to have broken the law.

Michael Fabricant sparked fury with his defence of Boris Johnson after the Prime Minister, his we and Rishi Sunak were fined for partygate on Tuesday. The Prime Minister has paid a fine in relation to the gathering in the Cabinet Room on June , , to mark his th birthday - as it was a violation of coronavirus rules. The Lichfield MP said he thought that Mr Johnson would have to come to the Commons on Tuesday, when parliament s after the Easter holiday, to apologise. He went on to say: Having said that, I don’t think that at any time [Johnson] thought that he was breaking the law. I think that at the time he thought, just like many teachers and nurses who after a very, very long sht would tend to go back to the staff room and have a quiet drink - which is more or less what he has done. Mr Fabricant added: But I don’t think he thought he was breaking the law. But of course that doesn’t make any sort of excuse.  The comments have prompted backlash from The Royal College of Nursing , which has called the remarks “factually incorrect”. Writing to Mr Johnson, Pat Cullen, general secretary of the RCN, said: We remain at the forefront of pandemic response. Despite political narrative, as health and care professionals we know the Covid- context is nowhere near over. “While you position yourself with some authority as to the behaviour and actions of nurses during the pandemic, Iaposd like to inform you of the following facts. Throughout the pandemic - and still certainly, now - most days, nurses and nursing support workers, when finally finishing a number of unpaid hours well past sht end, will get home, clean their unorms, shower and collapse into bed. Throughout the early pandemic, this was often alone, for the protection of others - kept away from family, friends and support networks. These shts - in communities, in hospitals, anywhere people are - are long, unrelenting, understaffed and intense.At the end of one of the many hours, days and years we have worked, since recognition of the pandemic, I can assure you that none of us have sought to hang out and aposhave a quiet one in the staff room.apos There isnapost a site in England that would allow alcohol on the premises for any professional to consume during working hours. As frontline professionals, still dealing with the implications of the pandemic - understaffed, underpaid, overworked, exhausted, burnt out and still holding it together while doing the best we can for our patients. It is utterly demoralising - and factually incorrect - to hear you suggest that our diligent, safety critical profession can reasonably be compared to any elected official breaking the law, at any time.Speaking of the June  incident, the Prime Minister said it initially did not occur to him that the gathering in the Cabinet Room to mark his th birthday was a violation of coronavirus rules.He described it as an occasion for people I work with to pass on their good wishes - and said he didnapost realise at the time that the party broke the rules.However, he said that after being issued with a fine as part of a politan Police investigation into alleged parties at the heart of the Government during the pandemic he now humbly accepts he did breach Covid- laws.Scotland Yard, according to a statement published by No , said Mr Johnson had been fined because on June   at the Cabinet Room.... between  and  he had been part of a gathering of two or more people indoors, which was banned at the time. The Prime Minister, speaking to broadcasters at Chequers, said he fully respects the outcome of the police investigation and that he accepted in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better from him. However he dodged questions over whether he would resign, instead insisting he wanted to get on with the job. This was echoed by Mr Sunak. Labour has joined the chorus of demands for the Commons to be recalled from its two-week Easter break and allow Mr Johnson to tender his resignation in person to MPs.It comes as a snap YouGov poll of , adults taken on Tuesday found that % of people think the Prime Minister should go, with the same proportion thinking the same about the Chancellor.

But while Mr Johnson apologised, he made it clear he wonapost resign for attending the lockdown gathering in Downing Street for his th birthday on  June .His future now rests in the hands of Tory MPs, who have to decide whether to oust him or gamble that the furious public will forgive him over Partygate.The only way to topple a Prime Minister who wonapost resign is through a no-confidence vote. A ballot is triggered when  Conservative MPs - % of the parliamentary party - write to Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady.  At the height of the scandal in January and February, mutinous Conservative MPs were openly talking about sending no-confidence letters - with a handful breaking cover.But early indications suggest Conservative MPs are now rallying around the Prime Minister amid concerns about a leadership vacuum during the conflict in Ukraine.Some MPs are also privately concerned about the lack of an obvious successor. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs leadership hopes were already in tatters after a damaging row over his weaposs tax affairs - and he also received a Partygate fine for the same gathering.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, another frontrunner, initially won plaudits for her handling of the Ukraine crisis but also caused alarm by her disastrous suggestion the Brits should go to fight in Ukraine.No will be watching carefully to judge the mood of Tory MPs in the coming days. Tory Nigel Mills became the first to call for the PM to quit today, saying his position had become untenable. But some of the PMaposs most vocal critics have fallen in line.Here are some of the Tories who have retracted their criticism so far... Douglas RossThe Scottish Tory leader demanded Boris Johnson resign in January after the PM admitted to briefly attending a BYOB bash in the Downing Street garden in May . Mr Ross, who quit as a junior minister after Dominic Cummings apos lockdown jaunt to Barnard Castle, was one of the first senior Tories to call on the PM to quit.But he withdrew his letter to the  Committee last month and said the focus should be on the war in Ukraine.  Mr Ross doubled down on his position despite the news that Mr Johnson had been fined by police.Anything that would destabilise the UK Government at this time would be a bonus to Vladimir Putin, he told BBC Radio Scotland.Sir Roger GaleSir Roger Gale publicly confirmed he had submitted a no-confidence letter in January, branding Mr Johnson a “dead man walking”. The veteran backbencher, who is a long-time critic of the PM, told LBC: I think itaposs very serious indeed. And I frankly think that heaposs done a good job delivering certain things. “But I think weaposve now got to the stage where frankly we have to find another leader. But he has now said it is not the time to unseat the Prime Minister due to the war in Ukraine. David DavisThe former Brexit Secretary stood up in the Commons in January and quoted the words that helped to oust Neville Chamberlain: “You have sat there too long for all the good you have done. In the name of God, go.”Mr Davis never said he had submitted a letter but he was openly critical of the Prime Minister over Partygate.  But weeks later he U-turned and told the Evening Standard that now is not the time to talk about it after Russiaaposs invasion of Ukraine. The outspoken MP has kept his counsel since the PM was fined, suggesting he might have more to say. Andrew Bridgen A former Johnson ally, Mr Bridgen called on the PM to stand down or risk his legacy becoming mired in sleaze. The MP told thein January: If Boris truly loves our country, our democracy and our party he should go now with some semblance of grace. But he withdrew his letter in March, saying it would be an indulgence to hold a leadership contest during the Ukraine conflict. Mr Bridgen did not repeat his calls for the PM to go after the news of the fines broke, but he warned: This is not the end of this matter.

Registered blind, and totally deaf, Leslie Hodgson was ‘cocooned in a world of silence’ before the cochlear implant. He walked into the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, , years after his first ear operation in , to ask for the procedure after researching how it could change his le.Then he broke two world records. He became the oldest person in the world to receive a subtotal petrosectomy which cleared the lining of his ear to help him hear again.And he is also the oldest ever to receive the implant, which helped him regain his hearing for the first time in ten years.It was the perfect birthday gt as the retired architect was first seen by his surgeon on his rd birthday. Next, he is determined to try another pioneering procedure to tackle his blindness. Thanking hospital staff, Leslie, of Penrith, Cumbria, said: “Next year I want stem cell treatment for my eyes.” Noweed Ahmad, consultant surgeon at the South Tees Hospital Trust, described Leslie as a ‘remarkable man’. He said: “He has shown that you are never too old to have a cochlear implant. It can be le-changing.” After his hearing deteriorated, Leslie had ‘been trapped in a cocoon of silence’ made worse by blindness. “He has no family left and used to communicate with friends through the telephone but could not any longer,” added Mr Ahmad, an ear, nose and throat specialist.  “Deafness is the second most common disability in the UK. One in six of UK adults have a hearing loss and many suffer in silence. “Only five percent of people in the UK who could benefit from a cochlear implant are estimated to have received one.” The implant is a prosthetic device that uses electrical stimulation to provide the sense of sound, surgically implanted behind the ear. Leslie’s first ear operation in  was a mastoidectomy, done with a hammer and chisel. He is also registered blind and can only see things when they are very close up. Due to his age, the implant was done under local anaesthetic. It meant he was awake for both ear operations, with much less time to complete the procedures for Mr Ahmad. Leslie then ed to the hospital to get the implant ‘switched on’. Ruth Cole, audiologist at the trust said: “It sounds very strange at first as it is an electrical stimulus and this is new information for the brain to try to make sense of. Conventional hearing aids, which Leslie wore previously, only use an acoustic stimulus. “When switching on a cochlear implant, some people just hear beeping noises. Speech sounds like a robot or a cartoon character. “The brain has never heard the complex speech signals as electrical information before. Leslie can now hear some environmental noises and speech sounds. “It will take time for his hearing levels and the clarity to improve. We hope this will enable Leslie to communicate with those around him again and feel connected to his environment.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterCommentMORE ON PensionerDaily MirrorHospitalsWorld records,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The teenaposs mum, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she received the worst phone call of her le - telling her that her daughter had been assaulted and rushed to the scene.Police officers were also attacked on the night, the Liverpool Echo reports. Officers were called to reports of a fight at the event, on Acorn Way, Bootle, at around .pm on Monday, April . Security staff claimed a gang of teens and young people gathered outside the fair and challenged them. A witness claimed the violence was triggered by a row between girls on the bumper cars.  The mum told the Liverpool Echo: My daughter and her friend were thrown out of the fair, now I donapost know the reason behind why, and I do not condone it, she is now grounded for that reason. But what I don’t condone either, is grown men hitting these kids. My kid was knocked to the ground by a full force punch of a man who works at the fair. Her eye is terrible, she fell back and banged her head. You can see at the end of one of the videos that he punches her, and his colleagues are trying to drag him back to stop him from hitting the kids. He had already pushed my daughteraposs friend to the ground before he punched her. She added: I don’t know how she got out of there with the marks she did, because it was very violent everywhere. The kids went into a riot because two of them had just been attacked by adults, of course that is going to cause a conflict.The fair shouldn’t be open. There were about  kids there, and it has all escalated really quickly, there shouldn’t have been that many in there. One of them asked for a £ refund, just joking about it because they were asked to leave. But they think they can lay their hands on children, they can’t do that, it is absolutely disgusting. The kids were assaulted by five men, they were all protecting each other. Merseyside Police arrested two people following a disturbance at the fair. At around .pm they received a report that a female youth had been assaulted by a male youth at Bootle Fair. In a statement Merseyside Police said: It was reported that security staff at the fair ejected the male. Following this it was reported that a large group of youths gathered outside the fair to challenge security staff.  Police attended to disperse the group and bricks and bottles were thrown at officers. Two police vehicles were damaged during the incident and an officer suffered minor injuries. A -year-old female from Runcorn was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer, criminal damage to a police vehicle and a public order offence. A -year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to a police vehicle. Both were taken into custody and have been questioned by police. Three youths reported that they had been assaulted by security staff during the incident and sustained minor injuries. Extensive enquiries into the incident are ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to contact police.  A Dispersal Zone was introduced in Bootle on Tuesday  April, following the disturbance lasting until pm on Thursday  April and officers will be in the area to deal with any incidents. The Dispersal Zone covers the area bounded by Marsh Lane, Hawthorne Road, Linacre Lane and Stanley Road. The order comes under Section  of the Anti-Social Behaviour  Policing Act , which gives police officers and police community support traffic officers powers to direct people they suspect are causing or likely to cause crime, nuisance or anti-social behaviour to members of the public to leave a designated area and notfor up to  hours. Under the legislation, officers have the power to seize any item, including vehicles, used in the commission of anti-social behaviour. Should a person who has previously been directed to leave the area , an offence would be committed, which they may ultimately be arrested for.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Merseyside Police\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His bosses suggested he called a taxi, which took him hospitalViraj Kakadia Image: MyLondon WSByJosiah MortimerGraeme Murray:,  Apr |commentsA worker who lost part of his fingers in a factory accident claims his bosses threw them away. Viraj Kakadiaaposs works for a firm, Taiko Foods, which provided sushi for major firms such as supermarket Waitrose.But he claims while working for Taiko in Ealing, London he had an accident and part of his fingers were severed, MyLondon reports.He was slicing peppers using a machine and wearing one of of the two steel gloves which his union claims was available to protect workers. Viraj tried to restart the machine and his fingers were trapped which led two of them being severed. His bosses suggested he called a taxi, which took him to hospital.  Medical teams at St Maryaposs in Paddington asked him where his fingers were, but according to his union, factory bosses told him they had disposed of them. Viraj is now permanently missing parts of two of his fingers. The company has not denied they disposed of his finger tips and a source close to the company confirmed this was the case. The GMB is now filing for compensation over “negligence” which could be worth upwards of £,successful. One union official called the case “harrowing” and has put in multiple grievances over the firm’s handling of the affair. GMB London organiser Hiten Vaidya said: “They should have called an ambulance.  It’s the employers responsibility, and it has been totally unacceptable.” Viraj, , originally from India, speaks little English and works six days a week at the factory. Mr Vaidya claims there was no sensor or safety guard on the vegetable cutting machine, and alleges the cutting machine broke down several times in the week before the accident but continued to remain in use. Figures close to the company insist all workers have adequate PPE and that the machine is in working order, and that a Bolt offered the quickest means possible to get to hospital. Viraj was not given sick pay for the two weeks he had to take off work, and was instead told to take it as holiday leave instead. The union says the GMB itself was forced to give Viraj emergency funds instead. Speaking through a translator, Viraj told MyLondon: “The employer is playing games with my le. If they sent the finger tips with ice with me to the hospital, I’d still have them intact today.  They didn’t call an ambulance, and they haven’t offered me any support.” A Taiko spokesperson said his annual leave entitlement would be reimbursed and he would be paid in full for his time off. Viraj is now back at work but says the finger which lost the most flesh is “still not bending properly” and remains “very painful.” He added: “There is no amount of money for that injury that would solve it. I lost my finger. It’s not a question of money. I expect the GMB union to help and ensure this negligence doesn’t happen to anybody  in future.” Viraj added: “The employer isn’t providing a safe working environment…The standards aren’t there. The training is not there. And it is not a trade union organised workplace. So we are standing up and protesting for our rights. They don’t treat us equally. They don’t value our work. And the jobs we do are very hard.” “Since my accident three months ago - the company hasn’t said anything about my injuries. Why is the company not helping and supporting me ” Viraj has not yet shared the news of his accident with his family as he fears they will not be able to cope with the shock. A spokesperson for Taiko told MyLondon: “As a national food manufacturing business, Taiko takes its health and safety obligations very seriously. The wellbeing of our colleagues is paramount. We provide each employee with thorough training and a full supply of PPE, and we ensure that all machinery is well-maintained and has the correct safety features in place. “This was an incident to which the on site team responded swtly and efficiently, ensuring our colleague reached hospital as quickly as possible. Our colleague will be paid in full for his leave of absence and we have reinstated any annual leave he took following this incident.” A Waitrose spokesperson said they were looking into the issue urgently: Worker welfare is incredibly important to us and weaposre really concerned to hear about this. We are investigating this as a matter of urgency with Taiko. There are more than  employees at the factory, with most earning the National Living Wage of around £ an hour. The temperature in the factory is below four degrees, according to the GMB. Around half of the workforce at the factory is estimated to be from ethnic minority backgrounds with English as a second language.

In previous years, it has been similar to Christmas with most members of the Firm heading to the service, which usually takes place in St Georgeaposs Chapel. But rather than all turning up en-masse, the royals follow a tradition that means that the most senior member of the family arrives last. In most cases, this is the Queen, and pictures from Easter services in years gone by have shown her relatives lining up outside the chapel waiting to greet her before they follow her lead and head inside. However, in , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge broke this royal rule by turning up after Her Majesty - but it seems it wasnapost due to their tardiness. Itaposs understood they got caught in traffic on the M on the way to Windsor after spending a few days with Kateaposs family along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Kate was pregnant with Prince Louis at the time.This meant they arrived after the Queen and after the service started and they had to quietly enter the chapel after the others. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. But itaposs likely the monarch was understanding - and she was later pictured smiling and laughing with them.However, it could be that William and Kate getting stuck in traffic travelling to Windsor could become a thing of the past - thataposs because reports have suggested they want to move to the area. Itaposs said theyaposve already started looking for places to live after checking out several royal residences and are also considering private property. And in addition, theyaposre also said to have visited schools in the surrounding area for their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.The family currently split their time between Kensington Palace in London and Amner Hall in Norfolk. But a move to Windsor would see them be closer to some relatives - not least the Queen, who now spends much of her time at Windsor Castle. Living on the doorstep of the Queen means William, Kate and the kids could pop in more often to see Her Majesty. It would reportedly mean a lot to the elderly monarch to have them nearby and from a strategic perspective, it would put William nearer to the action when discussing royal matters. William has a close relationship with his grandmother and would often have tea with her when he was a pupil at nearby Eton College. Meanwhile, a move to Windsor would also see them nearer Kateaposs parents Carole and Michael, who are based not far away in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

When she turned two, her hair really gained a le of its own. Her hair is nothing like mine or her dadaposs, Philip, . A friend sent me an article about a little girl with a similar condition, it was obvious that Rosie has uncombable hair syndrome too. We get stopped all the time when weaposre out and about. People are usually very fascinated, and we get a lot of comparisons. My favourite one so far was that she looked a bit like a miniature Einstein.Looking at Einsteinaposs hair, maybe he had it too! Despite the abundance of nice comments Rosie receives for her hair, there have been others who have not been so nice. Lisa said: There were a bunch of rude people once in a cafe we were in. We were minding our business when they started raising their voices and saying comments like aposshe looks like she got dragged through a hedge backwardsapos.And aposhave you never heard of a hairbrush apos I kept my cool and left but feelI was to be in similar situation again, that I would defend Rosie to show that her that she is beautul and that her hair is amazing. Rosieaposs uncombable hair is incredibly hard to tame, with Lisa trying hundreds of products to no avail. She said: I never brush Rosieaposs hair when it is dry, it must be wet or full of conditioner, and even then, I only go through it with a de-tangler brush. Itaposs very fluffy to touch, it feels like cotton wool, but breaks off very easily. Her hair is quite short compared to other children her age. It grows very slowly and sheaposs never had a haircut.When I brush her hair, it seems to be painful for her, so I usually keep styling to a minimum to avoid tears. Rosie is set to start at primary school in September, so Lisa has been preparing her with educational books about hair. She said: I bought Rosie a book called aposDonapost Touch My Hairapos. Itaposs aimed at young children with afros, but Rosie hates having her hair touched, so I want to make sure that she knows that she can say no. With her hair being so fragile, it feels good to prepare her for an environment where she might face some challenges.

The duke wants to bring his children to visit, but he and his family are “unable toto his home” because it is too dangerous, his legal representative has said. A spokesperson for Harry confirmed earlier in March that he would miss a memorial service for his late grandfather Prince Philip, but that he hoped to visit the Queen soon. However, later this week Harry and we Meghan Markle will travel to the Netherlands to attend the Invictus Games in The Hague. The couple’s decision to attend the event in The Hague has been blasted by palace insiders after Harry claimed it was “too dangerous” to travel to the UK.

Click here to sign up .And now Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, said the idea that Harry is unable to come to the UK due to safety concerns is “sheer unadulterated nonsense”, adding that the duke is “not an expert in security”. It is not known whether Harry will visit the UK and see his grandmother while he is on this side of the Atlantic for the Invictus Games. Askedhe would say the UK is a potentially unsafe place for Harry, Mr Davies told the PA news agency: “No I wouldn’t. He would get the same risk assessment as every other royal.  “Most of them now don’t get full-time protection or even half-time protection, so the truth is the UK is far safer than most other places. “And with great respect, Harry is not an expert in security.” Mr Davies said thatHarry had attended the memorial service for Philip last month he would have been protected due to being with family members. “But he chose not to. That’s his prerogative,” he said.It comes following reports Harry and Meghan will get armed protection from Dutch police during their visit to the Netherlands.The Express reports that the Games are regarded as a high-profile event warranting protection by the Dutch national police’s DKDB Royal and Diplomatic Security Service and another other state security service, according to sources and media reports in the Netherlands.Meanwhile, the newspaper also reports that during their time in the Netherlands, Harry and Meghan, who quit as working royals in , will not stay with the Dutch Royal Family on the trip or receive an audience with King Willem-Alexander or Queen Maxima while they are in The Hague. However, the King is expected to attend the closing ceremony and his aunt, Princess Margriet, is honorary chairwoman of the games and is due to be at the opening ceremony.

One of the oldest secular buildings in Birmingham, the boozer no doubt has many long lost secrets but the tunnel, which leads to the basement, has remained hidden until now.Some have asked whether it could be linked to the infamous Peaky Blinders street gang that operated in Birmingham from the s until the s. Workers made the baffling discovery while making way for the new West Midlandsline, reports Birmingham Live. Pub landlord Kieran McInerney said: The tunnel was uncovered during the digging of the road for theAlliance tram works. We opened it up and found it was a secret tunnel into the cellar, we had no idea it was there. The pub team shared a photo of the passageway, which sparked online speculation as to what the tunnel was used for. Some amateur historians suggested that it might have been used as a chute for coal. I’m thinking coal shaft but weird position for it, one person wrote. Entrance to what would have been a coal cellar. The sacks of coal would have delivered from the drawn cart straight to the cellar, another added.  Other commenters were a little more imaginative with their guesses. One person guessed that Peaky Blinders used it to get to the Russian jewels while another said it goes to Mexico. A third person added smugglers of beer while others suggested it was used in relation to witches or bodies. One follower online speculated that the find was related to dead bodies that used to be kept in the cellar, according to a local ghost hunt tour. Another suggested the hole could have been used to get goods into the pub. I thought it has always been a pub so I thought it would be beer barrels to go into the cellar  they said. However others speculated that the hole was too narrow for hogshead-sized barrels. The most likely explanation for the tunnel is the theory that it was used as a coal chute.

Ali, , travelled to Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on October  last year and stabbed the veteran Conservative backbencher  times with a -inch carving kne in front of his aide, before being tackled to the floor by plain-clothes police officers. Julie Cushion, Sir David Amess’ aide who was present at the time of the killing, had her victim impact statement read to the court by Prosecutor Tom Little QC today, where she detailed her feelings of hopelessness and distress.  She said: “Since the th of October  I have had to drive by the church of Sir David’s death nearly every day as it’s close to where I live. It’s a constant reminder of what happened. I have a huge sense of guilt as I booked the venue. I can never get that scream out of my mind when Sir David was attacked. I remember that awful feeling of distress while we waited for help, feeling helpless and hopeless. The expression on the perpetrator’s face has stayed with me all the time. A look of smug, self satisfaction. I now work for a new MP, but I also have the fear that she could be attacked.”The family of Sir David said in a statement: There is no elation in our family today following this sentencing. Our amazing husband and father has been taken from us in an appalling and violent manner. Nothing will ever compensate for that. We will wake each day and immediately feel our loss. We will struggle through each day for the rest of our lives. Our last thought before sleep will be of David. We will forever shed tears for the man we have lost. We shall never get over this tragedy. It breaks our heart to know that our husband and father would have greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship and would have been anxious to help. How sickening to think what happened next. It is beyond evil.The judge said at the hearing: The defendant has no remorse or shame for what he has done - quite the reverse. This is a murder that struck at the heart of democracy. He described Sir Davidaposs death as a loss of national signicance. The whole-le sentence means Ali will never be eligible for parole, and will likely spend the rest of his days in prison. Current whole-lers include sexual predator Wayne Couzens, who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, and far-right extremist Thomas Mair, who murdered Labour MP Jo Cox in .

The stomach-turning video was captured at Birminghamaposs New Street Station, West Midlands.In the video, the vermin can be seen perched on the side of a plastic crisp shelf.The small grey pest hesitates for a moment before scurrying inside the shelf. But the rodent then disappears from view before re-emerging in another video clip. The furry creature again takes cover under the shelving units before darting across the shop floor towards the refrigerated section.One commuter who spotted the rodent claimed that it was a rat and that had been chewing though packets of crisps leaving crumbs over the floor. He explained that he visited the store regularly, but felt ill when he spotted the rodent. The customer reckoned the creatures had been there for some time and said he spotted the aposratsapos making holes in the crisp packets. He also claimed they left a trail of crumbs after chewing into the packets and munching the crisps. Speaking about his terrying experience, he said: I felt sick as I go into that Tesco every single day. I could see the rats in the crisps making holes in them. They must have been there a while as thereaposs always a trail by the crisps of unopened crisps bags which are never cleaned. I was waiting for the Tesco to open, the store is meant to open at seven but I was recording the rat at quarter past while the store was still closed.  A Tesco spokesperson said: We take food hygiene very seriously and have rigorous hygiene standards throughout our stores. Since being made aware of this video, we have closely monitored any potential pest activity and have not found any evidence of pests in our store.In July  the Mirror reported how footage captured a large rat scurrying around a Tesco supermarket.Danielle Westbrook, , dumped her basket and ran out of the shop after spotting the rodent at a Tesco store in Manchester.I let out an almighty scream, the gran-to-three told the Mirror.

It forecast “extremely busy roads”, made worse by rail closures and disruption. Network Rail said  engineering works will take place over Easter, adding: “There will be disruption on some routes, so passengers are urged to plan ahead.” Meanwhile the turmoil continues for air passengers. More than , flights are scheduled to depart from the UK over the weekend – but yesterday there were more reports of chaos at airports with long queues at check-in and security. One person at Manchester Airport said passengers queuing to check in for flights were “now starting outside”.  At Stansted Airport people reported “chaos again” at passport control. One tweeted: “Seven and a half billion people on the planet and they’re all in the passport queue at Stansted Airport.” Experts predict the travel disruption, caused in part by staff shortages, will stretch into the summer. Hold-ups at Dover have been worsened by PO Ferries’ ongoing suspension of cross-Channel services after last month’s sacking of  seafarers.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday: “This weekend will be extremely busy on our roads, potentially at our ports – particularly at Dover. So I do expect there to be disruption, with no thanks to PO there.” He added: “I am very concerned the operators – airlines, airports, ports – do ensure they get back to strength and quickly. “They lost a lot of people during the pandemic. We have been warning them for a long time that they would need to gear up again.” It came as another PO vessel was detained, casting doubt on whether the firm will be able to restart the Dover to Calais route before Easter.

The current record for the most consecutive marathons stands at  of the long-distance runs across  daysKate Jayden has completed her challenge of running  marathons in  days Image: Kate JaydenByAdam AspinallNews Reporter:,  Apr |comments A British athlete has completed  marathons in  days - breaking the world record for the most consecutive -mile runs.Kate Jayden, , challenged herself to complete the ,-mile challenge in just over three months. The current record for the most consecutive marathons stands at  of the long-distance runs across  days - but Kate beat this achievement earlier this month as she surpassed her th day. While securing the world record is an incredible achievement, this wasn’t the main goal for Kate, who originally set out to run the distance between the UK and Syria in a bid to raise awareness of the perilous journey undertaken by hundreds of refugees every day.The passage between the city of Aleppo in northern Syria and Dover, Kent - which is the most common route taken by migrants travelling to Britain - is around  miles. Kate utilised her skills as an endurance athlete to raise money for The Refugee Council by asking people to sponsor her to run this distance. But after realising how close the journey comes to theof  marathons, the compliance consultant from the Peak District decided she’d attempt to beat the world record at the same time. Kate said: “Every year I try to do something off-the-scale to raise money for charity. “I’d already planned to run the distance from Aleppo to Dover to get people talking about refugees and what they’re going through, then it dawned on me how close it was to doing  marathons. “It’s blown my mind that I’ve achieved this now. “I’m absolutely overwhelmed at having surpassed the world record.”Kate started her challenge on New Year’s Eve last year - getting up at .am every day to run a full marathon before commuting to Manchester where she works. She added: “For the first six weeks I was running  miles every day in the darkness.“I live in the Peak District so there’s no light pollution - it was literally pitch black - and the weather was really grim.”Unfortunately, Kate suffered a setback just over a month into the challenge when she injured her knee. Determined not to give up, she purchased a treadmill and started walking the distance, which took six hours every day. The added time meant she could no longer complete the marathons before leaving for work in the mornings. But Kate finished her th marathon on Sunday after completing the Brighton Marathon. On crossing the finish line, the -year-old, said: “I’m feeling geriatric mostly. “I was just overwhelmed. I feel very privileged that I was able to take that journey and so many people have been in touch to say they have been inspired by it too. “The mental grit and tenacity has got me through and to pick myself up and go again each day. “My motto throughout has been ‘don’t let anybody ever tell you that you can’t make a dference’.” Kate has now submitted an application for the most consecutive marathons run by one person to the Guinness World Records. The current record is held by US runner, Alyssa Clark, who completed  marathons in  consecutive days.

Mortgage adviser Saira Haider posts videos on TikTok offering financial advice to others, but has come under scrutiny for her own retail choices. People have been asking her why she shops at low-end chain stores and flies with budget airline easyJet when she drives such an expensive luxury car.Saira replied: That’s how you drive a Ferrari. Because you don’t spend your money stupidly on branded gear.She also said she pays half the price in a store like Aldi, compared to Waitrose, for a better selection of fruit and vegetables. And easyJet  she added. I’m not paying high prices to fly business class, to fly on the same plane, the same distance, in a seat that I can take my iPad and watch a programme on and pay the th of the price of business class. Saira concluded in her latest TikTok video: So it’s just sense… that’s how you make money. However that was not the end of the criticism. One person asked her why she does not drive a Fiesta instead of her Ferrari, applying the same principles as flying with easyJet.Saira responded by saying that she drives her car every day, whereas she does not take flights every day. She added: So I’m not going to pay for business class, I’d take easyJet - especiallyit’s short-haul. If it’s long haul I might think about something better. But when it comes to cars, I had a Fiesta actually - I think they’re amazing cars and my mum has one. ButI’m going to drive something every day then I want to drive something that’s just sensational.

In many ways, technology has connected us, made our lives more productive, and allowed people in every part of the world to organize for change and support communities in need. Yet this age has also ushered in signicant consequences. We don’t trust basic information, the safety and health of our kids are at risk, civil rights and human rights are being threatened, and marginalized communities are being targeted by a barrage of hate and vitriol.Technology itself has far outpaced our ability to reckon with its effects, and this is only going to magny as we enter a new generation of emerging technologies. Many of the underlying societal issues created by technology remain unaddressed.At Archewell Foundation, we are committed to convening, bridging, and accelerating leaders, ideas, and solutions for an online community rooted in equity, safety, participation, and belonging.

In fact, it was only when Taylor McManus, , contacted Jessica on the dating app that she finally figured out the truth about her unlucky string of failed matches - as it turned out she was only appearing as a potential match for gay men.Jessica, , was baffled by the error, and although she can see the funny side of the mix-up, she still has absolutely no idea how she managed to get her profile so wrong.

The recruiter, from Panama City Beach, Florida, US, said: I was newly single and I didnapost know how to use Hinge, I was so confused. I wasnapost getting any likes, it was making me question who I was as a woman. Iaposd just been liking guysapos profiles because they were all really cute. Then when Taylor told me Iaposd put my settings on to gay men, it made sense. Every profile was saying aposlooking for a cute country boyapos, and I was like aposwhy does it say that  Iaposm looking for a boy too!apos I donapost know how this happened but later that day I was able to view straight men so I donapost know how it happened. Itaposs so funny. For the day or so that she was set to see the profiles of gay men, Jessica noticed that their profiles tend to dfer from their straight counterparts - something she was a fan of. She explained: For the day or so that I was set to gay men, I realised I like their dating profiles. Theyaposre a lot more honest than straight men, and I love that. Heterosexual men will say aposIaposm looking for the love of my leapos, when theyaposre looking for Netflix and chill.Every gay profile seemed very honest and upfront about what they wanted. Jessica - who is now in a relationship - quickly became good friends with Taylor thanks to his kindness in reaching out to let her know what was happening, and the pair now rely on each other to solve their boy problems. She added: Maybe I was just supposed to meet Taylor this way, itaposs so odd. When he reached out to tell me, I thought it was very funny and it was just my luck. I sent it to all my girlfriends and I was just like aposwhy is my le this way apos Since this happened, weaposve become friends.

Grainne Fogarty Clinch, , and her new husband Paul tied the knot surrounded by her four children Declan, , Corey, , Hannah, six, and Kaiden, three.The new bride, from Blanchardstown in Dublin, had beaten breast cancer a few years before the ceremony, which was held last month. But a devastating MRI scan on New Yearaposs Day revealed a -and-a-half inch tumour in her chest.The couple shared just three days of marriage before Grainne passed away at a hospice on April , reports the Irish Mirror.Now her mother Lorraine Sherlock believes thatGrainne had received the MRI scan earlier, she may have been eligible for treatment to allow her more time with her four children and new husband.  She said: She got married on the Tuesday before she died in the hospice to Paul with her four children around her. She was a bride for three days before she died. She said to me before she passed that she didn’t want to leave her kids and I know that. She was a great mammy and they are sobbing constantly now, looking for their mammy. Grainne first complained of arm pain around eight months ago and was attending regular check-ups in Beaumont Hospital. The mum-of-four was also visually impaired but never let her eyesight defect deter her from living a full le.  Lorraine said: Grainne had breast cancer in  and had a lump removed from her right breast. She finished her treatment in May  and was going back to Beaumont for check-ups. Last year, she was going back and forwards to the hospital with a pain in her right arm but was given painkillers and told it was nerve damage as a side effect from the chemotherapy she had. The pain got so bad, she was crying constantly and she actually lost the power in her arm, but an MRI scan scheduled for October was cancelled as they said the number of her chemotherapy port wasn’t included in her referral letter. Eventually when she got to a stage where her arm had swollen and she couldn’t move with the pain, she was sent for a scan on January  and told on January  that there was a .cm inoperable tumour in her chest which was wrapped around the main nerve in her arm.There was nothing they could do. It was terminal. Grainne was sent to St Francis Hospice for her final weeks but ended up back in hospital when her pain became unbearable. She had to wait in ED on a chair in the corner, doubled up in pain for  hours before they sent her to oncology. The cancer had spread at that point to her lungs, Lorraine added. She has two teenagers with autism and she has a six-year-old and a three-year-old who I think should’ve had their mammy for longer. Maybe she was going to die of cancer anyway but that cancer was growing over the last year. If they carried out an MRI scan earlier when she first complained of a pain in her arm, they may have detected it. At that stage, maybe she might have had the option of treatment. She may have had the chance of a little bit more time with her family. But we’ll never know now for sure.The family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with funeral costs.In a statement, Beaumont Hospital said: “The hospital does not comment on inidual cases. “If the family would like to contact the hospital directly we can arrange for any issues of concern to be addressed.

It has been confirmed the couple will be protected by in-country officialsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will travel to the Netherlands this weekend Image: Getty ImagesByRussell MyersRoyal Editor:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have been given “VVIP status” by Dutch police and assured there is “no credible threat” to their safety, ahead of their visit to the Netherlands this weekend for the Invictus Games.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will travel with a private security team who have liaised with and confirmed that the couple will be protected by in-country officials. The couple’s trip comes just weeks after Harry stayed away from the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service in London last month. He is currently locked in a bitter legal battle with the British government after his taxpayer-funded Met Police armed guards were removed when he quit royal duties. In High Court papers the duke says he “does not feel safe” in Britain without armed security and says the decision is “unlawful” and “unfair”. The Mirror exclusively revealed last week that Meghan would make her first trip outside of the United States for two years to accompany Harry to Saturday’s opening ceremony, while they will be followed by a documentary crew from streaming giant Netflix along the way.Security sources have confirmed to The Mirror that the Duke and Duchess’s private security team have liaised with Dutch authorities and secured a “high level multi-agency protection programme” for the couple for the duration of their trip. It includes direct links to all law enforcement and emergency services, as well as “detailed exraction processes” in the event of a “personal or larger scale terror attack”. Harry and Meghan are also understood to have undergone a “hostile environment” training course run by their private security team aimed at protecting them.  Sources have confirmed reports that the Dutch national police’s DKDB Royal and Diplomatic Security Service will have overall responsibility for the Sussexes. Meghan will only stay for a “few days” while Harry will stay for the duration of the Games, but it is not known whether he will visit his family in the UK as part of his trip overseas. Dai Davies, a former head of royal protection at Scotland Yard, said the idea that Harry is unable to come to the UK due to safety concerns is “sheer unadulterated nonsense”. Harry, , and Meghan, , are understood to have armed protection when they are in the United States, but their private team are not permitted to carry arms in Britain or in Holland. One source close to the Sussex camp said: “Harry and Meghan have received absolute top assurances that there is no credible threat to their safety. “This is the view of the Dutch authorities and other agencies across the continent.  “In any case, as they are attending a high profile event in the Netherlands both the Duke and Duchess have been classed as VVIPs for the duration of their stay and overall responsibility for their safety at all times while in the Netherlands will be with the Dutch authorities.” The INTERPOL National Central Bureauin the Netherlands, described as “fundamental to maintaining national and regional security” is also based in The Hague where Harry and Meghan will visit at the weekend for launch of the Games, Harry’s global sporting phenomenon for injured service personnel. Dutch authorities have already told the couple their security team cannot be armedthey travel to Holland, but have given “high level assurances their protection is a priority”. The couple’s trip is the first time they have travelled to Europe together since quitting the royal family. Meghan has not travelled outside of the United States since the couple moved there in , first setting up temporary home at film producer Tyler Perry’s mansion in Calornia before buying their own £million mansion in Montecito. Askedhe would say the UK is a potentially unsafe place for Harry, Mr Davies added: “No I wouldn’t. He would get the same risk assessment as every other royal. “Most of them now don’t get full-time protection or even half-time protection, so the truth is the UK is far safer than most other places. “And with great respect, Harry is not an expert in security “This countryhas determined he is no longer at risk. “That may or may not be true, but people far better qualied than I am now can make that decision and they never make it lightly.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterCommentMORE ON Prince HarryInvictus GamesMeghan MarkleDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Georgina, nine, suffered a series of seizures in April  leaving her tetraplegic. The schoolgirl stayed in the children’s hospital in Patra, Greece, until her sudden death in January. Police later arrested her mother, Roula Pispirigou, , and charged her with killing her daughter. Cops were called when tests on her muscle tissue found she had been given a deadly dose of ketamine which was not performed by any doctors, according to Proto Thema. Nurses confirmed Pispirigou was alone with her daughter in the minutes leading up to her death.  Documents from Greece showed Georgina died  minutes after the dose was administered. In the wake of the arrest police began an investigation into the deaths of her other children- Malena, three, and six-month-old Iris. Malena died in July  from liver failure while Iris had a suspected heart problem. Forensic Pathologist and President of the Forensics Union in Greece, Grigoris Leon, said the exhumation of her other children also showed criminal acts were the cause of death. He said: “There is absolutely no doubt that it is a criminal act.“We had two initial reportsthat show the pathological cause of death. The first shows liver deficiency and the second heart malformation in the aorta as well as pulmonary embolism. “As you can understand, pathological causes do not go along with findings pointing towards criminal acts which is why revaluations are being made by my colleagues.” The mother appeared in court in Athens last week wearing a protective vest and flanked by armed security teams for her arraignment. She denied any wrongdoing.  Georgina’s grandmother, speaking outside her home, told local reporters she did not believe her daughter was capable of the crime. Magistrates later ordered a computer tablet buried with Georgina on the orders of her mother be exhumed as it could provide further evidence. A priest performed a prayer at her grave as diggers started working on the site. The children’s father, the defendant’s estranged husband, approved the exhumation be carried out. A trial date is yet to be agreed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder trial\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes as a total of  known women and girls, some as young as , were systematically raped by Russian troops who occupied the town. The United Nations has warned of widespread sexual violence in relation to the Russian invasion, with Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine ’s human rights commissioner, saying victims were falling pregnant.She told the BBC: Nine of them are pregnant. Russian soldiers told them they would rape them to the point where they wouldnapost want sexual contact with any man, to prevent them from having children. A -year-old woman called us to say her -year-old sister was raped in the street in front of her.  In another horrying report of sexual violence, a woman in Kyiv described being raped while her husband shot. Anna, , not her real name, was at home on March  when she says soldiers barged into her home before dragging her to a house nearby. She was made to take her clothes off, as a Russian soldier threatened to shoot her deadshe disobeyed. She then said the young, thin soldier attacked her. She said: While he was raping me, four more soldiers entered. I thought that I was done for. But they took him away. I never saw him again. After ing to her home a short walk away, she found her husband had been shot in the abdomen and left to die on the floor. Anna told the BBC : He had tried to run after me to save me, but he was hit by a round of bullets.The couple sought shelter in a neighbouraposs house, but Anna couldnapost take her husband to hospital because of the fighting. He then died of his injuries two days later, she said. Anna said she has since been in contact with the local hospital and is receiving psychological support. Her horric account comes amid other similar reports of women and even children being attacked.  Russian troops have also been accused of raping a pregnant -year-old girl and a -year-old grandmother in a Ukrainian village, a senior military official has said.Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration of Kryvyi Rih, said they are dealing with more and more horror stories. He spoke of the accusation of rape of a teenager and a gran in the Kherson region by Russian soldiers.Vilkul also claimed Russian troops shelled a boat evacuating  civilians from the Kherson region, killing four people, including two men, one woman and a -year-old, on Thursday.Seven were reportedly hospitalised with two still missing as claims that Vladimir Putinaposs army are committing war crimes continue.

The Russian leader wants tens of thousands of soldiers in the Donbass region to ensure victory after failing to take capital Kyiv and being driven out of the region. Experts believe Moscow’s forces are now regrouping but could soon outnumber their Ukrainian counterparts by as many as five to one - which would tip the scales of battle overwhelmingly in their favour, The Times reported.Images captured by orbiting satellites have shown the build-up of troops and equipment on the border - just as they did in the days leading up to the brutal invasion of Ukraine. Should Mariupol finally fall to the invaders, as many as six thousand troops could be freed up to join the effort to take the east in the Belgorod and Voronezh regions. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former British military chief, said : “[The Russians] will try to put more ground forces in the face of the Ukrainians at once to get the force ratios right, knowing the Ukrainians in the east are in very well-prepared positions.“The Ukrainians are going to need weapons of great range and lethality.” He added the Russians will try to encircle their enemies, forcing them to leave their well defended positions they have held since fighting began with pro-Russian separatists in Donbas since .It comes as Britain’s top soldier warned Ukraine and Russia are set for a “stalemate” as they prepare for a major battle in the Donbas.Chief of the General Staff General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith predicted the looming fight for the key eastern region borderingRussiais expected to be hampered by wet, boggy terrain.Kremlin forces are “at an operational pause right now as they regroup for a renewed offensive down in the south east”, the head of the Army told the Policy Exchange think tank. He added: “Whether that proves to be the decisive battle or not - at the moment we are measuring this campaign in days. “I think we ought to expect to measure it in monthsnot, in the scheme of things, years.  “Probably at this rate, the most likely, immediate and interim outcome is a military, tactical stalemate in the Donbas with a Russian regime able potentially to claim some measure of success, and that potentially acting as a possible launch point for a subsequent campaign.“I don’t think the international community and Europe is going to be able to live comfortably with a frozen conflict inUkraineat all.”He estimated between , and , Russian troops had been killed since war broke out on February , with between , and , injured. Meanwhile Putin said the invasion aimed to protect people in parts of eastern Ukraine and to ensure Russiaaposs own security.

Why steal everything  This is a school.aposThe soldiers had looted all the computers and electrical equipment before retreating from the northern Ukraine village - but there were some signs that someone felt ashamed.The camera crew found a message scrawled in chalk on a blackboard, pictured, that read: aposForgive us, we did not want this war.aposInside the school – a recently renovated two-storey building – thereports that the destruction is almost total. Ms Vowk surveyed the school with a journalist - stepping carefully through the debris as the building had not yet been checked for mines. “I don’t know how we’ll teach. The school bus is destroyed, so we can’t take the children to neighbouring villages,” she told the paper. It comes as a mum-of-one secured a visa for her best friend, from Ukraine, after spending  days on hunger strike. Rend Platings, of Cambridge, will host friend Kristina Korniiuk, , of Kyiv, who has now been granted a visa under the Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.Ms Platings said the visa application was made within minutes of the scheme opening last month. She started a hunger strike on April  after hearing nothing except an acknowledgement, stating that the “delay in issuing visas is adding to an already appalling humanitarian crisis”. The charity chief executive had planned to end her hunger strike on Tuesday after Ms Korniiuk’s visa was granted, and vowed to continue to campaign in other ways as more people await visas. But she later said she will continue her hunger strike for “at least a few more days to highlight the plight of people who are still waiting”. Ms Platings said it “feels amazing” that Ms Korniiuk can come to the UK.

I keep saying this is his last war and the end of days, but you have to come round to the view this isnapost end Putin - this is mid Putin.  Mr Boyes, who has covered the Kremlin for almost  years, added: There is time enough for him to do all sorts of damage. We are already beginning to see what that damage will be. It will be to the very substance of Russia - to itaposs civil society and it will be a proper purge. The purge has already begun in many ways - eight generals, some say nine, have lost their jobs.It comes as Putin has edged towards more extremist rhetoric in recent weeks, vowed that troops will use weapons of unprecedented characteristics after reports emerged of his soldiers deploying illegal chemical weapons in Ukraine. The warmongering president was surrounded by security officers as he touched down in the far eastern region of Amur yesterday morning to visit a space port in commemoration of the Sovietaposs first manned space mission.At a press conference shortly after, he vowed Russian troops have been using weapons of unprecedented characteristics in what seemed to be a veiled threat at NATO. In so-called warm words to soldiers on the ground, he said they are acting effectively in their military operation refocused on the pro-Russia Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The despotaposs chilling promise comes amid claims that Russian soldiers deployed illegal chemical weapons in the besieged city of Mariupol - where thousands of innocent civilians have been slaughtered.After leaving the plane Putin walked across the tarmac with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, with an agent clad in a jet black suit and tie walking just a few feet behind him. In his hand was a dark leather case - which reportedly contains Russiaaposs aposWhite Buttonapos which,pressed, could launch nuclear missiles and cause unimaginable destruction to targets as far away as ,km .

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

As the country emerged from its second lockdown, football was one of the few after-school activities available. As a result, many more girls came along to try the sport for the first time with the existing mixed teams at the club.Sensing the enthusiasm, Ally Robb, LVSC chairman and one of the club’s coaches, saw the potential to develop an all-girls team for the first time. With the support of fellow coach Bob Campbell, he ran an initial training session for P-P girls. This was quickly followed by another mini milestone: a first ever LVSC U girls’ game in a friendly against Penicuik in June .“After a great first game, coaches and parents alike were keen to ensure this new chapter in the club’s history was given every opportunity to succeed,” said Ally.In the nine months since the inaugural game, the club has extended training to include girls from P to P. Three new coaches subsequently joined the team and, with the support of parent helpers, they organise weekly training sessions and games.The club and team are now affiliated with the Scottish Women’s Football Association and this year have attended tournaments in Lauder, Galashiels and Coldstream, playing a mix of three, four and seven-a-side games..removeAnd it’s fair to say that the girls are loving the experience. Now aged , Sophie Thomas has played mixed football at the club since she was five but has really enjoyed playing just with girls – particularly when ing around in the mud as a goalkeeper.“We get to play with dferent age groups and we all play well together,” she said. “I think there is more passing in girls’ football.”“It’s a completely dferent atmosphere in the girls’ team, with the older players really helping the younger ones,” added Orla Thomson, aged , and another relative veteran of mixed games. “We all love playing in front of spectators as they shout their support.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve.

Though fairly typical of its time, it was a more intellectually inquisitive fanzine than most, and the sandy-haired, craggily handsome McKay seemed like a smart, cool guy, with the air of someone who knew where he was going.It turns out that he didn’t, not quite, and would spend a long stretch at the beginning of the s on the dole before finding a way into journalism through “cracks in the fabric” and going on to write fascinatingly about music and TV for numerous mainstream publications.All these years later, he’s resurrected the title Alternatives to Valium for his memoir of how a painfully shy boy from North Berwick – a place so unremarkable that even a visit by Brigitte Bardot passed unnoticed – found his voice thanks to punk rock.Anyone who grew up in a small Scottish town at a time when music was a matter of le and death will find much to identy with in the book’s first half. Living in a newly-built estate that already feels like a retirement community, the McKays are “a Grattan catalogue family in purple polyester kung fu pyjamas”, with Alastair thrilling to the sounds of Slade and Gary Glitter and pestering his mum to scour Haddington for a pair of glam rock shoes.Such books always run the risk of slipping into lists of kitsch s ephemera, and at times McKay, unable to resist namechecking Betterware and Sodastream, comes close. But it’s his punk-fuelled journey of self-discovery that’s the story here, as he forges an identity by spending his Saturdays touring the Edinburgh record shops and taping interviews with punk stars from Radio Forth with his dad’s Marconiphone tape recorder.He throws himself into producing fanzines and singing in bands, but he’s a frontman whose stage presence is so subdued he looks like he’s desperately trying not to be noticed. Writing a song so sad he decides no one should ever hear it marks the final setting-aside of his musical ambitions. “I have come to accept that my future does not lie in being an extrovert,” he says.But now that punk has helped him to find a voice, his next step is “learning to listen”. The second half of the book gathers together selections of interviews he’s done over the years, with artists as ied as Nirvana and Dolly Parton, in which he found out how to turn his weakness into a strength: “Interviews are a form in which shyness can be a secret weapon. If you are familiar with awkward silences, you can use them. If you worry about having permission to speak, the interview is your friend.”Which isn’t to say it’s always easy. Interviewing The Cure’s Robert Smith, McKay remembers being “deferential to the point of self-harm”. And his selections highlight the awkward, discomforting aspects of music journalism so well that they’ll induce horrible flashbacks in anyone who’s done it for a living. We see him mercilessly berated by Shane MacGowan, out of his element around Rod Stewart and pals as they get bevvied before a Scottish Cup final, or feeling physically threatened by a hostile Paul Weller at a Red Wedge press conference.ALASTAIR MABBOTTIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

If this project is pursued further, an opt-out should be promoted for Scotland. While she was Prime Minister for more than  years, she never came close to becoming an appealing personality in Scotland.Many of her policies were ill-received and heavily criticised in Scotland. One can think, for example, of Scotland going first with the poll tax in advance of the rest of the UK, the drastic effects of the cuts in state benefits on the more needy areas of the country, and the devastating consequences for many Scottish mining communities of the draconian programme of pit closures. Her unpopularity in Scotland was evidenced starkly by her hostile reception at Hampden Park when she attended the Scottish Cup Final in  between Celtic and Dundee United and thousands held up red cards directed at her.She never quite \"got\" Scotland and the idea of a special day in her name is unlikely to be greeted with acclamation here.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.LETS HAVE AN OPEN TRANS DEBATEAS a -year-old feminist, mother and grandmother I feel very strongly about the remarks made by Lorna Slater .

It has today been reported that the BBC deleted a reference by the head of the NFU as to Brexit being the main cause of the decline in British farming.It seems that the Brexit plan is rapidly unravelling and that is only being held together by those with a vested interest in promoting it. Even among the chief Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, it could be asked thathe thought Brexit was such a good idea, why then did he promptly transfer his assets abroad James Evans, Dumbarton.CUT THE RED TAPE FOR REFUGEESI ALWAYS wondered why families would risk their lives on inflatable boats over the Channel to reach Britain. Now with the fiasco of visas for desperate refugees from Ukraine, I understand the desperation. How does anyone ever get here through our red tape The Ukrainian refugees are living in desperate situations. Many would not have brought all the documentation our Government is demanding when they fled for their lives. Yet they are expected to upload documents, photos and the like and fill in page after page of information. These are not people coming for economic reasons. The majority will want tohomethe fighting ever ends.People are offering homes here but being told they need to upgrade them. It is officialdom gone mad. Let families in without quibbling over a newborn not having a passport, for heavens sake. Get them to safety asap.Davina Ellis, Milngavie.MANY BETTER ROUTES THAN NUCLEARI REFER to your article where it is stated that nuclear power “must” be part of UK’s energy system .Of course nuclear power is attractive as a quick-fix answer to the current panic about the rising demand for electricity and “global warming”and of course there will be interests in promoting this supposedly one-stop-sorts-it-all solution.Nuclear power remains as highly contaminatingand problematic in other respects as it was when it was decided not to proceed with the nuclear power programme.Meanwhile there is a lack of commitment to a whole range of other possible parts of the UK’s energy system – for example, tidal, geothermal, combined heat and power, heat exchange, passive solar like south-facing houses – but above all conservation.We are expected and encouraged to feel the need to use electricity for everything we do from washing the dishes to riding our bicycles or tightening a screw. Offices are lit  hours and a day we work in shirt-sleeves or “summer” dresses all winter.I have seen it estimated that by applying sensible conservation measures we could save at least a third of our usage.There is no “must” about nuclear power. It remains dangerous and environmentally damaging. There are many better routes to go.Clare Darlaston, Glasgow.Read more: Beware the cynical Levelling Up move to bypass our parliamentIt should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

Why is this Glasgow Airport is vital to the economic success of the city region and the constant haemorrhaging of international routes will quite clearly impact on the citys ability to attract foreign visitors. In particular, the complete absence of direct scheduled flights to the United States, for the first time in nearly  years, will likely have a chilling effect on US visitor numbers and the city businesses that depend on them.The current owner, AGS Airports, and the management team it has in place, appear to have little or no idea how to grow the airport or compete effectively with other airports in the central belt or where in the UK.Even more worrying is the complete lack of comment or question on the issue from the citys elected representatives and the council. It is surely imperative that they stop accepting excuses and start asking questions of AGS before the airports decline becomes irreversible.Iain Ratclfe, Glasgow.* I NOTE with interest John Taylors letter.In March , following a referral from the OFT, the Competition Commission forced the then owner of seven of Britains major airports, including Glasgow Airport, to sell off a number of its airports, because it believed that group ownership was not good for competition or investment. As a sop to those who attempted to oppose such proposals it was suggested that future owners should have experience in airport management and operations.The reality of the future sales was miles from the original sale proposals, and the buyers were financial investment organisations, who saw the airports as a \"a get richer quick\" opportunity it was once again an illustration of selling off more of the UKs assets. There were also other factors which would take too long to explain in the context of this response, but the overall situation that Glasgow and its airport now find themselves in is not at all surprising.There are solutions to this problem, but whether or not the present ownership is willing to participate is another question.Mike Dooley, Ayr.SEA EAGLES DO A GOOD JOBSNP MSP for the Outer Hebrides Angus MacNeil calls for the “control”, i.e. killing, of sea eagles because some may scavenge dead lambs . Perhaps a little ability to think why lambs regularly and naturally die at this time of year may help him persuade his voters that sea eagles perhaps do rather a good job in clearing up carcases from the landscape where their persistence might otherwise lead to contamination of, for example, water courses and reservoirs.The cold snowy weather we have experienced for the last month or more will take its toll on the lambs, of which more than . million are born annually in Scotland alone. That is nature, not agriculture. But, despite generous subsidies that articially sustain the sheep-rearing industry, the annual plea for compensation for every stillborn lamb seems irresistible.Bernard Zonfrillo, Glasgow.OLD FIRM GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOVEDIT is sad that on Easter Sunday the Old Firm match is being played. It should be a day of peace and for many in the city it will not be. Family gatherings for Easter lunch will take second place, as will children having a day with their parents, Easter egg hunts, laughter and joy. Would it have been so dficult to have moved it to the Monday or another day at the weekend Frances Burniston, Glasgow.* GRAEME McGarry acknowledges that detecting concealed bottles at the turnstiles is impossible and also avers that broken glass on the pitch and a head injury inflicted by a bottle and requiring stitches “didn’t quite seem to be ranked alongside the Old Firm shame games of the past” . Perhaps had a player sustained a fatal wound from the glass he might not be so keen to have the current alcohol ban lted.Duncan Macintyre, Greenock.READY FOR THE UNMASKINGI WAS in Glasgow city centre for some rest and recreation last weekend and I can report that the majority of people I saw on public transport, in pubs and in restaurants were embracing the forthcoming end of face masks on April  by enthusiastically practising for the much-anticipated event.Peter Wright, West Kilbride.TO A MOUSETHIS house-moving lark is proving rather more trying than expected. Somehow or other my mouse-mat has developed a slipperiness that is making the mouse unable to do its intended job which is to enable the little \"arrow wotsit\"to travel around the laptop screen. I have cleaned them both with the proper \"stuff\" but nothing seemed to work. A friend, who has the necessary know-how, made suggestions which did also did not work, so I sat and considered the problem while I tucked into The Herald. What was needed was something to make the mouse-mat rather less slippery and what better than something sticky Eureka! The very thing – micropore tape. I cut off a chunk, rolled it up and rubbed it over the mat. Problem solved.

Too often lately that has not been the case.#Loganair#s management set out some of the reasons for this, but also made clear their determination to get the service back on track and build public confidence. They also agreed to my request to re-establish regular meetings with key users of the service in Orkney. These have been useful in the past in allowing an exchange of information and for problems to be identied early.#I will be monitoring the situation closely over the coming months and would like to thank constituents who have been in touch to share their recent experiences of the service.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values. They are that memorable phrase we hear our elders say once they have explained its meaning to us, we are unlikely to forget it.Theyto us often and roll off the tongue.One of the most important collections of Gaelic proverbs was published in  by Alexander Nicolson .However, Nicolson was merely re-printing a collection made by Donald Macintosh, a Perthshire-born clergyman, first printed in Edinburgh in . Nicolson called the collection “a genuine product of the past” with Macintosh merely acting as collator and translator. of Islay, perhaps coined in the times when the MacLeans, MacDonalds, and later Campbells feuded over the island the second one is a rhyme about the MacAlpines, their former seat in Dunstaffnage, and their ancient claim to the throne of Scotland:When the natives forsake Islay, farewell the peace of Scotland!Children of the native kings, Who reigned down at Dunstaffnage, Who first the crown of Alba owned, And still have native claim to it..It also tells us that there are always grave, far-reaching political consequences whenever an indigenous population is forced to abandon its home.as a hereditary right can last for centuries. The strength of attachment to people and place shines through both.Blood is stronger than breeding., ‘blood is thicker than water’, and perhaps it should come as no surprise to us that a society which places strong emphasis on ancestry and blood ties should have so many proverbs reinforcing such beliefs..Sad is the inheritance of a bad disease.This proverb is the perfect reminder that not everything we inherit from our ancestors is good.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4576366.jpg--.jpg?1649424170000\n","title":"daria through to miss ni final","story":"A former pupil of Patricks College in Ballymena has made it through to the final of the Miss Northern Ireland competition.Daria Gapska, a -year-old childrens nursing student, recently ed to the college for a presentation to Year  on her chosen charity Braveheartsni.Daria was one of two finalists to be crowned at the first live Miss World Northern Ireland Heat of  in Nu Delhi, Belfast in front of an an astute judging  which included Managing Director of ACA models and Event organiser Victoria Withers.

Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold.

My niece was reading a book and one of the characters was called Chip,” she added.“A lot of people have said about Chip in Beauty And The Beast. In fact, the midwives all thought that was where it came from.”The couple originally had the name Chip picked out for Goldie, as they did not know what gender their baby was going to be.“We were convinced that Chip was going to be another girl, but as Chip was the only boys’ name we could agree on, it was already decided,” she said.“We weren’t fussed on the gender-reveal parties — we just wanted a healthy baby — so it was a lovely surprise when they were both born, as that is when the final decision was made on the names.”Emily said that the best advice she can give to soon-to-be parents is not to tell anyone any name ideas.“You’re always going to get someone who doesn’t like the name,” the Co Antrim woman said.“Just don’t worry about what other people think, because, no matter what, [not everyone] is going to like the name you choose — it’s inevitable — and at the end of the day it’s your child and no one ’s.”Emily has gained herself a following of more than , on Instagram after starting her blog five years ago when she went travelling to Morocco in a van she bought.“I don’t have the van any more, because I came home and settled down and had kids,” she said.The couple are currently renovating a -year-old semi-detached home, which they are documenting on the social media .Emily is also working on launching a children’s clothing brand called Mamie Mala, which she is hoping to launch this summer.“My middle name is Mary, after my granny, who used the nickname Mamie, and Mala is Goldie’s middle name,” she explained.“My mum was born in Malawi in Africa, so there is a strong meaning for the family, so Mala is after that.“I felt the names were unusual, and it works for the brand because it’s both something quite unusual and personal to us.”Read MoreMost popular baby names: Jack and Grace secure top spots as other parents seek inspiration from TV and celebritiesMost ReadSinn Fein stay quiet on John Finucane firm’s letters for wanted gang leader Daniel Kinahan‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

I would never have done this,” he said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I and Jim — and we all — owe loyalty to our party and it’s a pity that Jim, who has made a valuable contribution to unionism over the years, has taken this decision.“He owes it to the party, which has allowed him to gain positions he would not otherwise have gained. But rather than what he owes the party, what does he owe to the country ”Mr Poots, who served as agriculture, environment and rural affairs minister in the last mandate, said: “I have little doubt that Diane Forsythe will still win the seat.“But I think Harold McKee will inflict some serious damage on our vote. He is a decent man and a good candidate.”Now standing in South Belfast following the death of Christopher Stalford, Mr Poots also paid tribute to the service given by Mr Wells over nearly five decades.And as speculation mounted that Mr Wells will, as this newspaper also disclosed, join Jim Allister’s party, perhaps even sooner than expected, Mr Poots said he believed Mr Allister would be happy to see Mr Wells join the TUV ranks.“I am sad to see Jim go after  years of dedicated and faithful service to the party and I wish him and his family well for the future,” Mr Poots added.“He has been a close and valued colleague for many years. But the focus now must be on the election. It is crucial that the DUP wins as many seats as possible.”Mr Poots, who had himself been linked to the South Down seat before party officers finally selected mother-of-three Mrs Forsythe over Mr Wells, refused to criticise Mr Wells for backing Mr McKee, who is himself a former Ulster Unionist who only joined the TUV last November.Another outgoing DUP MLA, however, one of five who privately backed Mr Wells after he lost the party whip four years ago, said he was “shocked” that Mr Wells had backed another party.The DUP member, who does not want to be named, told Mr Wells he had gone too far by endorsing Mr McKee.Mr Wells contacted his party leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and DUP chief executive Timothy Johnston when he decided he would resign, rather than waiting to be expelled.He refused to talk about the detail of his conversations but said he was giving “extremely sympathetic consideration” to signing up to join Mr Allister’s party.Referring to his resignation, Mr Wells said: “I think the moment I said that I would not be backing the candidate that was imposed upon us, it was inevitable.“I took the decision to contact the party leader and the chief executive and let them know that, after  years, I have gone as a DUP member.”The DUP argued the election should be about more than “mere personalities”, after Mr Wells, who was the sole DUP representative in the constituency since , called on voters to give Mr McKee their first preference ahead of Mrs Forsythe.She has not replied to requests for comment.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceJim WellsMore On Democratic Unionist PartyAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From poster thieves and a determined postman in Upper Bann to a nuclear warning-style TV broadcastAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From a stressed Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and a missing lamp post, to ironic tweets PremiumDUP MP Jim Shannon withdraws ‘reference’ provided to Conservative MP convicted of child sex offenceFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidate PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionMost ReadSinn Fein stay quiet on John Finucane firm’s letters for wanted gang leader Daniel Kinahan‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

Just as he could never accept the fact that I was party leader as a WOMAN and he continuously agitated against me. Jim is still living in the s - sad but there it is. Mrs Foster said voters in South Down have a choice to select principled, able, active representation in Diane Forsythe. [Mr Wells] thought he could impose his will on the voters of South Down asthe seat was his and not theirs, she said.In response, Jim Wells said he would need “a stf drink” before reading Arlene’s opinion of him. “[Her] opinion of me is based on the fact that I was a strong supporter of the campaign to have her removed as party leader in May ,” he said. “I have not regretted that decision for a second.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Earlier on Tuesday Mr Wells, while speaking to the BBC’s Nolan radio programme, said: “I have now resigned from the party after  years. I have decided I cannot support the candidate that the party Executive have imposed upon the people of South Down.”Mr Wells admitted he walked before he was pushed after late on Monday night, he made the decision to contact senior members of the DUP to resign.I feel very strongly about this and I feel that Harold McKee is the best candidate to represent the unionist community of South Down,” he said.Read MoreFormer DUP leader Arlene Foster in tirade against Jim Wells after he endorses TUV candidateMalachi O#Doherty:OpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionPastor Rusty Thomas: US preacher who attended Lurgan rally claims ‘powers of darkness’ are pushing NI ProtocolThe move could pave the way for the former Health Minister to eventually join Jim Allister’s party.“Harold McKee is the standout candidate and I urge those who supported me in the past to give him their number one preference,” he said.“As I leave the Assembly it is my earnest desire that South Down should continue to have a unionist MLA whose politics are grounded in conviction and principle.“Among the candidates, Harold McKee is the standout candidate with these credentials.“He holds dear many of the core principles that I upheld in Stormont and is widely and properly respected as a politician of conviction rather than expediency.“Accordingly, I recommend him to those who faithfully supported me at the polls over the years and urge them to vote McKee .”A DUP spokesman said, however: “In our opinion only the main unionist party can win this seat and it is absolutely essential that we maximise the number of seats we have in the next Assembly.“Every seat counts. Make no mistake. If on the Saturday morning after the election, Sinn Fein is the largest party there will be no more talk of the health service or rising costs, the focus will be on getting a Border Poll.“Therefore nothing should be done which would split the unionist vote. Although we don’t believe unionism has anything to fear from a Border Poll, it would be destabilising and a distraction from the important business we need to get on with.”They added: “This election is much more important than mere personalities. The seat totals after the count will decide whether Northern Ireland goes in the right or wrong direction and our priorities for the next five years.“Diane Forsythe secured the DUP’s best ever result in South Down in . She is a young mother, rooted in the Mournes with a plan for South Down. Diane will focus on what matters to people.”Mr Wells, meanwhile, arranged a photo-call with Mr McKee and the TUV leader on Monday. Former Ulster Unionist Mr McKee said he was delighted and honoured to have Mr Wells’ support.“In the end he was abandoned by his own party but it is the mark of the man that he wishes the best for South Down going forward,” added Mr McKee who quit the UUP for the TUV last October over the more liberal approach of Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie and his party’s stance on abortion, same-sex marriage and support for a ban on gay conversion therapy.He added: “I am delighted to have Jim’s support and gratied that a broad swathe of unionism is uniting behind me as the standard bearer of principled unionism.” TUV leader Mr Allister also joined in welcoming Jim Wells’ support but there was no comment on the prospect of him joining Mr McKee in the TUV ranks.“At critical times in Stormont Jim Wells was often the only MLA prepared to join me in doing what was right,” Mr Allister said.“In December  we were the only MLAs to speak and vote against  EU regulations essential to bedding in the iniquitous Protocol.“Putting party advantage before principle would have been easy, but Jim did the right thing and likewise today in backing Harold he is putting principle before party.”Mr Allister insisted the Wells backing would bolster the chances of Mr McKee in the tightly-fought constituency where unionist isions could hand the last of the five seats to Alliance or the SDLP.“In strengthening Harold McKee’s hand he is laying the foundation for the continuance in Stormont of South Down representation based on conviction politics. We’ve seen enough of synthetic unionism it’s good to offer the real thing with Jim Wells’ backing,” Mr Allister added.Related topicsDemocratic Unionist PartyJim WellsTraditional Unionist VoiceSir Jeffrey DonaldsonEdwin PootsSinn FéinJim AllisterMore On Democratic Unionist PartyAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From poster thieves and a determined postman in Upper Bann to a nuclear warning-style TV broadcast PremiumFormer DUP colleagues blast Jim Wells’ decision to back TUV candidate in South DownAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From a stressed Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and a missing lamp post, to ironic tweets PremiumDUP MP Jim Shannon withdraws ‘reference’ provided to Conservative MP convicted of child sex offence PremiumMalachi O’DohertyOpinionStephen Nolan doesn’t always get it right buthe is silenced, then what  He isn’t the first to be scapegoated for damage done by isionMost ReadSinn Fein stay quiet on John Finucane firm’s letters for wanted gang leader Daniel Kinahan‘I wasn’t scared, just angry’...

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance.

The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive

as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES

figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and

He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility. In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

Image from RTEThere was a public meeting held in the Carrickdale Hotel in Co Louth in June  to allow concerned residents and others to share their worries. The best speaker that night was Jim Wells. He stood up and told all, “I am an MLA from south County Down. Even though my partywould not receive many votes around Greencastle, I still thought it was my duty to represent those constituents and express their concerns.” Mr Wells had driven from south Co Down up through Rostrevor, Warrenpoint, Newry, through south Armagh and across into Co Louth. Letter to the editorOne should bear in mind that Mr Wells and others in the DUP led a loyalist group into Co Louth in the s .Despite the somewhat long journey across mountains and around rivers into ‘a foreign jurisdiction’, Mr Wells still did it to represent people who would not vote for him. That says a lot about the man. Whatever  can be said about Jim Wells, he believes in public duty.That says a lot in my book. I have no love for the DUP, but I have a soft spot for Jim Wells for his action that night.Le dea-ghuí,Seanán Ó Coistín, Trier, Germany"},{"url":null,"title":"royal black leader hails opening of magnificent new headquarters in loughgall ","story":"Rumours of Article  move to suspend Northern Ireland Protocol are credible says Lord Empey   I would not have backed the Good Friday AgreementI had known of side deals such as the de facto amnesty for Provos onlyNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleRoyal Black leader hails opening of ‘magnicent’ new headquarters in LoughgallThe leader of the Royal Black Institution has hailed the opening of its new headquarters as an event that delivers an enduring legacy for future generations.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : pm  \"       \"  Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson, speaking at the official opening of the state-of-the-art centre in Loughgall, said: “There can be no doubt that this day marks an important point in our journey as an institution.“It is a time in our journey to give thanks for the past, to be assured of the present and to look forward in anticipation to the future.”Saturday’s grand opening ceremony took place after a colourful and dignied parade of more than , members of the institution, accompanied by  bands, through the picturesque Co Armagh village.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"wit wisdom this too shall pass ","story":"Class A drugs recovered by Newtownabbey PSNI   Former Larne solicitor Neal McAllister was a family man at heartNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsAdam Harbinson. WIT  WISDOM: This too shall passWith our recent fine weather I’ve been doing more than my usual five-to- miles a day walking, an activity that, with many of my countrymen, I developed during the lockdown, when there was little  to do, writes Adam Harbinson.By The NewsroomSunday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Last week was idyllic as I walked along the Donegal coast from Moville to Greencastle it was magical, and it struck me again, that while we all know the value of regular exercise, fresh air and social engagement, we might never really know just how beneficial such days are for our physical and mental health.But what perhaps, on the flipside, will our memories of - be in  years time  We’ll be asking ourselves, how on Earth did we remain sane  Brexit has wreaked havoc on our economy, piled on top of which was Covid-. I can still feel the cloud of gloom that settled on me when a radio announcer was suggesting that all over s would not be allowed outside the door of their homes for  weeks.Thankfully it didn’t quite come to that.Then came the murderous war in Ukraine, with pictures being flashed onto our screens of European families hiding in cellars in fear or their lives, not to mention the bloody carnage. But how does this bad news affect our mental health To further exacerbate my potential for anxiety I can tell you that five of my close friends and family members are suffering from le-threatening health problems one has even invited me to his rd birthday party, when he and I know full well that in reality it’s a ‘going away’ party. I’m in my mid-s and while I feel as mentally and physically fit as I was in my s, the thing I hate about my age is that so many of my contemporaries are dropping like flies.So, what can we do to protect ourselves  Firstly we must regulate our intake of deadly news regular exercise and getting out into the countryside is helpful too. Gratitude is of vital importance, so let’s get a pen and paper and make a list of the many aspects of our lives for which we can be truly grateful.But is that enough  You might say no, but since there might be little we can do to help our suffering brothers and sisters, we must recognise the need for serenity to accept the things we cannot change and thecourage to change the things we can.One thing’s for sure this too will pass.

He said: “It’s not every day you get asked to design a garden for a spectacular viaduct, it’s such a unique and dramatic setting, but, more importantly, it’s an incredible privilege to work on such a cherished local landmark for the people of Randalstown, what’s most exciting is a vibrant garden in this setting has the potential to transcend and give back more to the community than what the viaduct could in its original form.”Northern Ireland TV Presenter and keen gardener Gloria Hunnord shared the exciting news with the people of Randalstown for the BBC The One Show announcementThe group’s vision is to create a symbiotic relationship between a working garden and a world class amenity for locals and visitors, similar in concept to The High Line in New York. The garden will offer a mix of sustainable, pollinator-friendly planting, providing year-round interest, extended bee corridors, seeds and berries for birds, and shelter for hibernating species. The group say the garden will be the first of its type on the island of Ireland. They plan to establish an intergenerational team to maintain the site, broadening the local skills base and furthering their visibility in their current role of engaging and helping vulnerable people in their community.NI TV Presenter and keen gardener Gloria Hunnord shared the exciting news with the people of Randalstown for the BBC The One Show announcement.Helen Boyd, Chair of the group, said: “Everyone here in Randalstown is absolutely delighted about this project. “At the moment we don’t have any open green space in the Town, so this will be a vital and much used important place for the people of Randalstown. People’s well-being will benefit from the sights, scents and sounds which greet them in this suspended garden.” Community Garden for local people to relax, garden in and enjoy.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.northernirelandworld webimg TUFZMTMOTcwMDU.jpg width w, https:www.northernirelandworld webimg TUFZMTMOTcwMDU.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" Community Garden for local people to relax, garden in and enjoy.\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"The former railway viaduct, which spans the River Maine, in Randalstown, will become the next Royal Horticultural SocietyCommunity Garden for local people to relax, garden in and enjoy.The new Community Gardens will be central to the RHS celebrating and sharing the joy of gardening on RHS Garden Day on May .Read: Five Things to Do this Weekend in County Antrim"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649684275157.jpg--april_showers__keep_them_shorter_.jpg?164968427500","title":"april showers keep them shorter ","story":"Spring has finally sprung and with rising energy costs there is no better time to dust off old habits and create some new ones that are good for your pocket and the environment. Start by thinking how much water you are using each day. Whether you are washing your hands, cleaning endless amounts of dishes or getting through that mountain of washing, you start to realise just how important water is and the sheer amount we use. NI Water’s Environmental Outreach  Learning Officer, Anna Killen, explains how we can save water by looking at everyday habits, “It’s amazing to think that each day each person uses around  litres of water! However, saving water can be really easy, there are simple things we can all do that can make a huge dference. “Did you know that the average time people in Northern Ireland spend in the shower is  minutes, over % of people still overfill the kettle and less than frac of people have a waterbutt ”  “We want that to change and it’s easy, start by looking at small changes for example, your kettle, since working from home it has have been working overtime, but just fill with as much water as you need. Overfilling can use twice as much energy and water, each time you boil. “With rising energy costs, it might be time to think about reducing the time spent in the shower, hot water costs money! Why not try the  minute shower challenge, put on your favourite  minute song and seeyou can finish before the end.” To help you embed with these new habits and ‘Get Water Fit’, complete our online water audit at https:www.getwaterfit or take part in water saving challenges and receive your free water saving items including  minute shower timer, toothy timers and swell gel bags for the garden. Some water saving tips:  Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth - A running tap can use  litres ofwater per minute.  Use a bowl for washing vegetables - Then you can reuse this water for plants.  Make full use of your washing machine - Half load programmes on washing machines use more than half the water and energy of a full load, so wait until the machine is full before switching it on.  Fix leaking taps - A dripping tap can waste more than  litres of water per week.  Keep a jug of water in the fridge, instead of letting the tap run cold. NI Water are encouraging customers to sign up to its free text alert service which keeps them updated about anything that may impact on their water supply or any of our other services in the area.here https:www.niwater register-for-keeping-you-informed   addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffdfdccbbabddde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adeddffdcebcefdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
