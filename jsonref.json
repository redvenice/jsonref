In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, some states quarantined citizens others made the wearing of face masks mandatory, at the same time as shutting down “all places of amusement”. According to a law passed in San Francisco in October of that year, on the day that state-wide infections passed 50,000, anyone seen not wearing a gauze face covering was subject to fines that ranged from $5 to $100 and the possibility of 10 days’ imprisonment.The order appeared to work in “flattening the curve” of infection in San Francisco other American states took up the practice, which was also promoted across the Atlantic in Paris and in Manchester. Supply quickly became an issue, so in America churches and community groups organised mass mask-making sessions. When the order was lifted at noon on the last day of November, a blaring whistle sounded and, the San Francisco Chronicle noted, people threw off their masks leaving “the sidewalks and runnels strewn with the relics of a tortuous month”.The relaxation of the law proved premature. As the death toll rose again in a third wave of the disease – and despite the protests of the newly formed Anti-Mask League – mandatory mask-wearing was reintroduced for another six weeks at the beginning of the following year.

I thought this too - until I discovered how addictive and erotic they areIt requires a strange sort of skill to miss a phenomenon such as Twilight. The first instalment of Stephenie Meyer’s young adult series was published in 2005, when I was 15 and ripe for an obsession with vampires and sexual repression. But I had recently fallen in love with a boy who read Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett, and other funny books by men. I cringe now to think of it, but I followed his taste blindly, parroting his beliefs that Twilight was overrated, problematic rubbish, without reading it for myself. Of course, I came to learn how often all things beloved by teenage girls are dismissed, and I’ve never done it since – still, it took lockdown for me to finally read this contemporary classic. And while it is true Twilight has its issues, the books are addictive so much so that Meyer’s internet-breaking announcement of a new Twilight book, Midnight Sun, on Monday had me preordering faster than a girl melting under the intense gaze of a sparkly vampire.When the lockdown started, friends and fellow authors Daisy Johnson, Sarvat Hasin and I established a book club to get us through. I despise the phrase “guilty pleasure”, but we wanted a book that was inviting, entertaining, familiar. When I offhandedly mentioned I’d never read Twilight, it was met with shock and indignation. Our reading fate was decided. Seeking companionship for my government-mandated walks, I downloaded the first audiobook, narrated by Ilyana Kadushin, thinking I would consume all 12 hours in manageable chunks.Anyone who has read the four-book saga will know how foolish I was. Bella’s narrative is instantly immersive, capturing the all-consuming concerns of teenage life, albeit in the person of someone seemingly irresistible to all she meets, including the immortally sexy Edward. It is perfect wish-fulfilment, though the sorts of wishes no feminist should ever want granted. Bella trips through the novel as an object of desire, unintentionally becoming the flashpoint that reignites an ancient grudge. But Meyer is a brilliant storyteller, mastering pace, plot and sexual tension. It is erotic in a way Fifty Shades of Grey can only dream of.My 15-year-old self would have loved it, but my 30-year-old self loves it even more. If I’d have read Twilight half a lifetime ago, it would have only confirmed the worst of what I believed about relationships, gender and sexuality. Adams and Pratchett were kinder, more playful teachers. Now, I can plunge headlong into the Twilight books, admiring their strengths and laughing at their faults, alongside four (our number has grown to include my husband and a doctor of literature) of the most precious people in my life. Twilight was never part of my adolescence, but now it is an invaluable part of my lockdown story.Twilight has endured for half my life, so you don’t need me to tell you why there was hysteria when Meyer announced a new title, having previously claimed to have no intention of returning to the franchise. But it is no surprise to me the lure was too strong. Authors live with their characters long beyond the final pages. With legions of readers hungry for more, I am glad Meyer relented. We need joy and escape right now. With Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins also revisiting her own bestselling series with a prequel, The Ballad of Snakes and Songbirds, coming out this month, we have two YA authors indulging the teen fantasies of a generation of twentysomethings, and potentially igniting those of a whole new generation. The decisions to add prequels to these female-led narratives through male characters is especially interesting I do wonder if we will miss Bella and Katniss, while learning more about the men they love and hate.If you are on the fence, I can absolutely recommend you join the hype. Hopefully the emergence of YA culture as a world-dominating phenomena means people will stop dismissing books enjoyed by teenage girls out of hand. And if you, too, missed out on this epic of the YA canon, Midnight Sun is out in August – there’s still time to get some friends together for a readalong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e20b8402affbe49164d475eae0f8d374c1dd7f94/0_802_2446_1468/master/2446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b512b789b3b79f50da443e4fe78dbd6a","title":"cost of public transport should be raised as lockdown ends ifs","story":"Thinktank says preventing overcrowding on buses, tube and trains will aid public healthThe price of a bus, train or tube ticket during peak commuting hours could be raised to prevent crowding and the spread of coronavirus on public transport, according to a leading thinktank.Setting out a menu of options to end the government lockdown as ministers consider ways to reopen the British economy, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said discouraging public transport use during peak times could limit overcrowding and reduce the risks to public health.In a report detailing tools that could be used to reshape business and social activity across Britain as restrictions are gradually lifted, the thinktank said behavioural changes should be encouraged to tackle Covid-19.Among its recommendations the IFS said the usual logic of promoting public transport use – to cut congestion and pollution – could be reversed in order to limit the spread of the virus on packed commuter trains and buses, especially in London.“The government could alter the relative prices of different types of commutes to better reflect this new reality. Examples would be to increase the relative price of commuting at peak times on the London tube and bus network, or to suspend the London congestion charge for drivers,” it said in the report.However, raising the price of public transport would deliver a financial blow to people who cannot change their working hours or are unable to commute by car. The IFS said that while off-peak prices could be cut as an alternative, it would incentivise public transport at a time when commuting should be limited.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “We don’t see pricing approaches as the best way forward for public transport. Four in 10 key workers are paid less than £10 an hour. We cannot introduce blunt policies they can’t afford.”Business groups and trade unions were sent draft government guidelines on how to protect workers before Boris Johnson set out on Sunday how restrictions could be eased. But the TUC has warned that the plan would put people’s health at risk and could not be supported in its current form.Among further steps that could be taken to reopen the economy after more than a month of tough controls across Britain, the IFS suggested that tax breaks could be offered to firms that keep their staff working at home.“This is actually a convenient fact in the context of mitigating virus transmission. If Londoners do not work from home they are much more likely than others to commute by public transport, in which the risk of spreading the virus is relatively high,” the report said.A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he was clear that the easing of lockdown restrictions would pose challenges given the city’s high population density and busy public transport network.“Continued working at home for everyone where possible will be absolutely essential, alongside other major changes to people’s routines including staggered shift and opening hours, additional restrictions on the use of the public transport, and bold measures that ensure we get substantially more people walking and cycling,” Khan added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db31b78a19dcfb28b658abed9858558b11eef94/0_77_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c29f0bc3fb7d324a27b6f48b091df77","title":"small firms inundate uk banks with coronavirus loan requests","story":"Lender says banks may struggle with demand for official ‘bounce back’ schemeSmall businesses have rushed to apply for a new government-backed loan scheme, prompting one lender to warn that banks may struggle to cope with the demand.The bounce-back loan scheme (BBLS) was launched at 8.30am on Monday and had received 79,500 applications by the afternoon, already exceeding the 52,807 applications for the existing coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which started on 23 March.Anne Boden, the chief executive of the digital lender Starling bank, which has applied to be a BBLS lender, told MPs on the Treasury select committee that there would be some concerns about how quickly banks could ramp up their lending to cope with demand. The CBILS has been criticised for slow processing of applications.Under that scheme, lenders have to send data manually to the British Business Bank – the state-backed institution managing the scheme – to process the government-back loans. Boden said this method was “not sustainable”. The British Business Bank is now working on a new digital platform to speed up the process, but that will not be ready for another six to seven weeks.“My greater concern at the moment is that the processes within all the banks won’t take the strain of what’s happening to process all these loans and bounce back that quickly,” said Boden. “I think there’s going to be a scale problem here.”Starling only started CBILS lending on Monday, despite having applied weeks ago to be included.Accredited BBLS lenders told the committee there had been a deluge of claims on Monday morning.RBS’s commercial banking chief, Paul Thwaite, said staff had worked incredibly hard to get the scheme up and running on Monday morning and that the number of call centre staff had been doubled to more than 500 to deal with demand.But MPs asked whether bank systems would be able to cope with the surge in demand, including those linked to the British Business Bank.Barclays customers were reported to be struggling to access applications on the bank’s website. Hammerstein denied that the site was failing to cope, and said the bank’s technical team was increasing the number of applications the online site could handle at any one time.David Oldfield, the head of commercial banking at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs that his team also struggled to deal with the loan processing systems linked to the British Business Bank. Those systems were originally built for another government programme known as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee, which was not designed to handle such a surge in demand.The committee chair, the Conservative MP Mel Stride, warned that he would be drawing attention to banks that were “slow off the mark”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b5433a572cfbf99966e689d8cbe79d858a2c429/128_399_2985_1790/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a624a08646083e1ae7af32f273dd37b9","title":"food deliveries to vulnerable in uk need better coordination","story":"Consumer and disability rights groups say many struggling to access basics during pandemicConsumer and disability rights groups have called on the government urgently improve the coordination of food deliveries for vulnerable people, warning that thousands are not getting the help they need during the pandemic.The consumer group Which? said it had been contacted by more than 1,000 people who were either disabled, elderly or had illness that put them at risk of contracting Covid-19 and were having difficulties in getting grocery essentials.Sue Davies, the head of consumer protection at Which?, said: “Based on the huge number of reports we’re seeing from vulnerable people struggling to get access to basic food and supplies, it’s clear that the current system is not working for those who need it the most.“Without easily accessible and clearer information for these people, and stronger coordination between the UK’s central and devolved governments, the food industry, local authorities and local charities, there is a risk that many will go hungry during this pandemic.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Which? wants the government to simplify the system for registering for food boxes or prioritised supermarket deliveries to step up efforts to find those who have fallen through the cracks and to coordinate better with charities and the food industry to provide a more consistent service across the UK.James Taylor, the executive director of strategy at Scope, said the consumer group’s findings echoed what his charity had heard from disabled people.“Many have been forced to risk their health to visit supermarkets because they can’t get the deliveries they need,” he said.The government set up a food parcel delivery scheme at the end of last month in an effort to support some of the 1.5 million people it had identified as particularly vulnerable to coronavirus because of conditions such as cancer or severe respiratory illness.“We are determined to ensure the most vulnerable are supported during this pandemic,” said a spokesperson, adding that the government had worked with local authorities, food service specialists and NGOs to deliver at least 900,000 food parcels in nearly five weeks.However, that amounts to about 180,000 a week, a fraction of those requiring help.The Local Government Association said councils in England and Wales needed better data on those needing assistance as well as access to supermarket delivery slots and NHS volunteer responders to assist in shopping for vulnerable iniduals. It emerged this week that 600,000 volunteers were ready to be deployed but many were still waiting to be allocated a task after weeks on standby.The government and devolved administrations have shared their databases on people at risk in England, Wales and Scotland with supermarkets to set aside delivery slots for vulnerable customers. Northern Ireland has yet to do so, however.But the major supermarkets all say they cannot keep up with demand, given that the 1.5 million people identified by the government as particularly vulnerable account for a fraction of those at risk from the virus, estimated to be as many as 16 million.Some very high-risk people told Which? they were struggling to get deliveries or being forced to visit stores, while others had been unable to navigate “complex, confusing and often overwhelmed government and supermarket helplines or other support systems”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd4013ca7475d875ca1426ae688202da595b722/425_0_3213_1930/master/3213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e41af5e9ed4e1eb707956b33d3d2e93c","title":"regulators should be on high alert for virgin media and 02 merger","story":"Parent companies seem to be motivated primarily by the chance to extract a few cost savingsPrepare to be told that the proposed merger of Virgin Media and O2, now officially under discussion, will “reshape” the industry in the UK. In practice it will probably do the opposite. A combination of the biggest cable owner and the biggest mobile operator is far more likely to cement market shares. Regulators should be on high alert.Both parent companies – Liberty Global in Virgin’s case and Spanish group Telefónica with O2 – seem to be motivated primarily by the chance to extract a few cost savings. Making life hell for BT may be well down their list of priorities.John Malone, Liberty’s 79-year-old founder and driving force, is an opportunistic deal-maker who has seen that mobile and fixed-line assets are converging in the age of 5G. He wants a UK mobile partner, which means either O2 or Vodafone.In the case of debt-laden Telefónica, its plan A – a £10bn sale of O2 to Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, owner of Three – was blocked by regulators in 2016. A deal with Liberty is its next best option. Telefónica gets to extract a few billion quid of cash in equalisation payments to make the new venture a 50-50 enterprise. But its UK assets also become less risky in the new converged world.Analysts reckon VirginO2 may be able to save £500m a year in combination, but don’t expect much (or any) of that sum to be redeployed in price cuts for consumers. Instead, we’ll be told the savings are required to fund the next round of investment in broadband and 5G infrastructure.Up to a point, that argument has merit – massive spending on new kit is needed – but it would be nice if competition authorities remembered to extract a few up-front benefits for consumers. Opportunities don’t come along often.Unfortunately, the regulator’s hand is weak. BT’s purchase of EE was approved in 2016 with no competition remedies, which paved the way for the copycat deal now coming into view. Perhaps a merger involving Virgin Media was inevitable, as deal-making investment bankers have been saying for ages, but the logic feels dispiritingly defensive.To no surprise whatsoever, the Financial Reporting Council will investigate EY’s 2018 audit of NMC Health. Less than a year ago, this Abu Dhabi-based operator of private hospitals was a FTSE 100 company worth £4bn. Now it’s in administration and its directors at the end said they (or, rather, their investigator) had unearthed $4bn (£3.2bn) of undisclosed debt. So, yes, an audit postmortem was inevitable.But the wider issues also matter. NMC was a prime example of the London financial market’s love affair with overseas-based companies with few ties to the UK. This open-doors approach to listing in the UK is great for bankers, promoters and exchanges, but who is checking the quality of the arrivals?After past misadventures in the mining sector – think Bumi, out of Indonesia, and ENRC from Kazakhstan – governance rules were supposedly tightened to protect minority investors in firms with controlling shareholders. Now there’s NMC, which was also dominated by a few large investors and could also boast the usual crew of blue-chip advisers (Barclays, JP Morgan Cazenove and HSBC in its case).The Financial Conduct Authority’s inquiry into NMC is therefore as important as the FRC’s investigation into EY. In fact, the process of self-examination would be better if somebody had the job of checking the FCA’s own contribution to London’s love of overseas listings. Were the last set of governance reforms up to scratch?Congratulations to Norwegian Air, which has avoided bankruptcy by wiping out (more or less) its owners and persuading its bondholders and owners of its planes to become shareholders. The mammoth debt-for-equity swap was the price to be paid to secure a government bailout and management got its deal across the line on Monday, which was not a given.Yet the survival of Norwegian also illustrates the truth of the grumbles from Willie Walsh at IAG and Michael O’Leary at Ryanair – an awful lot of economically irrational state support is being given to airlines that were in poor shape before coronavirus. The airline market has also been full of distortions, of course – but never more so than now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/148b98af6c46bf63d7154e5bf444b9e8cb9d9708/0_118_3996_2398/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df0a3d6a5142891364233b0390a0a81","title":"100000 tests results coronavirus self isolation","story":"Delivering the coronavirus tests was the easy part. Now we need mass contact-tracing and self-isolation On Friday health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the UK had achieved its target of carrying out 100,000 tests per day. Of the reported 122,347 tests on 30 April, a total of 27,497 had simply been delivered to people’s homes and 12,872 to other centres. Only a small proportion of those 40,000 tests sent out have been used so far. By Sunday, the figure had dropped to 76,496 to much disconcertion.Are people right to be worried about the number of tests available? There are valid concerns that while the tests are being delivered in high numbers, they may not all be usable. It is still unclear whether tests sent to care homes can be administered by staff, who are currently not registered to carry out nursing tasks. Some have even been sent tests without return envelopes. Despite some friction in the process of rolling out testing, the number of tests actually carried out is still a very impressive achievement.The real concern is our capacity to act on the results of the tests. Simply doing tests in response to demand will be inadequate. Instead we must use each result to find cases, trace those who have been in contact with a person who has tested positive and ensure that those infected, or potentially infected, self-isolate. Only these four steps used in conjunction will prevent a second wave of the virus and protect vulnerable people.Although technology and apps may well help, this exercise will require the mobilisation of thousands of workers to interview cases, identify contacts and take swabs. Contact tracing is a skilled activity, usually done by specially trained nurses or environmental health officers, and we need to ensure that we have enough trained people to do this before we get to that part of the recovery phase.Once cases have been identified, self-isolation will be key to lowering the rate of transmission. People who test positive and those they have been in contact with will have to shut themselves off to the rest of the world for 14 days. For the minority who refuse to do this, strict sanctions may be needed.If testing is not followed up by contact tracing and self-isolation, we run the risk of a large outbreak, as happened in South Korea with Patient 31 and the Shincheonji church. This patient apparently continued to attend the church even though she had symptoms and went on to generate a cluster of more than 4,400 cases of Covid-19.Those who test negative but still exhibit symptoms, especially if they have been in contact with a known case, will have to assume they have the infection. Even in people without symptoms there is no guarantee that 24 hours later they will not be symptomatic and infectious. “Treat the patient, not the test” is an often-repeated truism in medicine and a phrase we are likely to hear more and more as testing is rolled out across the country. On the other hand, people who have tested positive can assume they are immune to reinfection for at least a time.Finally, we must be careful that the data from all the tests being done does not hide the reality of the epidemic from the public. We are now moving from NHS to commercial mass-testing, and all this new testing will push up reported cases dramatically over the coming days. One of the common pitfalls when investigating any outbreak of infectious disease is changing how new cases are identified and counted mid-epidemic. For the time being we must still focus on pillar-one testing – NHS swab testing for those with medical needs and critical key workers – and reported fatalities to show how the epidemic is progressing in the UK rather than on total positives.Despite the concern over figures, we have achieved a remarkable feat in increasing our testing capacity to these levels. We are now faced with the even more challenging task of using that testing capacity, and the results generated, to reduce case numbers, reduce demand for hospital beds and reduce deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecf7dacfcb506887b743629f2459adf4acf83bc/0_409_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e241c504edae928e297622dd97724ad","title":"coronavirus is giving us a glimpse of the future of work and its a nightmare","story":"Women working at home are doing more childcare and housework, while virtual work has no knocking-off time. Will this end along with the lockdown? Don’t bet on itWasn’t it charming when, in 2017, Prof Robert Kelly was giving an interview to the BBC on the shifting relationship between North and South Korea, and his marvellous daughter stomped in followed by his baby in a walker, and then his stressed-out wife dragged the kids out of the way? We loved the way he tried to keep his composure in the storm of domestic chaos. That glimpse of home life: the serious man with his geopolitical analysis and the swagger of his little girl who couldn’t care less … who didn’t relate to that?In work mode, children don’t figure. And now that so many work from home, children must be somehow removed. Women report that, when making Zoom calls, the sight of a child will make them look unprofessional, whereas men fear this less because it makes them look rounded and human. At a certain level of corporate success, this may be so, but for most people the reality of work from home is fraught and muddled.As the pandemic has made visible every inequality, it has also shone a light on the domestic front. Women at home are doing more. More childcare. More home-schooling. More domestic labour. Even if they are working. The old work-life balance, never achieved in the first place, is now even more severely out of whack. Balance? It’s walking a tightrope of competing needs. Virtual work has no knockoff time: email, WhatsApp and the dreaded, supposedly upbeat, Zoom meetings mean workers are available all the time.This inflexibility is then somehow sold as flexibility, but it assumes the worker is always primed for contact. The remote worker is, for some companies, the ideal worker. They don’t need a desk or expensive office space. They don’t need a union. They are malleable and compliant at a time when we are all concerned with the job losses to come. They may not be quite as productive, but they are doing enough to make many big companies think this is the future.This future can sound bright. No more commuting. Everyone can go and live in the countryside, which we have apparently all hankered for during lockdown. We quit the city and can then afford home offices. How very free. Only none of it quite delivers. Most people who talk this talk already have a spare room in their houses. Most of them earn enough and most of them chose self-employment rather than having it foisted upon them.What we do need is to rethink how we work, and the answer cannot be an atomised and depressed workforce.People like to see each other. In real life. If anything, this situation reminded us that there is something about human contact, even eye contact, that no tech can yet produce. Spontaneity and laughter is missing from stilted digital events. Whenever you ask folk about where they got their career breaks or great ideas, it is nearly always from chance encounters a snatched conversation on the way to lunch or being asked to step in when someone else was too busy. But how are young people, who already can’t afford city rents, to work in their cramped flats? When do they get the opportunity to fly, to improvise, to step up to the plate in informal ways? Face-to-face interaction matters. Serendipity is the mother of creation.Certainly, the daft presenteeism and the ending of the standard nine-to-five – an anachronism from the days of factory work – can go. And hopefully a lot of management shibboleths, which have been farcical for decades, will recede, too. One is meetings of enormous numbers of people. When I am king of the world, no meeting will be longer than 10 minutes and, no, not everyone will get to speak. We all know this is a false democracy. In my entire career, the only long meeting I ever attended that needed hours was a case conference to decide the future of a child in care, back when I was a residential social worker. The rest have been displays of ego and territorial pissing. The same goes for brainstorming, another redundant exercise. As Jon Ronson has pointed out, brainstorming is just showtime for extroverts. Everyone else sits there waiting for it to be over. Ideas happen when you are not forcing them. Who doesn’t know that?As we come out of lockdown, a lot of workers will be asked to tolerate some very odd conditions, and this will be done in the appalling business jargon of “resilience”, “restructuring” and “change agents”. The workforce will be told this new way of working promises flexibility – but enforced flexibility is not the same as choice, which is what most want: purposeful work and some autonomy.For too many, work is not purposeful, and lockdown has brought that home, literally – but people need incomes. Those at the bottom of the heap on zero-hours contracts already know that flexibility is a one-way street. Marx talked of four kinds of alienation of labour, and the fourth is when the worker is alienated from other workers. Work is simply an economic practice, and the social elements of production go unrecognised. The great yearning you hear from many now working from home is just this – the social aspect.A post-Covid-19 future must not underestimate the importance of this to economic recovery. The social part is what makes work bearable for many. For the lucky few, work-life balance feels better than it ever was, but for many, I would wager, we are far from that. Everything is work, and life feels baggy and shapeless. There is no break, there is no off-switch, there is no childcare. Instead, we are meant to do it all – all the time. If this is the future, no wonder so many women I know can’t wait to get back to work – just so that they might actually have a moment to themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0feee4aa106d84bf0784048b549bf4366a961d4d/0_291_4394_2638/master/4394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d45f57a09d09d451a0a5468ff8b796ce","title":"the guardian view on italys lockdown no storybook endings","story":"After nine weeks of confinement, Italians are back in the streets. But the most difficult decisions have yet to be made“We are living in the night of the virus,” wrote one academic, soon after Europe’s first Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in Italy. “Living in the dark, because it’s difficult to see what’s happening out there, since we are shut up in our homes.”On Monday Italians entered blinking into the light again, after nine weeks of more or less total confinement, enforced by a combination of fines and moral exhortation. As the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, begins tentatively to reopen the economy, the employees of Ferrari and Lamborghini are returning to their factories, along with other workers in the manufacturing and construction industries. Shops will open in two weeks’ time bars and hairdressers in June. Italians are able to exercise freely at last, stroll through late spring sunshine and visit relatives.Given Italy’s role as a pioneer in the grim endurance test of lockdown, this moment of release feels like a minor landmark. As the northern region of Lombardy became the early European centre of the coronavirus pandemic, its suffering opened a continent’s eyes to the peril that it faced. Images of overwhelmed intensive care units and reports of dying health workers galvanised politicians across Europe. Restrictions were placed on populations that would have been flinched at in late February. On Sunday, Italy reported a daily death toll of 174, the lowest figure since 10 March, confirming that the worst is over for now.Opposition MPs, led by the leader of the League, Matteo Salvini, staged an occupation of parliament on 1 May, calling for a quicker exit from lockdown restrictions. Some members of Mr Conte’s own coalition agree that the pace must be upped. Last week the ratings agency Fitch downgraded Italian bonds to one level above junk status, making the huge and rising national debt less sustainable to maintain. Meanwhile, northern European states have been conspicuously reluctant to share the burden by issuing mutualised debt in the form of so-called coronabonds.In a multifaceted crisis that is only reaching the end of its beginning, there will be no neat endings or satisfying story arcs. Back in March, there was admiration for the colourful displays of collective Italian defiance under lockdown. From the display of rainbow banners bearing the legend “everything is going to be fine” to balcony singing, people found ways to express hope and solidarity. Italians are back in the streets. But in a context of psychological fragility and extreme economic distress, Mr Conte must now find a way to take the measures required to salvage businesses and livelihoods, while protecting his country from a second wave of infections and deaths. It is a dilemma that the British government will soon share."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2632bf740089a7cfe7421d35ea988dcf380930/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b34bcb0c1d8d115e766b740262ac5c7","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from people about the expected return to schools, whether to teach or take their childrenPrime minister Boris Johnson is due to announce on Sunday that children aged 10 and 11 will be the first cohort allowed back into schools from 1 June.

If a great deal of kindness comes out of this, then that will be a plus.”Dench has become an unlikely social media star during the Covid-19 crisis, appearing in videos posted by family members, despite not using social media personally.Last month her daughter, Finty Williams, posted a Twitter video of Dench, wearing a novelty dog hat with pop up ears, saying: “Just keep laughing. That’s all we can do”. It has now been watched 5.4 million times.Earlier this month Dench and her grandson Sam Williams did a TikTok dance to the song Cheryl by the US rapper Yung Gravy. The same week a video of her washing her hands with Gyles Brandreth while reciting ‘The Owl and the Pussy-cat’ went viral.The Vogue interview describes Dench as “a kind of cultural tea cosy to be popped soothingly over the nation’s beleaguered identity in times of crisis.”Dench is photographed in a pink, floral silk organza Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana trench coat for the magazine, which is out on 7 May. In further images she wears a cream silk Armani Prive tunic. Much less stylish, she says, was the costume of the much-maligned Cats film. “The cloak I was made to wear!

See how it transforms a simple spring soupWith its flared top, funnelled length, high heel and spur, Italy is unmistakably a thigh-high boot. It becomes a knee-high boot if you cut it in half, following a line from Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast, to Porto d’Ascoli on the Adriatic one, which is pretty much what the Via Salaria does, give or take the odd curve.The original imprint of the road predates the foundation of Rome, and was the work of an ancient population of settlers and warriors called Sabini. These early routes were created gradually, bit by bit, to move supplies between settlements – the most important of which was sal, salt, produced in salt pans on both coasts from both oceans. Under the Romans, these became the first consular routes and were named – purposefully – Via Salaria. Those marching along the Salt Road were often paid with the valuable substance they transported, which is where the Latin salarium – salary – comes from. Also, the idea of salt as worth and wisdom. Things done cum grano salis, with a grain of salt, are done discerningly, as opposed to foolishly because you have no salt in your head, or in your soup.These last few, persistently rainy days of quarantine, I’ve made even more soup than usual, and also re-read much of Samin Nosrat’s book, Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat. Where would we be without salt? Adrift in a sea of blandness, is her answer, before she hopes: “If one lesson from this book stays with you, let it be this: salt has a greater impact on flavour than any other ingredient. Learn to use it well and your food will taste good.” I can’t help but think that Samin’s attitude to salt is a bit like that of the Sabini, knowing it is at the heart of everything and adding it in the same way they built their salt road – gradually, bit by bit. She recommends getting to know your salt, then adding it at all stages of cooking, because it is what coaxes out flavour.I use two sorts of salt, both from Sicily: sale fino – fine sea salt for seasoning – and sale grosso, tiny, hard-pebble-like sea salt for salting water, which I keep in jars near the cooker. The spoon in the sale grosso pot holds about 10g of it, which is what I add to every litre of water for boiling pasta and vegetables. For fine salt, I use my fingers: a thumb with one finger is 1g, with two fingers is 2g, with three fingers is 6g, and with four it’s 10g – obviously this is all personal and as vague as a home serving of gin. Most of the time I am adding 2g at time and tasting constantly, especially when I am making improvisational soups such as this week’s recipe.Samin mentions how the chef Judy Rodgers often told her chefs a dish needed seven grains of salt. I read lots of food writing and few things stick, but Judy’s seven grains and Samin’s salting – doing so every step of the way, like the Sabini – have adhered like sticky seeds to a woolly jumper reminders of the need to taste and adjust salt discerningly.It is hard to judge for salt when food is scalding hot sitting alters flavour, so leave it to sit before tasting and adjusting salt and pepper – if indeed it needs it.6 tbsp olive oil1 onion, diced1 celery stick, dicedA sprig of rosemarySalt1 medium potato, diced400g courgettes1.5 litres water2 tins cannellini beans2 thick slices stale breadDried oreganoOlive oil, for fryingPut the olive oil, onion, celery, rosemary and a pinch of salt in a large, heavy-based pan and set over a medium flame. Cook, stirring until the onion is starting to soften and turn translucent. Add the potato and another small pinch of salt, stir, then add the water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.Meanwhile trim the courgettes, cut into four lengthways and then into quarter moons about 3mm thick. Drain and rinse the beans, then taste them to see how salty they are.Once the soup has been simmering for 10 minutes, add the courgettes and the beans, and continue simmering for another 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Check salt and pepper, and set aside for at least an hour.When you are ready to eat, reheat the soup. Cut the bread into 2cm squares. In a separate pan, warm a little olive oil, add the bread, sprinkle with salt and dried oregano, and fry until golden. Serve alongside the soup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1af1beecb595e70a904bb5d1dd17e2059156f0c7/324_94_2563_1538/master/2563.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12c531d948ecaeb8d82c71633d6c0b1","title":"liverpool ask for more time in pursuit of 527m target timo werner","story":"Liverpool have told Timo Werner’s representatives they need more time to decide on whether to make a formal offer for the Germany international as they wait to see what impact coronavirus will have on the next transfer window.Werner is keen to leave this summer after four years at RB Leipzig and Liverpool are in pole position to sign the 24-year-old, having made clear their interest in him several months ago. Werner is keen for a new challenge abroad and has told Bayern Munich that a move to another Bundesliga club is not an option at the moment.Contrary to reports, the release clause in the striker’s contract – which stands at €60m (£52.7m) – is still valid. Liverpool are keen to get more of an understanding in the next few weeks of what will happen to this summer’s transfer window before completing any deal.The coronavirus pandemic is likely to distort the market this summer, even for the top clubs, and Liverpool are not ready to commit to spending €60m on one player. Jürgen Klopp is a huge admirer of Werner, who has 72 goals in 118 league appearances for Leipzig, and the striker was set to be Liverpool’s top target this summer if they were to invest in a squad that is 25 points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.Several other clubs are also interested in Werner depending on how other transfer business goes.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

They married months later and now live in Hollywood, FloridaCarol Natelson and Ray Bertoia had been travelling the world for years working in casinos when they met on a cruise ship in 1995. “I was working on another ship and was moved to her ship by pure chance,” he says. “As I was boarding, I spotted her outside a cabin reading a magazine. I just knew straight away that she was the one for me.”Carol, who is American, had sworn off dating, but, despite her reservations, romance blossomed quickly. “I thought he was cute and then we ended up spending lots of time together,” she says. They shared their first kiss on the island of Mayreau in the Grenadines. “We pretty much became a couple within two weeks of meeting. We had so much fun it was like being on a holiday.”They spent three months together onboard the ship, before Carol’s contract finished. “I still had six months left, but there was no way I was staying on the ship without her,” says Ray, who is originally from Scotland.Although he had been planning a career working in the cruise casino industry, Ray didn’t hesitate to leave for Carol. They disembarked in Los Angeles, before heading to Palm Springs, where she found work in a local casino. It was hard work and long hours, but they loved the lifestyle. “We were in the pool one day when I asked her to marry me,” says Ray. “We went to Las Vegas in June to get hitched. Our witnesses included Carol’s sister and a few people we’d met on the ship.” The marriage meant Ray could start working at the same casino in Palm Springs. “Our wedding happened so fast that I don’t think anyone thought we’d last,” laughs Carol. “But here we are, 25 years later.”The couple built a home for themselves in Palm Springs. They kept up their passion for travel with regular trips to Europe. “Ray learnt to sail, too,” says Carol. “One of the things that I love most about him is that he is always up for anything and he likes to do different things.”She also loves his honesty and caring nature: “He doesn’t just care about me, he cares about everyone.” Ray says they have always been on the same wavelength. “I just liked her from the first moment. She loves an adventure and she’s a fantastic cook. I think when you know, you just know.”In 2009, Ray became seriously ill due to complications from erticulitis, a digestive condition, and ended up on life support in a coma. His mother died while he was in hospital and it took him a long time to recover. For the next three months, Carol nursed him back to health. “Without her, I don’t know what I would have done,” he says.The couple had always dreamed of moving to the beach. In 2017, they took the plunge and bought a new home in Hollywood, Florida. “We have lots of family here. We can look out of the window and see the cruise ships,” says Carol. Ray found a job at the Hard Rock guitar casino when they moved.He is currently out of work due to the pandemic, but says they are “very lucky”. “We were meant to be going on a cruise to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year,” says Carol. “But we’ll just have to wait a bit longer.”Although Ray was 39 and Carol was 42 when they married, it was the first wedding for both of them. “Before Ray, I was always choosing the wrong guy,” says Carol. “It’s been so great to be with someone who I can always count on to be there for me.”Want to share your story?

It overlooks our quiet leafy street, and I love it.”She adds: “However, my desk isn’t usually as messy as this. Working from home with kids in a pandemic is an absolute shit show.

Next up: the band of feuding brothers who expanded pop’s horizonsThe Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society (1968)When the Kinks’ abominable onstage behaviour caused the American Federation of Musicians to bar the group from ever returning to the US, Ray and Dave Davies had a rethink about where their music stood in relation to British culture. The brothers, born and bred in Muswell Hill, north London, had never hit it off, and touring tended to bring out the worst in them. But their masterwork, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, testified to their uncanny knack of overriding personal animosity, joining hands around a unity of creative purpose, when in a recording studio.The 1965 American ban was undoubtedly a blow. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones led the so-called British invasion of the US, reaping the considerable financial rewards, and when Village Green Preservation Society was released in 1968, questions were raised about whether the Kinks had become parochial and out of touch. As Jimi Hendrix released Electric Ladyland and the Rolling Stones were moving from the psychedelic Their Satanic Majesties Request to the hard-driving Beggars Banquet, the opening track of the Kinks’ new one was apparently an ode to the England of Enid Blyton or John Betjeman, extolling the delights of strawberry jam, warm real ale, custard pies and Sherlock Holmes mysteries. And also virginity, a paradox given the Kinks’ well-documented sexual adventures although, as Ray Davies subsequently made clear, this album was all about treasuring and preserving precious things that, once gone, are gone for ever.Witty, surreal and sharply observed, the album evoked the visions of William Blake, Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll – with perhaps a touch of the Goon Show – over anything to do with dreary, self-satisfied English nostalgia. The high level of musical invention tells you as much. The from-the-earth-up funk of earlier Kinks hits such as You Really Got Me is jettisoned in favour of music seemingly disembodied from everyday reality, which keeps vanishing down rabbit holes. Memory, myths, timelines smudge. Picture Book sketches a scene of old-age reminiscence over family photographs, while Do You Remember Walter? could equally be Ray, then in his mid-20s, remembering local character Walter – or projecting himself into old age.Materialising out of the mists like Turner’s painting The Great Western Railway, Last of the Steam-Powered Trains rides over a riff borrowed from Willie Dixon, which bumps into an uplifting, up-the-scale chord sequence that reappears in the much-loved Kinks song, Days. Big Sky – dramatic, anthemic chords and Ray’s searing narration – gives a Blakean snapshot of the cosmos, while kittenish, mischievous flutes introduce Phenomenal Cat, a simple and touching reminiscence of a once adored feline. All life is here.Something Else By the Kinks (1967)The artfully organised Something Else By the Kinks is the obvious pick of the pre-Village Green bunch. Any album that kicks off with David Watts – inspired by a post-gig party at the home of a local dignitary that ended with everyone getting naked, and Ray offering to trade Dave for the Watts mansion – and finishes with the eternal London love song Waterloo Sunset, is going to be an instant classic. But also on offer: Dave Davies’ best song, Death of a Clown, the Kurt Weill-like Harry Rag and (on the reissue) the mesmerising Autumn Almanac, for which chord sequences were snipped up and reversed to make the melodic line meet itself coming the other way.Arthur or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire (1969)This project had its roots in a television play that was dropped, but Ray’s music was too good to abandon. Released in album form in the aftermath of Village Green, Arthur shares its ambition and themes of what it meant to be British. The original play told the story of Arthur, a carpet-layer who escaped the postwar gloom by emigrating to Australia. The track, Australia, is as far as the Kinks ever went into freely evolving trippy, ecstatic instrumental improvisation. And Arthur opens with another defining Kinks hit, Victoria.Fast forward into the 70s, and the Kinks went through a commercial lean patch when Ray’s ostentatious concept albums, Preservation Volumes 1 and 2, Soap Opera and Schoolboys in Disgrace, failed to convince the fans – or even Dave Davies. Now signed to Clive Davis’s Arista label, the Kinks reverted to being an honest-to-goodness rock’n’roll band, but never lost the essence of their art. Juke Box Music is typically double-edged: a woman spends her days marooned inside the lyrics of her favourite pop songs, a disconcerting scenario transformed into something joyful. Mr Big Man is unapologetically, infectiously funky Full Moon gets progressively darker as Ray sings about madness and isolation.To the Bone (1994)Dropped by major labels and with tensions between the brothers escalating (Ray trampled over Dave’s birthday cake during his 50th-birthday celebrations), the Kinks limped into the mid-90s, eventually crashing and burning in 1996. To the Bone, their exquisite farewell, mixed earlier live material with tracks recorded in front of an invited audience at Konk Studios in Crouch End, London. Lola, Tired of Waiting, Celluloid Heroes, Come Dancing et al were captured in fresh versions, while A Gallon of Gas was a freewheeling blues track, Dave and Ray exploring the roots of popular music as they had done 30 years earlier as teenagers, up the road in Muswell Hill. The Kinks had come full circle.Kink: An Autobiography, by Dave Davies (1997)Dave Davies lays bare his soul in this autobiography written during the dying days of the Kinks: his troubled relationship with Ray, his struggles with drugs and drink, but also the creative highs, all documented.X-Ray, by Ray Davies (1994)Ray presented his autobiography in the form of a dystopian, semi-fictional novel, as a narrator hired by The Corporation is tasked with finding, then interviewing an aged rock star.God Save the Kinks, by Rob Jovanovic (2013)There are many other books about the Kinks, but Jovanovic’s account is a both a page-turner and expertly researched.

Meanwhile, the singer Mabel and actors David Hasselhoff and Matt Lucas have revealed what they will be doing once the restrictions end.With travel curbs in place, one enterprising goose has taken advantage of the now quiet railway station at York by taking up residence in a flowerbed and laying four eggs.British Transport Police first spotted the bird, nicknamed Mother Goose, two weeks ago but presumed she had moved on when they did not see her for a couple of days.She has since returned, laid four eggs and can be seen patrolling the railway station, sometimes with a companion. Staff – who are posting updates on social media – have placed some fencing around the flowerbed for safety. “It’s such a gorgeous, gorgeous story and we all need a bit of this in our lives at the moment,” said a spokeswoman for LNER, which owns the station.What do you dream of doing once the lockdown ends? Stars reveal all in a video launching the Prince’s Trust campaign, Looking Forward, to encourage us to share positive vibes on social media and help us feel happier.Mabel says: “The first thing I’m going to do when I get out of isolation is go to the studio.” Hasselhoff will head straight to the beach: “No, not Brighton beach, Baywatch beach where I belong.” Lucas, meanwhile, jokes: “When all this is over I’m looking forward to just staying in, just relaxing at home for a bit and for a change.”Apart from showing their appreciation for frontline staff, Worcester residents have been advised of an extra benefit of their weekly “clap for carers”. The city council has tried a number of measures to target a “significant” problem with gulls, said to include noise and mess and even attacks. In one area, the use of acoustic devices that emit recorded gull distress calls is being trialled to deter them from nesting on city rooftops. Now one resident has reported gulls flew during the applause.Lockdown, with less waste discarded in the city centre, had reduced the gulls’ food supply, Joy Squires, the chair of the council’s environment committee told the BBC. “I’d also encourage Worcester residents to keep on clapping and cheering in support of key workers. Not only is it helping to raise morale, but it appears to be helping to keep our gull population at bay too,” she said.Kat Tate, a wildlife rescuer, has been causing some double-takes on her daily exercise walk around Walcott, Norfolk, as she is not only accompanied by her two dogs but also her tame kookaburra, Siren.Siren was a star of educational events and school talks, but since lockdown, he has become restless and bored. “So we just decided to take him out with the dogs on our daily walk to see if it helped lift his mood,” said Tate. “He absolutely loved it and seemed to perk up and come alive whilst out, so we just made a habit of bringing him with us.”Derbyshire siblings William and Sophie Lacey, 15 and 7, have taken lockdown to new levels by camping for one month in their garden in aid of a local hospice. The two spent the whole of April in a tent at their home in Borrowash, raising more than £2,200 for Treetops Hospice Care in Risley, Derbyshire.“It was cold sometimes and water sometimes got in from the sides but it was all good otherwise,” William told the BBC. Julie Heath, the chief executive of the hospice, said: “Between them, they’ve raised enough for the hospice to provide three more weeks of overnight nursing care for some of our most poorly patients out in the community.”• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9379b1dd9ffb5b345e58a768759c94ebd873b65/0_166_4993_2995/master/4993.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=89e83b138e106aff5c1d0e719245aa0b","title":"the global race for face masks podcast","story":"The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask.

For one man, Ovidiu Olea, a businessman in Hong Kong, it was the start of a wild ride from mask buyer to mask dealer to ultimately, mask producer.  writer Samanth Subramanian caught up with him as he begins production. He tells Rachel Humphreys about how distortions in the mask market have led to diplomatic incidents. But with mask sales rocketing and many governments starting to either recommend or insist on their use, the evidence about their efficacy is still inconclusive. And some fear that widespread rush to buy up stocks will prevent them reaching the people who need them most: frontline workers and medics.

These will work alongside the new app, in a bid to establish how and where the disease is spreading.Users who experience symptoms will be asked to notify the app and will then be offered a test. Access to the app will initially be offered to NHS staff on the island, with members of the public receiving a letter on Thursday urging them to download the app and join the trial.Questions have been raised about the app’s effectiveness. A report in the Health Service Journal on Monday – flatly denied by the government as “factually untrue” – quoted sources that claimed it was not fit for inclusion in the NHS’s own app library, had not passed basic cybersecurity tests and was still “wobbly”. It also said there were concerns about how users’ privacy would be protected once they logged symptoms and became traceable.The NHS’s decision to take a centralised approach has also been criticised. Alan Davidson and Marshall Erwin of the not-for-profit internet organisation Mozilla said: “The biggest problem … is that it would expand government access to the ‘social graph’ – data about you, your relationships, and your links with others.“Regardless of the particulars, we know this social graph data is near impossible to truly anonymise. It will provide information about you that is highly sensitive, and can easily be abused for a host of unintended purposes.”Apple and Google proposed a decentralised alternative, in which the contact tracing would happen on inidual phones, rather than on the NHS’s servers, and which would allow them to sign up the vast numbers of users it needs.Hancock gave further details on the app at Monday’s daily Downing Street press conference, where he also confirmed that the total reported number of deaths from Covid-19 was now 28,734 – an increase of 288.The health secretary called the creation of a contact-tracing system a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity”. He said he expected to have the system in place by the middle of this month.Hancock had previously said 18,000 contact tracers might be needed – but he said he would adjust that figure if a new survey showed the virus was more prevalent than previously thought. The Office for National Statistics is carrying out a large-scale survey in a bid to create a clearer picture about how many people have contracted the virus.Hancock was accompanied by the deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam, who gave an update on the government’s five tests for lifting the lockdown, which has now been in place for six weeks.He said that while the data showed the government was in a good position on passing the first test, a sustained fall in daily deaths, there was still a deep scientific discussion going on about the fifth test concerning avoiding a second peak.He added that the government wanted to see the number of new Covid-19 cases falling before it considered it safe to lift the restrictions. “New cases need to come down further,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75ef7cb620abb2e2c647c6e4644e520f848ff60/0_171_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d1406f2200ecc2e13f41e4875336b3","title":"jennie formby resigns as labour party general secretary","story":"Close ally of Jeremy Corbyn steps down, signalling major shift of direction for partyJennie Formby, the Labour general secretary who was a close ally of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, has resigned from the post, the party has announced.The move gives the party leader, Sir Keir Starmer, an opportunity to anoint a new candidate to control the party machine, and is further illustration of a major political shift since December’s general election. A statement released on behalf of Formby on Monday said: “When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace.“It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down.“I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill-health.“I wish Keir and Angela the very best of luck in taking the party forward and leading Labour to victory at the next general election.”Formby, a former Unite official and close associate of Len McCluskey, took over as general secretary, the party’s most senior employee, in March 2018. She received treatment for breast cancer last year.Allies of Starmer had said privately her resignation would be key to allowing the new leader to control the direction of the party.A meeting of the national executive committee will be expected to set a timetable to elect a new general secretary.Potential candidates to succeed Formby are thought to include the Unite political director, Anneliese Midgley, the Unison official Emilie Oldknow and GMB’s director of external relations, Lisa Johnson.Allies of Oldknow and Johnson say it is no coincidence that they have been linked to recent controversies after they were flagged as potential successors to Formby.Oldknow has been accused making inappropriate comments about colleagues in the controversial antisemitism report being investigated by the NEC.Johnson has been closely connected to Tim Roache, the recently resigned GMB general secretary who is under investigation for inappropriate conduct. Her supporters insist she was among the senior figures pushing for his resignation in recent days.Formby’s resignation means that most of left of the party, which until December’s general election controlled all key positions, have been removed.Focus will now fall on whether Karie Murphy, another key Corbyn ally, will remain as a senior member of the party’s leadership.Responding to the decision, Starmer said: “I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.“Jennie has led our party’s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “As a trade unionist and party activist as well as general secretary, Jennie has been a great servant of our movement for many years and blazed a trail as one of our highest achieving women.“She goes with our thanks and gratitude, and I’ve no doubt she will stand squarely behind us as we continue to fight for social justice and the Labour government our country so desperately needs.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740ce47955049948ba812aec94544da8689695fd/0_0_4972_2984/master/4972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461992622bd9fe3fdadd9fc176e937ae","title":"labour general secretary starmers runners and riders","story":"Potential candidates for the role vacated by Jennie Formby at the top of the party machineWhoever becomes Labour’s next general secretary will have to win over most of the party’s national executive committee, where Sir Keir Starmer now commands a slim majority. Here are some potential candidates for the role.Chief of staff to Starmer, with strong local government connections, the former campaign director of Liz Kendall’s failed leadership bid would be a popular choice among MPs and those loyal to the new leader. But he may struggle to win support from the unions, who traditionally occupy the role of general secretary.Among the favourites to replace Formby, the director of external relations at the GMB union is known as an extremely capable backroom dealer who has guided the union through tricky times with employers and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Her allies say she was among union officials who urged the GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, to step down last week.The Unison official and Labour’s executive director for governance, membership and party services was seen as a frontrunner for the job until a controversial leaked antisemitism report claimed she had made inappropriate comments about colleagues. She has denied any wrongdoing.A popular member of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, she would be expected to command the support of many on the left of the party. She may suffer objections from some Starmer supporters because, like Formby, she is a Unite-backed official and is closely associated with Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.Scottish Labour’s former general secretary stood down in August after a row about the party’s position on a second independence referendum. He has been mentioned as a possible candidate by some on the right of the party.Some Labour sources have hinted that Starmer may wish to break with tradition and look for a candidate outside the party – an organiser from a third-sector body who will shake up the structures of the party without setting up their own power base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d726785cfde8949db9788b814546ecd2ec14951/435_322_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7de5cee8e0a5916e4aeb0ee7834c930","title":"no 10 facing fresh calls for transparency over sage pandemic advice","story":"Government publishes names of 50 members of experts’ group but list is incompleteDowning Street is facing fresh calls for transparency about the expert advice it receives after it published the names of 50 experts who sit on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which discusses how to handle the coronavirus epidemic.The list of names, which is not complete, was released after critics raised questions about the secrecy of Sage and the  revealed that Boris Johnson’s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, had played an active role in Sage meetings.The group’s membership and the nature of its advice have come under scrutiny, with critics arguing that Britain has botched key aspects of its pandemic response even as ministers claimed they were following “the best science”.The list contains the bulk of the Sage membership as well as the names of experts who sit on subgroups that specialise in issues such as outbreak modelling, behavioural science and the spread of infection in schools and hospitals.The list includes 24 instances of people asking for their names not to be made public, though some may be duplicates, as experts can sit on more than one group. Two members of Sage asked not to be named.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, has warned that the purity of the scientific advice reaching the prime minister is being put at risk by the presence of political appointees such as Cummings. He said publication of the names was “a good first step” but not enough to reassure people.“What we want to see is what Sage is discussing, what their advice is, what the advice of the scientists is as distinct from that of the strategy advisers. It’s certainly a good step, but there’s a lot more to be done,” he said. On Monday, King convened the first open meeting of an “independent Sage” group, with a dozen experts whose names were made public beforehand.Around half of the members of Sage are scientific advisers from government departments, public health officials and senior NHS staff, with the other half coming from universities, the list shows.The members include David Halpern, head of the Cabinet Office’s behavioural insights team, or “nudge unit”, Prof Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, who attends as chair of the society’s Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics (Delve) Group, and Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University.The government stated that while the meetings were “regularly attended by officials from Her Majesty’s government”, their names were excluded from the publication list, though it did not explain why.The advisory group is co-chaired by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser and Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer. The names were not made public before, Vallance has said, because of concerns over members’ personal security and fears of outside influence.James Wilsdon, digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said publication of the names was “a welcome step” adding that “openness and transparency must now become the default operating mode across the Sage process”.“Too much rests on the interpretation of evidence, dilemmas and uncertainties in this crisis for the process to take place behind closed doors,” he said. “We’re in a situation of what some call ‘post-normal’ science, where the facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, stakes are high and decisions are urgent.“We need Sage to respond accordingly, start treating the public as grown-ups, and throw open its workings to wider engagement, debate and scrutiny,” he added.Philip Bath, professor of stroke medicine at Nottingham University, said: “It is very important to see who is involved in Sage and its supporting groups so that the public know who is involved, their expertise and whether they are representative of the population in respect of geography and protected characteristics.”He said he was struck by how many of the experts came from the “golden triangle” of London, Oxford and Cambridge, and why experts were not drawn from around the UK. He said the list should be improved by naming each expert’s “base speciality”, including for those who did not agree to be named.Derek Hill, an expert in medicine and medical device regulation at University College London, said that given the importance of medical devices in dealing with Covid-19, from personal protective equipment to temperature sensors to ventilators, Sage appeared to lack expertise on medical devices and the regulatory system.“This is very relevant as it impacts the risk associated with implementing some aspects of Sage advice, which should be captured in such advice. Such experts are likely to have an engineering background, and are likely to have experience in industries well as academia,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52629910a249dbd58990c90ea765eef84cb3be1/0_31_7575_4545/master/7575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853404f243e5833f27cda5f7006c7e8a","title":"uk behind most european states in tackling coronavirus says agency","story":"Disease control centre delivers blow to Boris Johnson’s claims of successful strategyThe head of the EU’s agency for disease control has warned that the UK is one of five European countries failing to reduce active coronavirus infections, despite Boris Johnson’s claims of success.Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), suggested on Monday that the UK had yet to progress as far as the majority of European countries in tackling the disease.In evidence to the European parliament’s committee on public health, Ammon said Europe as a whole appeared to have passed the peak of infections on Saturday, with only Bulgaria still experiencing an increase in cases of infection.But she told MEPs that the UK, along with Poland, Romania and Sweden, stood out as showing “no substantial changes in the last 14 days”.“All the others, we really see this substantial decrease,” Ammon said of the cumulative incidence rate, which provides a measure of the prevalence of active cases in the population. She did not offer any explanation of the differences.The ECDC monitors all 27 EU member states plus the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.The agency reported that as of Monday there had been 1.2 million confirmed cases of infection, with 136,347 deaths within the territory it monitors.The UK has recorded 186,599 confirmed cases and 28,466 fatalities, a death count second only to Italy, according to the ECDC’s latest data. Only the US has suffered more deaths.Last week, Johnson claimed that Britain had gone past the peak and was “on the downward slope”.The government has warned of the difficulties in making international comparisons, with the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, insisting that while the government “will have made mistakes” the evidence will need to be assessed in the future.But Ammon’s suggestion that the UK is yet to show the sustained improvement seen elsewhere in Europe offers some grounds for caution as Downing Street seeks to champion its efforts to reduce the rate of infection.It has been suggested in Whitehall that a better insight into the relative success of governments will be found in the increase of excess deaths during the pandemic, rather than just those officially recorded as being related to Covid-19.But an EU-backed project monitoring all excess deaths during the pandemic reported that England had seen the highest rise in deaths over the five-year average compared with Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.She warned, however, against any complacency and suggested that her agency had little confidence that the reporting of deaths and infections was complete.A government spokesman said: “The UK’s approach throughout this pandemic has been guided by the latest scientific evidence.“We have seen a marked decline in both daily confirmed cases and deaths in recent weeks and our published data clearly shows this.“Other countries may be at different stages of the outbreak and there is variety in how they record and report deaths, so comparisons can be unhelpful, inaccurate and misleading”.Researchers at the University of Bonn suggested on Monday that more than 10 times as many people in Germany had probably been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, following a field trial in one of the worst-hit towns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2ba7e011ad2c57d78d56185dfcad12ca96084b/17_70_1007_604/master/1007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2344e65c114ec022f370e8bafb80b0e1","title":"did you solve it are you smarter than an 8 year old","story":"The solutions to today’s puzzlesEarlier today I set you the following four puzzles from my new book, Football School: the Ultimate Puzzle Book:1.

The number of pregnant prisoners plus inmates in MBUs was about 70 at the time the justice secretary announced plans to release the majority from prison in late March, but by late April fewer than half had been released.The government’s female offenders strategy, published in June 2018 when David Gauke was justice secretary, included plans to develop a pilot for at least five residential women’s centres across England and Wales.The plans to open a residential women’s centre come as the government released £2.5m of funding for community services across England and Wales, which support women at risk of being drawn into crime. The funding, which will be awarded later this year, will help cover core costs such as wages, rent and bills to services that could include domestic abuse support, drug and alcohol rehabilitation or work with a particular group such as women from minority ethnic communities.The support is on top of the £750m coronavirus crisis package for charities announced by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a057fe3f69f60def7588bf68b8c81eaca66f0a2a/0_621_4335_2599/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=066537c2661e5189658efbc0e021f434","title":"nfl set to move london games back to us during covid 19 pandemic","story":"The NFL has decided to move its international games back to the US for the 2020 season as the sports world deals with the Covid-19 pandemic.The league had scheduled four games in London and one in Mexico City, but they will now be moved back to the stadiums of the host teams.The Jacksonville Jaguars, who have been regular visitors to London in recent years, were the ‘home team’ for two games at Wembley.

The invention is intended to speed up the return of cricket to our screens by removing one health hazard.Covid-19 has made the long-established method of shining a cricket ball, which involves applying sweat and saliva to its surface (with or without the assistance of Murray mints), a dangerous process for the designated ball-polisher in the field.Brett Elliot, the group managing director of Kookaburra and presumably a swing bowler, explained the plan. “Kookaburra’s research and development centre has been working on a product to replace the traditional methods of polishing a ball that could be controlled and managed by the match umpire.“We have developed a unique wax formula for polishing a cricket ball. The pocket-size sponge applicator will enable umpires or players to apply a thin layer of wax which could then be rubbed and polished in the traditional manner to enhance the shine on the ball.” The new wonder wax should be ready within a month.The laws of cricket explicitly state the fielding side must not use “artificial substances” to alter the condition of the ball, so the MCC, s of the laws, will have to give its blessing to what will hopefully be a short-term change if the applicator is to be used this summer.Tests would have to be undertaken not only on Kookaburra balls but also on Duke balls used in England, given there is still the possibility of Tests behind closed doors this summer against West Indies and Pakistan.This innovation can be only admired even though it poses an interesting dilemma for the lawmakers, especially since ball-tampering has been such a controversial problem in recent times, especially in Australia.One moment the authorities are applying handcuffs, the next they are handing over the key. If the experiments in Australia are successful there could be some interesting repercussions. If the balls keep swinging there will inevitably be a race among the scientists of the various cricket boards to unlock the magic formula discovered by Kookaburra. And Jimmy Anderson may undertake to keep playing for another five years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00f8e42a10bf12c99b67bbe774f2ff038a7ad51/0_129_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fcd8fc69257af27c86808375db068c5","title":"world rugby guidelines advise behind closed doors tests until vaccine found","story":"Elite rugby matches are likely to be played behind closed doors until an effective coronavirus vaccine is freely available, according to guidelines released by World Rugby.The document, compiled by World Rugby’s leading medical experts, raises the possibility of the autumn Tests, next year’s Six Nations and even the British \u0026amp Irish Lions tour of South Africa being played in empty stadiums or in front of radically reduced attendances.The guidelines also advise that no competitive matches should even take place until governments allow gatherings of 250 people, casting major doubt on the completion of the 2019-20 Premiership season.On Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to announce a gradual easing of the lockdown but it is highly likely that only small gatherings will be allowed. Indeed, it has been suggested that gatherings could be limited to 10 people until next year, which, according to World Rugby’s guidelines, could mean no competitive matches at all until 2021. If they are permitted, it is suggested they take place without large scale crowds, until a vaccine is readily available, which could take up to 18 months. “Large traditional crowds are unlikely in the absence of an effective and freely available vaccine for Covid-19,” reads the document, compiled by Eanna Falvey, Prav Mathema, Mary Horgan and Martin Rafferty.After he was re-elected as World Rugby’s chairman, Bill Beaumont explained how a bumper set of autumn fixtures was likely with the July tours certain to be cancelled and potentially rescheduled for October. Playing all matches behind closed doors would come as a financial hammer blow to the Rugby Football Union and the rest of the home nations, however. The RFU can generate around £10m from Twickenham tests and the forecast £50m losses over the next 18 months are based on the assumption that England’s four November matches go ahead as planned.Before competitive matches return however, World Rugby details a graduation process of clubs and unions returning to full contact training. When gatherings of 10 people are allowed, World Rugby advises that inidual and a small group training would be allowed “in a staggered manner according to a country’s healthcare system and testing capacity”. Premiership clubs have advised players to prepare for the first stage of training from 1 June but World Rugby advises against handshakes and hugging, while a distance of 1.5 metres should be kept between players and face masks should be worn when possible.When gatherings of up to 50 people are allowed, full squad training would be permitted but daily screening would be necessary and World Rugby warns “if a player or staff becomes an infected person each other player and staff member would be close contacts and will require testing and quarantine”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5b749f203e898b7c29a8107f5b2226cea001733/0_174_5375_3225/master/5375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3611301ff0820633090152de1f064440","title":"amazon tim bray resigns working conditions coronavirus","story":"Tim Bray’s departure comes as company faces increased scrutiny and employee activism around its Covid-19 responseTim Bray, a top engineer and vice-president at Amazon, announced on Monday he is resigning “in dismay” over the company’s firing of employee activists who criticized working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic.Bray’s resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave protest working conditions and inadequate safety protections.In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company “chickenshit”, and said they were “designed to create a climate of fear”. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions.“Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said. previously published Bray’s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request.Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa – two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers.Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls – all of whom were fired  after organizing.A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with Jeff Bezos.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees.Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn.“At the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response,” Bray said. “It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d1a5bf8d0300051d7192377c89030ee9114bb80/97_4_1768_1061/master/1768.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=427c308c49da2a30f819e2f0d0accd70","title":"tell us about your happy place readers travel tips","story":"Share with fellow readers that special place that makes you smile at just the thought of it, so even under lockdown you can escape in your mind’s eyeIs it a splendid hilltop where the views stretch out forever, a square in your favourite city or a sandy beach untouched except for the shack selling cold drinks and fresh fish?

So I’m dealing with this on a personal level far better than I would have anticipated.”Brooker said he was not working on another Black Mirror, which first aired on Channel 4 before being bought by Netflix, as he did not think there was the appetite for it in the current climate.But the writer said he was optimistic about the future. “If you look at what happens in classic dystopian fiction – where everyone turns on each other immediately – so far that hasn’t happened. It’s not to say it won’t. But I pivoted quite early to an optimistic view that this is terrible but, at the end of it, there’s a possibility that we’ll have the stomach to realign society a little.“Is this forcing our hands to address financial inequality and climate change? You hope that’s the outcome, rather than that it makes psychotic strongman politicians more secure.”Brooker will return to TV screens this month with a special lockdown version of his weekly news review show Screenwipe, titled Antiviral Wipe. The BBC said the first show on 14 May would feature the regular characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell), offering their “own very special brand of in-depth reporting”.A press release announcing the show in April said other contributors would also be involved, but that they could not be named as they “haven’t been told they’re doing it yet, but have no good excuse not to”.Brooker said: “The BBC asked me to supply a quote for the press release, which is what you’re reading now.”Brooker has been congratulated for producing work that with hindsight seems impressively prescient. As Germany entered lockdown in March, the contestants of the country’s Big Brother were left unaware of what was happening in the outside world – drawing comparisons with Brooker’s 2008 series Dead Set, about reality TV show contestants who emerge to find a zombie apocalypse.“Okay, fuck it,” tweeted Brooker when the parallels were pointed out. “This is happening so frequently I’m just going to have to accept that I’m a soothsayer or a mystic or whatever you want to call it.”He added: “With that in mind, I will now make an optimistic prediction in the hope it also comes true: we’ll come out the other side of the coronavirus crisis a more empathetic, altruistic, and globally conscious society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9b05fe0a96309fd82d7b3d79911af09b16be13/0_297_4492_2697/master/4492.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1e8e07c57708afde1466621021f030fa","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

But they are nervous about getting involved in an escalating international situation.On Sunday Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”No evidence was offered by Pompeo to back up his assertion but information has been circulating over the last month in the UK, US and Australia aimed at raising questions about the high security Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has long specialised in researching coronaviruses in horseshoe bats.Stories have suggested that workers in the lab may not have always used full protective equipment, and that in one instance a bat urinated on a researcher who did not subsequently become ill.But there is nothing to indicate a leak from the lab could have caused the pandemic, sources say.Claims are even made that the virus was genetically engineered in Wuhan, although there is both scientific and intelligence agency agreement that there is no evidence for this.American scientists who have worked with the Wuhan Institute add its safety standards are comparable to Western equivalents – and the prevailing theory is that the virus was passed onto humans via one of the country’s live animal markets.Australia’s Daily  – a Sydney tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch – has been focusing on the Wuhan lab for several days, culminating in a weekend report which cited a 15-page dossier compiled, it said, by “concerned Western governments” amid an investigation by British and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies.Intelligence sources in Australia were quick to say they believed it was based on open source, public domain material. One told the  they believed the information that appeared in the News Corp title was most likely to have originally come from the US: “My instinct is that it was a tool for building a counter-narrative and applying pressure to China. So it’s the intent behind it that’s most important. So possibly open source leads with a classification slapped on it.”Downing Street said that the UK did not comment on intelligence matters – although British sources also said they did not recognise the dossier as based on classified information provided by the country’s spy agencies.Downing Street said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but a No 10 spokesman said: “Clearly there are questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure we are better prepared for future global pandemics.”Neil O’Brien, a Conservative MP and secretary of the China Research Group, said that Beijing could help fend off speculation with greater transparency: “If their government were less secretive and authoritarian they would cooperate more and so potentially put to bed wilder ideas about the origins of the virus.”Last week, the New York Times reported that White House officials, led by deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, a former China reporter with the Wall Street Journal, pressed the US agencies to gather information that could support any lab theory.A report in the Washington Post two weeks later highlighted a leak of US diplomatic cables from 2018, claiming that a site visit showed the WIV had insufficient appropriately trained technicians for the high security work.The lab itself says it is distressed by talk of leaks. Scientific American re-edited an interview with the virologist Shi Zhengli last week to address “the tenuous suggestion” of the lab theory, and noted the “genetic sequence” of Sars-CoV-2, the scholarly term for coronavirus, “does not match any her lab had previously studied”.Charles Parton, a former foreign office official and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “People pushing these sort of lines are doing everybody a disservice.“It will inevitably prompt a Chinese reaction at a time when there is a need for a proper scientific understanding of its causes, and, in the longer term, to work together to stop pandemics happening again.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432cee8c0b180f3871a1126244d66cf6d174448c/0_296_4913_2947/master/4913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=649a1818c5dd0529893b8b9e654dbb4f","title":"german covid 19 cases may be 10 times higher than official figures","story":"Researchers highlight risk of asymptomatic infection, as Europe begins easing lockdownMore than 10 times as many people in Germany as thought may have been infected with coronavirus, researchers have said, as Italy led swathes of Europe out of lockdown and officials said the continent’s outbreak was mostly past its peak.Researchers from Bonn University said on Monday that their preliminary study, based on fieldwork in the town of Gangelt in Heinsberg municipality, which had one of Germany’s highest death tolls, showed the risk of infection by asymptomatic carriers.About one in five of those who were infected showed no symptoms, they said, underlining the importance of physical distancing and basic hygiene to keep the disease at bay.“Every supposedly healthy person we encounter can unknowingly carry the virus,” said Martin Exner, the head of the university’s institute for hygiene and public health and a co-author of the study. “We must be aware of this and act accordingly.”Research in France, where a Paris-area hospital has retested old samples from pneumonia patients, has found a Covid-19 case from 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases, and suggesting the virus was circulating in Europe earlier than previously thought.Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in the northern suburbs of Paris, said the man, who had not made any trips, was sick for 15 days and had infected his two children, but not his wife. “He was amazed. He didn’t understand how he had been infected,” he said. As millions of people in Italy and across the continent went back to work, the EU’s agency for disease control said only five European countries were not yet showing a clear downward trend in their outbreaks.Second only to the US in its Covid-19 death tally of nearly 29,000, Italy sent more than 4 million construction and factory workers back to their jobs after reporting its lowest toll since the government imposed a national lockdown on 9 March.After nine weeks of confinement, the country’s 60 million residents were finally free to stroll in streets and parks and to visit relatives. Restaurants reopened for takeaway orders, but bars will remain shut and masks are obligatory in public spaces indoors.Spain, with continental Europe’s second highest death toll, also began cautiously easing its way out of 48 days of lockdown, with Spaniards allowed out to exercise for the first time on Saturday but with face masks mandatory on public transport.Portugal allowed small shops, hair salons and car dealers to resume business, with masks to be worn in stores and on public transport, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary partially reopened public spaces and selected businesses.In Germany, museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos also reopened their doors, while Austria sent senior high school students back to class to prepare for this month’s graduation exams. Some Belgian office workers returned to work on Monday.“It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,” Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European parliament.Ammon said that of the 31 European countries the agency monitors, only Bulgaria was still recording an increase in cases, while Poland, Romania, Sweden and Britain – which has recorded Europe’s highest rise in so-called “excess deaths” above the five-year average – had seen “no substantial changes in the last 14 days”.Russia, which the agency does not study, is rapidly becoming Europe’s blackspot, with officials in Moscow urging residents to stay at home in an effort to contain the growing daily tally of new cases. “The threat is apparently on the rise,” the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, told citizens.Russia registered a near-record in new daily cases on Monday as the number of total infections exceeded 145,000, cementing the country’s position as the top reporter of new cases in Europe. Health officials reported 10,581 new infections over the last 24 hours, only 52 less than Sunday’s record. The country has so far recorded 145,268 cases and 1,356 deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcccc157ccea069755c1c3d5edd9901778ba7340/0_1238_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be4ec65a13055af6370f3ffa7dddc851","title":"guinea pigs isle of wight residents mixed reactions to contact tracing app coronavirus","story":"Coronavirus app being trialled on island as part of plans to prevent second outbreakIsle of Wight residents have complained they have been “left in the dark” about trials of a pilot NHS coronavirus contact tracing app on the island as part of UK government plans to prevent a second wave of infections.The plans have nonetheless been welcomed in principle, although people are concerned that the app, which uses bluetooth technology to register contact between users when they come within about 2 metres of each other for at least 15 minutes, would only be truly effective after the lockdown has been eased.“It is important that we learn from other countries like Germany and South Korea which adopted a test, track and trace approach. Having a pilot on an island makes sense and, as we have a relatively low number of cases, it could be a safe place to do it. It will be the only way to get out of the lockdown which is causing many a great deal of economic hardship, isolation and stress.”“I am supportive of trialling the technology but not if it requires the early lifting of lockdown or social distancing, which I’m assured it will not.

Today I feel liberated, but with caution – that’s the important thing, we can have the freedom but we must be really careful.”An estimated 4 million people returned to work on Monday as part of what the Italian government called the second phase of the country’s coronavirus emergency, with the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealing to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to “act responsibly”.The easing of restrictions is gradual, with factories geared towards exports and construction sites allowed to resume activity immediately. Bars and restaurants can offer takeaway services but will not fully reopen until 1 June. Retailers, museums and libraries will open from 18 May, hairdressers and gyms from 1 June and schools from September.Usually buzzing with activity in the morning, people wearing face masks queued outside bars in Orvieto as they waited for their espresso. “This is a great step even if we have to remain cautious – it gives you something else to smile about,” said Slavik Cebanu.Jaskaran Singh, who works in Caffè Barrique, said: “We are happy to be able to open even if things are still restricted, and to see some movement. I just hope everything goes well.”Although the infection rate has been steadily falling, fear of the virus lingers. The vast majority of daily new cases are being registered in the northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. No new cases have been recorded in Umbria for the past few days.“Certainly, the fact that there are zero cases is important for us, but at the same time it doesn’t mean we’re fully secure as the virus is still there,” said Valentina Santanicchio, a chef whose restaurant in Orvieto, Capitano del Popolo, has been providing home deliveries. “In some ways, I’m more afraid than when we closed, as a lot will now depend on people managing the moment in a responsible way.”Maintaining physical distancing will be crucial to ensuring Covid-19, which has claimed almost 29,000 lives in Italy, is kept at bay. People can now visit relatives and partners within their regions and go for a walk or exercise in a park, but most civil liberties remain curtailed. Travelling between regions is still banned, unless it is for a valid reason.Walter Ricciardi, the scientist advising the health ministry on its coronavirus measures, said the country would go straight back into lockdown if the infection rate rose again. “We’re still in a risky phase,” he told La Repubblica. “It will take two weeks to see how it’s going.”In Lazio, the region surrounding Rome, 53 new cases were recorded on Sunday. “Slowly, I feel optimistic, but let’s just hope we don’t go crazy and start peaking again,” said Marsha De Salvatore, an English teacher and founder of Rome’s Comedy Club.De Salvatore has thalassemia, a blood disorder that requires transfusions every two to three weeks. “I’ll take walks as far as possible but for the rest, things will mostly stay the same,” she said. “The one thing I can’t wait to do, once more restrictions are lifted, is have a coffee in a bar.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e27edda18a46ad3c7f5c3597aee15307d02c76/0_207_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024262629a6677fb63f441c321a6d36c","title":"north korean defectors sorry after false kim jong un speculation","story":"Thae Yong-ho and Ji Seong-ho both said in South Korea that leader was gravely ill or deadA former senior North Korean diplomat has apologised after saying Kim Jong-un was probably so ill he could not stand, days before he emerged on state media smoking and walking briskly at an event attended by hundreds of officials.Kim disappeared from state media for three weeks, an unusually long time, leading to concerns over the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.High-profile defectors from the country speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead. North Korean media on Saturday broadcast video of Kim during a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.One of the defectors, Thae Yong-ho, former deputy ambassador to Britain and one of two defectors elected to the South Korean parliament last month, on Monday issued an apology for his claims.“I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues,” he said in a statement. “I feel the blame and heavy responsibility.““Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.““I have pondered on myself for the past few days, and felt the weight of the position that I’m in,” Ji said in a statement. “As a public figure, I will behave carefully going forward.“Ji had told Reuters on Friday he had received information about Kim’s death from a source he could not disclose.South Korea’s ruling Democratic party criticised the pair for carelessness. One party member urged them to be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees, while another said the defectors contributed little to South Korean society.Ji’s party acknowledged he had made “rash, careless” remarks but criticised the ruling party for undermining the two and “instigating hatred” towards them.The blunders highlight the difficulty of getting reliable information on North Korea. The secretive country has for decades kept tight control on information, and news on the health and whereabouts of its leader are shared with only a handful of most trusted aides.Thae wrote in his memoir that when former leader Kim Jong-il died in 2011, even the foreign minister did not know until ministry staff were called to watch a state media announcement.The South Korea government, which gathers intelligence from various sources, had urged caution on speculation about Kim’s health and said it saw no sign anything serious had happened.Daily NK, a Seoul-based news outlet with sources inside North Korea, had reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03f2e73d0093940f12dd1c27f37d26c17bf6bcad/0_126_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a027f79d564583ef474bf3e56d2e65d4","title":"phe to review how ethnicity affects vulnerability to coronavirus","story":"Deprivation, age, gender and obesity will also feature in review of thousands of health records A review will analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people’s vulnerability to coronavirus, health leaders have said.Public Health England (PHE) said thousands of health records of people who have had Covid-19 will be examined to establish more “robust” data on what can have an impact on the number of cases and health outcomes for different groups within the population.The review aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could impact on how people are affected by coronavirus, PHE added.The review is intended to provide “insight” into emerging evidence the virus is having a disproportionate effect on different groups.It follows reports that deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high. Speaking at Monday’s daily Downing Street press briefing, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially among care workers and those in the NHS.”England’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam – who said people would have noticed he was from an “ethnic minority group” – added that the issue was being taken “incredibly seriously”.“We will get to the bottom of this however long it takes us,” he said.The findings of the PHE-led review will be published at the end of the month.PHE said available data on health outcomes for NHS staff will also be analysed to better understand how the virus affects frontline workers.The review will also look at vulnerable groups such as people who are homeless and rough sleeping, it added.It will be led by Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE public health director for London, who said: “Detailed and careful work is being done so that we can better understand this and explore the possible reasons for any disparities.“Increasing evidence and concern around the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic groups highlights an important focus of this review.“PHE is rapidly building robust data and undertaking detailed analysis to develop our understanding of the impact of this novel coronavirus on different groups which can inform actions to mitigate the risks it presents.”The review will also match laboratory records of coronavirus cases to existing health records to compile accurate data such as ethnicity and describe the association with Covid-19 cases, alongside other factors such as sex, age and geographical location, PHE said.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it was “extremely concerned” about the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME health and care workers.Its chief executive, Dame Donna Kinnair, said: “All healthcare workers need to be safe right now, and that means that all employees must risk assess BAME employees, including ensuring provision of the right PPE for everyone who needs it.“We will continue to call for accurate reporting of the numbers of deaths and infections among BAME healthcare staff across the UK so that swift action can be taken by employers to reduce risk and harm. But we cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b46504dd5c365186fd3f3b935689ef8f24701fe4/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b4596e25fd715e6917da6643e2fe3fa","title":"scientists disagree over face masks effect on covid 19","story":"Experts clash over research into efficacy of public wearing even homemade face coveringsA row has erupted among scientists over a new report into the use of face masks by the general public as an approach to managing the spread of Covid-19 in the community.The report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve – Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics – has weighed up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing face masks, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle Covid-19.“Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers,” the report notes. “If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission.”The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to prohibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing requiredThe conclusion is based on analysis of three key considerations, including the role of droplets as a route of transmission, and whether masks can help to reduce dispersal of droplets. However the authors note there are only a small number of studies.But the report prompted other scientists to express their reservations, warning that it amounted to no more than opinion and overstated the available evidence.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the report “falls short of delivering new evidence and too casually dismisses precautionary principle when addressing the possibility that masks and coverings could have negative effects on people’s behaviours”.He added: “Until more evidence is delivered in either direction, that’s all advice can be based on – opinions.”Dr Ben Killingley, consultant in acute medicine and infectious diseases at University College London hospital, was also critical.“The report is overly optimistic about the value of face coverings and it is incorrect to conclude that the evidence shows that face covering can reduce viral transmission in the community,” he said. “There is in fact no good evidence that face coverings achieve this.”Killingley added that the report largely ignored real-world data, which suggests low effectiveness, albeit for protection of the wearer.“This is not to say that face coverings might not be helpful,” he said, noting, face mask studies have not been carried out during a pandemic or in the context of a novel virus. “Nevertheless, the report, in my view, does not accurately represent the evidence on face coverings that currently exists,” he said.Dr Antonio Lazzarino of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, agreed.“That is not a piece or research. That is a non-systematic review of anecdotical and non-clinical studies,” he said.“The evidence we need before we implement public interventions involving billions of people, must come ideally from randomised controlled trials at population level or at least from observational follow-up studies with comparison groups,” said Lazzarino noting that will allow experts to look at the pros and cons of wearing masks.“Based on what we now know about the dynamics of transmission and the pathophysiology of Covid-19, the negative effects of wearing masks outweigh the positive,” he said.But Prof Trisha Greenhalgh, of the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, welcomed the report, saying it adds weight to the argument that face coverings by the general public could be part of a route out of lockdown.“It draws together a wealth of evidence including the science of transmission and the efficacy of cloth-based materials both in laboratory studies and in randomised controlled trials, in relation to both source control and protection of the wearer,” she said.Greenhalgh noted that while there have been concerns that use of masks by the public could reduce supply of medical-grade masks for healthcare workers, a homemade mask is sufficient for most people. “Medical-grade masks are not needed outside of healthcare settings. A cloth mask provides very good protection, and is more comfortable to wear,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc5afba4fa9c0c1989e992172a6ffa09985d44c6/0_422_1997_1198/master/1997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ade6db87bc62f44c1d0cb6b13d6d482a","title":"slow moving commons debates the key issues of march","story":"Something called the coronavirus had become a pandemic, a minister told MPsJust as Matt Hancock was explaining at the Downing Street press conference how he hoped his test, track and trace app might work to ease the lockdown, parliament was finally getting the opportunity to debate the coronavirus regulations the government had put in place back in March. Though debate might be putting it a little strongly. The tech in the new virtual Commons isn’t up to allowing any interventions, so what we actually got was each MP making an uninterrupted five-minute speech.The junior health minister Edward Argar appeared slightly bewildered by the need for even an ersatz debate. And you could rather see his point. The real key date here is this Thursday, when the government is obliged to say whether it plans to maintain the emergency powers or introduce some form of relaxation, so being asked to justify the current regime that had been in place for six weeks and might change in a few days’ time felt a wee bit pointless.But futility has never been a stumbling block for the Commons in the past and Argar was determined that it should not be now. If there were protocols to be observed then he was the man for the job. So he mumbled on for 10 minutes telling everyone exactly what they already knew.Something called the coronavirus had become a pandemic, he said, and the government had been forced to introduce a whole load of civil liberty restrictions to protect the nation’s health. And though ministers were determined that lockdown would end at the earliest opportunity, he didn’t want to pre-empt anything the prime minister might say later in the week. Largely because not even Boris Johnson is entirely sure what Boris Johnson is going to do next. It turns out that following the science can be quite confusing. Not to say expensive.Replying for Labour, the shadow junior health minister Justin Madders didn’t have a great deal to add. He had no problems with any of the measures the government had put in place, he just wished the opposition had been allowed to agree with what had been done rather earlier in the game.He also pleaded that when the prime minister did say something new, either on Thursday or Sunday – it appears that one of the new regulations is for the 21-day limit on emergency powers is to be contingent on Boris’s own interpretation of three weeks – that Labour would be given an opportunity to scrutinise it before it became law. Argar just shrugged and smiled. Even he’s not being kept in the loops, so there was sod all chance of anyone on the opposition benches being given a say.Not that they all expressed that sentiment quite so bluntly. Graham Brady merely suggested that maybe some people had just been a little too willing to stay at home rather than go to work – so fortunate that Sir Graham doesn’t work in a call centre where social distancing isn’t rigorously enforced – and that old people should be allowed to decide on what level of risk they were prepared to accept. He hasn’t quite grasped the fact that an old person on a midnight flit might actually infect someone else.Steve Baker, whose hair is growing upwards at such an alarming rate he now resembles Marge Simpson, was mostly concerned that the police should be given the correct guidance on how to enforce any regulations. In particular, he was disturbed that some forces had been arresting people for not sweating sufficiently when they were out on their bicycles. What we needed in any new guidance, he said, was a form of Highway Code. There were some rules that must be observed and some that only should. That did rather presuppose the government had a clue what rules it was going to impose. Let alone how to categorise them.For full-on libertarian psycho, we had to wait for Marcus Fysh. He’d rather die a free man in his grave, than live like a puppet or a slave. Under no circumstances should health be allowed to trump liberty. And from what he’d heard, Matt Hancock’s “test, track and trace” app was a non-starter, because it relied on centralised data. So it should be dumped before it had been given a chance. And it was no coincidence that the coronavirus had started in China, one of the world’s largest surveillance states. So there. Being afraid is not normal, he said. Except it is. What’s not normal is being Marcus Fysh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff4d557c7b1da0859bd63fe36ef4320dbe89ec5/0_259_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b50fcaca2f2a7ef4e1ba006c0e74d7fb","title":"venezuela jordan goudreau raid maduro","story":"Jordan Goudreau, who was linked to plot to topple Maduro, said his troops are still in action as government said it foiled ‘invasion’A former US special forces soldier linked to a murky and apparently bungled attempt to topple Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, has insisted his troops are still in action after launching “a daring amphibious raid” into the country.In a video released late on Sunday – hours after Maduro’s government claimed it had foiled a United States-backed sea “invasion” near Venezuela’s main international airport – Jordan Goudreau claimed the battle was not over.“Our men are continuing to fight right now,” claimed the 43-year-old American citizen, who was last week linked to what was described as an audacious but half-baked plot to invade Venezuela and remove its leader. “Our units have been activated in the south, west and east of Venezuela.”The former US special forces medic, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, offered no evidence for those claims and it was unclear where the video had been recorded. There were no reports of fighting in the capital, Caracas.But earlier on Sunday Venezuela’s leaders claimed they had frustrated what they called a US-backed assault near the port city of La Guaira, 20 miles north of Caracas, killing eight alleged assailants.Venezuela’s interior minister, Néstor Reverol, claimed a platoon of “terrorist mercenaries” had tried to make landfall using speedboats but been repelled by security forces.“Some were shot down and others detained,” Reverol said in a televised statement, accusing the group of plotting to assassinate the leaders of Venezuela’s “revolutionary government”.Reverol said “a meticulous land, sea and air search” was under way to capture any remaining invaders, vowing: “We will remain in permanent state of alert and resistance.”In a telephone interview with the Washington Post on Sunday night, Goudreau claimed the operation had involved “60 troops”, including two former US special forces members, who had arrived in Venezuela by land and sea.Speaking to the Associated Press on Monday, Goudreau claimed 52 of those fighters – including two US veterans – had infiltrated Venezuelan territory and were “in the first stage of a mission to recruit members of the security forces to join their cause”.“I don’t care about politics,” he said. “I care about my men on the ground right now who are in the most dangerous phase of the operation.”Venezuela’s defense minister, who was last year accused of plotting against Maduro, appeared on state television flanked by armoured vehicles and heavily armed troops clutching assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade.“A group of mercenaries has attempted to trample our sacred soils and has received an emphatic response from our the weapons of our republic,” Vladimir Padrino López said, denouncing what he called a “crass” imperialist incursion. Padrino López said Maduro had ordered troops to scour the country’s Caribbean coastline for accomplices.The commotion comes almost a year to the day after a botched attempt to remove Hugo Chávez’s authoritarian successor from power.On 30 April 2019 opposition leader Juan Guaidó – who dozens of countries, including the US and UK, recognize as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader – sought to spark a pre-dawn military uprising dubbed “Operation Freedom”.But those efforts fizzled and Maduro remains in power, albeit facing massive challenges as a result of Venezuela’s continued social and economic meltdown and now, the Covid-19 crisis, which doctors fear could bring the country’s crippled health system to its knees.Guaidó denied any involvement in the alleged invasion on Monday although Goudreau provided a Miami-based journalist with an eight-page services contract supposedly signed by Guaidó and two political advisers in October for $213m.Sunday’s supposed invasion is the latest chapter in the bizarre and shady tale of an apparently ongoing plot to overthrow Maduro that is being partly led by Goudreau, a sharpshooting, muscle-bound mixed martial arts enthusiast from Florida.In a lengthy report on Goudreau’s travails last week, the Associated Press claimed he had founded a private security company called Silvercorp USA in 2018 and last year decided to capitalize on Donald Trump’s obsession with overthrowing Maduro.The report said Goudreau subsequently came into contact with Clíver Alcalá, a retired Venezuelan army major general who has admitted to plotting against Maduro and handed himself over to US authorities in late March after being indicted in the US on drug trafficking charges.Alcalá reportedly told Goudreau he had three camps of willing combatants waiting near Colombia’s border with Venezuela and the American offered to train them for “a rapid-strike operation” to take out Maduro.Goudreau reportedly boasted of high-level contacts in the Trump administration but the news agency said it had found no evidence of US support for his actions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ee8217d7aeec457a67a0b4b84428ba810de9fca/0_448_6633_3979/master/6633.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d699ddc9ad767f88158571cdca705e2","title":"world leaders pledge 74bn euros to research covid 19 vaccine","story":"EU-hosted talks tout cooperation but is not addressed by India, Russia or USWorld leaders, with the notable exception of Donald Trump, stumped up nearly €7.4bn (£6.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU, pledging the money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably.But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU.A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani.So why are men more vulnerable?“The honest answer is none of us know what’s causing the difference,” said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon.But the US state department released a statement welcoming what it described as “the pledging conference in Europe”, even though the fundraising summit had always been envisaged as a global, rather than strictly European effort.The US also highlighted its “vaccine partnership to prioritise drug candidates and streamline clinical trials”. Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met.The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said any distributed vaccine “won’t belong to anybody”.“Those who invent it of course will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we chose,” he said.So why are men more vulnerable?“The honest answer is none of us know what’s causing the difference,” said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as “a man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month”. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that “defies the usual ways of operating”.He said: “We’ll need a truly global effort – because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus.”Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said “we support the leadership of the World Health Organization”, adding that without the UN body “an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible”.She said that “multilateral cooperation is more important than ever” and the meeting was the start of a global movement “never seen before”.At the parallel “non-aligned movement” summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as “a strategic blunder”.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the €7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around €500m each. Turkey’s contribution will be announced later in the month.The precise value of inidual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed “fantastic momentum” and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.From the €7.5bn initially sought, €4bn is for the development of a vaccine, €2bn for treatments and €1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: “I would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit … both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.”He added: “My guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.”David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: “We have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably.

Photograph:  Robyn Beck  AFPThere is no need to use gloves when shopping or outdoors to protect against Covid-19, the Health Service Executive has advised.Although the use of disposable and other types of gloves has become a common sight during the pandemic, the HSE is recommending against their use.“We do not recommend using gloves while doing your shopping or when you are out and about,” says Prof Martin Cormican, HSE national lead for infection control.“If there are bugs on your gloves those bugs often end up on your hands when you take the gloves off and from there they can very easily end up in your mouth, nose and eyes.“It’s much better to clean your hands regularly and properly.”Even in special settings such as hospitals where gloves are valuable there is still a need to perform hand hygiene when the gloves come off, he points out, and gloves are single-use for single patient care tasks.The World Health Organisation also advises against the routine wearing of gloves to protect against Covid-19. Tuesday is WHO hand hygiene day.Dublin City Council has urged the public to properly dispose of gloves and masks during the lockdown after reports of people dumping them on the ground.Prof Cormican has consistently advocated against the use of face masks for general use. However, the National Public Health Emergency Team is expected to recommend the use of “face coverings” in limited circumstances such as public transport and large retail outlets shortly, as part of a phased loosening of restrictions designed to curb the spread of the virus.The HSE is also advising people to ensure they clean the surfaces of computers, phones and mobiles, even if working from home.In bathrooms, it says the “real danger” for infection is not the toilet but handles and taps.

The limit for exercising from people’s homes is being extended from 2km to 5km, and the recommendation that over-70s “cocoon” at all times is being adjusted to allow for outings with appropriate social distancing.Increased trafficIn a sign of creeping frustration with the lockdown, figures obtained by The  show road traffic increased more than a third over the weekend compared to the Easter bank holiday.There is pressure from some Ministers to accelerate the reopening plan, although Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Minister for Health Simon Harris are cautious about going beyond the advice by public health officials. All say that the phased reopening of commercial and social life will only proceed if the suppression of the virus continues.The  also understands that Ministers have been discussing new travel restrictions for people coming into Ireland once the reopening begins here and in other countries. Officials from the departments of health, transport and justice, as well as from the Attorney General’s office, are understood to be consulting on options.Officials monitor the numbers of travellers coming into the country every day and their reasons for making the journey to Ireland. The numbers are currently extremely low. However, once countries begin to reopen, the numbers are expected to grow quickly and there is concern that incoming travellers could carry the virus into the community.QuarantineThe feasibility of enforcing a 14-day quarantine is likely to be discussed. At present, travellers are asked to confine themselves for 14 days but the only supervision is a follow-up phone call. One proposal likely to be discussed in the coming weeks is that travellers coming into Ireland should be required to stay in a facility – such as an airport hotel – for 14 days, or pending a negative test for the virus, though this is thought to be difficult to manage.

Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan is to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Tuesday morning to begin the process of negotiations that the three men hope will result in a new coalition government.The three leaders are likely to agree a timetable for negotiations to take place over the coming weeks, as well as broad outlines for how the process will work.The move, which follows a vote by the Green parliamentary party on Sunday to enter formal talks, takes place against differing background noise in the Fianna Fáil and Green Party organisations. The membership of all three parties will be ask to approve a final deal, if one is agreed by negotiators in the coming weeks.The Greens’ leader has received fierce criticism on social media following the party’s decision, though there has also been significant support for the measure. And Mr Ryan received a boost on Monday when the deputy leader of the party, Catherine Martin, who voted against entering into talks on coalition, said she accepted the result of the parliamentary party’s vote and would engage “in good faith” with the talks process.Speaking to The , Ms Martin said she would support all efforts to arrive at the best programme for government possible and then make a judgment on whether to support entering into coalition on the basis of the document.Ms Martin and others in the parliamentary party had wanted firm guarantees from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on a number of issues, including committing to a 7 per cent annual reduction in greenhouse gases, before agreeing to enter government negotiations.She argued that further clarifications would help to build support for any deal with the membership of the party, where a two-thirds majority in favour of any deal is needed to enter government.“I think it would have been better to iron out any ambiguities from the outset,” she said.OppositionMeanwhile, the Fianna Fail members of Donegal County Council have written to Mr Martin to express their opposition to any coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens and have called for a national government as the best thing for the country and the party.The chairman of the party’s Donegal councillors, Patrick McGowan, and the group’s whip, Ciarán Brogan, wrote to Mr Martin on behalf of all their colleagues warning that the party would be “destroyed” in the next local elections if it entered government with Fine Gael now.They warned that if a deal with Fine Gael proceeded the party would “lose all credibility completely undermine our republican, historical and established principles which have served Fianna Fáil well since our formation allow Sinn Féin to staunchly establish themselves as the main opposition party and alternative political or establishment force in waiting and cause our party to be destroyed in forthcoming electoral outings, losing many seats, presumably at the 2024 local elections”.The group also said it was opposed to a coalition with the Green Party.“Any move to include the Green Party and their urban-based and climate-centred agenda would further exacerbate the urban-rural ide and create further devastation to rural counties like Donegal,” they said.Senior Fianna Fáil sources acknowledge that there is opposition to a coalition with Fine Gael and the Greens throughout the organisation, but say there is little evidence that it represents a majority view in the party. Dublin Fingal TD Darragh O’Brien pointed out that the party’s councillors in the constituency had voted to back a deal with Fine Gael.Several Oireachtas members who have spoken to The  in recent weeks said they believed a coalition deal would ultimately be accepted by the party organisation, though they said there would undoubtedly be an internal party fight.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"danish grandparents allowed hug grandchildren schools across","story":"Grandparents were given the all-clear to see, hug and even kiss their grandchildren by Denmark’s Health Authority on Monday in new national guidelines for people most at risk from coronavirus. The fresh advice also increased the age of people automatically classified as at risk from 65 to 70 years-old. The new Danish advice was published as countries across Europe begin easing some of the stringent lockdown measures that have changed everyday life on the continent. You can of course give hugs to those closest to you, for example your partner, children and grandchildren, the guidance reads. But avoid handshakes, hugs and kisses on the cheek with anyone apart from those closest to you. The guidelines were changed to better balance the risk of infection with Covid-19 with the long-term dangers to mental and physical health that come with continued isolation, The Local website reported. Of course, we recommend that people who are at increased risk remain aware and still look after themselves,” Camilla Rathcke, who helped revise the government advice, said. “But we also recommend that you try to find a small group of people you can meet, she told the Danish state broadcaster. Fit and healthy people should not isolate themselves just because they fall into a high risk category, such as those with heart and lung disease or reduced immune systems, she said. Ms Rathcke said, “It is neither good nor necessary to isolate yourself in the long term, and that is why we have come up with new recommendations on how to continue living your life, even if you have an illness or a condition that increases your risk.We have seen a tendency for some people to shield themselves almost a bit too much. Perhaps so much that they have become lonely and sad through sitting about at home by themselves. Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to go into lockdown and was the first country outside Asia to begin easing its lockdown measures.It was the first country in Europe to reopen its schools and nurseries. They reopened on April 15 with social distancing measures for children up to the age of 12. Hairdressers and small businesses opened five days later. Last week, the government in Copenhagen said the spread of Covid-19 had not accelerated since the loosening of the restrictions.  The so-called \u0027R rate\u0027, which shows the average number of infections one person with the virus causes, has increased slightly in the past two weeks but remains below 1.0, it said.Coronavirus infection rates had increased from 0.6 to 0.9 since schools reopened. “There is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can\u0027t see that at all, said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus UniversityGovernments around the world want the \u0027R rate\u0027 to be below 1.0 - meaning each infected person transmits the virus to less then one other - before loosening their lockdowns.Denmark’s government will not decide which other restrictions could be lifted until “very close” to May 10, Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, said on Sunday.It is insidious, this disease, and things might look different in a few days,” she said in a television interview.  If you go too fast and become impatient and open up too much, then we risk the infection spreading and us losing the control we have achieved the first time around,” she said. The second phase of easing the Danish lockdown could include reopening shopping centres, cafes and restaurants and schools to pupils above the age of 12. Denmark has recorded 484 deaths from 9,670 confirmed infections since the pandemic. Its close neighbour Sweden, which never closed its schools for the under 16s or entered lockdown, has announced 2,769 from 22,721 cases. Germany plans a partial reopening of its schools this week. First, 11 and 17-year-olds who are set to take their final exams will go back this weekend in parts of Germany, although other regions of the country have set a later return date. France will begin a staggered reopening of schools from May 11, beginning with nurseries and primary schools.At the weekend, Spaniards were allowed to leave their homes to exercise for the first time since March 14. Their schools will not open before September. Parks and gardens have reopened in Italy, the worst hit countries in Europe,  and visits to family and partners are now allowed but schools are expected to stay closed until September. In Belgium, restrictions were slightly eased on Monday but schools are expected to start reopening from May 18. Dutch primary schools will open on May 11 with secondary schools to begin a gradual return from June 2. In Greece, final year students will return from May 11 before all over 13s return the week after.  June 1 has been mooted as a possible return date for primary school pupils. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ten times people may immune coronavirus germany predicted","story":"Ten times more people than previously thought may have already acquired immunity to the coronavirus, according to a groundbreaking study in Germany.Scientists from the University of Bonn on Monday claimed their findings show that 1.8m people across Germany have already been infected with the virus.That is more than ten times as many as have tested positive so far, and would mean more than 1.6m may have been infected and recovered without knowing it.The findings are based on the first comprehensive study of the effects of the virus on a single community in Gangelt, the town at the epicentre of Germany’s first major outbreak.As reported by the , the study’s initial findings last month suggested the fatality rate in Gangelt was much lower than previously thought, at just 0.37 per cent.The study’s authors now believe this is the general fatality rate for the virus and that it can be used to extrapolate the total number of undetected infections from the death toll.“Because our research allows us to determine exactly how many iniduals are infected, we can also determine the percentage of deaths among all those infected with great accuracy,” Prof Hendrik Streeck, the study’s leader, said as he announced the study\u0027s final findings on Monday.“The infection fatality rate is a property of the virus. It can to a degree be applied to all of Germany — corrected for demography, of course.”It is still not clear whether those who recover from the virus have any form of immunity, or how long it may last, Prof Streeck told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.“But we can draw conclusions from the laboratory,” he said. “Trained immune responses can block the virus, and we know in the case of other corona viruses that you can have at least partial immunity.”So far 165,745 have tested positive for the virus in Germany and 6.866 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. That suggests a fatality rate of 4.1 per cent, but most scientists believe there are many more undetected infections.The majority of those who are infected show only mild symptoms, and a fifth show no symptoms at all, the Gangelt study found.“The fact every fifth infection apparently has no noticeable symptoms suggests it is not possible to identify infectious people this way,” said Prof Martin Exner, another of the study’s authors. “Every apparently healthy person we encounter could be unwittingly carrying the virus. We have to keep this in mind and act accordingly.”The Gangelt study has proved controversial in Germany. Rival scientists have questioned its methodology and they were quick to cast doubt on Monday\u0027s findings.Prof Gérard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research pointed to the fact only seven people are known to have died of the virus in Gangelt.“That means one death more or less would make a really significant difference to the study,” he said.The findings come as Germany faces a “week of truth”, with the first reliable data on lifting its lockdown expected within days.Despite widely reported claims of a second wave in Germany — repeated by Dominic Raab in a Number 10 press conference — there is no data on the effects of easing restrictions yet.The shops were allowed to reopen in Germany two weeks ago, but new infections take time to develop and German government scientists assume a lag of 10-14 days before they show up in tests.With a delay in reporting after a holiday weekend, the first reliable figures are expected from Tuesday ahead of talks between Angela Merkel and regional leaders on Wednesday to decide future lockdown measures.Mrs Merkel is under growing pressure from the business community to speed up the reopening of the economy, and several regional governments are threatening to go it alone if there is no national concensus on easing restrictions further.North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous of Germany’s 16 states, says it will reopen nurseries and kindergartens unilaterally if other regions do not agree.Lower Saxony is pushing for restaurants, pubs and beer gardens to be allowed to reopen from next week, and Saxony-Anhalt has already broken ranks, announcing it will allow gatherings of up to five people in public and an end to the ban on visiting relatives in retirement and care homes.“Our companies want and need to know when social and economic life will start again,” Dieter Kempf, the president of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said. “Every week of lockdown is costing the German economy a mid double-digit figure in the billions.”Even after the reopening of shops, the current lockdown is costing every German €60 a day, Prof Jens Südekum, a leading economist claimed.“Lift the lockdown before it is too late!” the German Association of Small and Medium Enterprises said in an open letter to Mrs Merkel at the weekend.The Munich-based Ifo Institute warned on Monday that the German car industry faces the bleakest prospects in its history.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/05/16/milkyway.jpg","title":"alien life form hydrogen atmosphere microorganisms","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Researchers were able to grow microorganisms in an entirely hydrogen atmosphere – indicating the same could be happening elsewhere in the universeAlien life could flourish in many more kinds of environment than we had previously realised, a new study has suggested.In the new research, scientists found that microorganisms could survive and grow in an atmosphere made entirely of hydrogen. That suggests the same could be happening elsewhere in the universe, the researchers indicate, and that alien life could be growing in similar places.Away from Earth, there are many exoplanets that are much bigger than our planet and have large amounts of hydrogen in their atmosphere. Those atmosphere tend to extend more than those that are similar to our atmosphere, meaning they are easier to see through the telescopes we use to scour the universe for alien planets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the past, those detections have been something of a disappointment, since scientists have believed that those worlds with large amounts of hydrogen would be less likely to support life. But research on them has been limited.Now scientists have attempted to address that problem by E.coli and yeast – two fundamentally different forms of life –\u0026nbspin laboratory environments akin to those worlds, on Earth. Doing so would allow the researchers to understand how such basic life forms would flourish on other planets.AI could trick us into thinking we have found aliens, scientists warnThey discovered that both were able to reproduce normally, though slowly, in atmospheres that were made entirely of hydrogen.The growth of E.coli was around two times slower, while the yeast grew about 2.5 orders of magnitute more slowly. That is thought to be a result of the lack of oxygen.Researchers hope that if such microorganisms are growing on other planets, they may one day be detectable from Earth. They tend to produce a huge variety of gases, which could eventually become thick enough on their home planets that we would be able to spot them from across the universe, they suggest.The discovery also shows how experiments in labs on Earth could help illuminate the search for alien life on other planets, they write in the study.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Applications are via a short online form which requests only basic details.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures for approvals dwarf\u0026nbspthose under an existing scheme for emergency loans designed to help small and medium-sized firms get through the coronavirus pandemic.Whats is ‘bounceback’ loan cheme and how do businesses apply?Bank bosses were grilled by MPs on Monday about the slow pace of lending under the government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) which allows lending facilities of up to £5m for firms turning over up to £45m.David Oldfield, chief executive of commercial banking, at Lloyds Banking Group, admitted: “We had a slow start ... it did take us some time to build momentum ... each day that goes by we are managing to get more loans out to customers.”Banks have blamed the design of CBILS, which leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent of any losses from bad loans. Given the tens of billions of pounds set to be handed to firms under the scheme, those losses could be significant.Another hurdle has been the requirement for banks to assess if companies are “viable” before lending under CBILS. Many companies have not been able to pass the requirement because the economic outlook is so uncertain and some have seen their revenues collapse due to the lockdown.Bounce-back loans, announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak last week, to respond to demands for the smallest firms, significantly cut down on red tape, with companies reporting on Monday that they had completed the application process within minutes.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like many other nations, we have\u0026nbspseen share prices tumble, unemployment claims rise and businesses shut up shop – in some cases permanently – as a result of social distancing restrictionsHowever the technical, commonly-accepted definition of a recession is a contraction\u0026nbspin gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters.In other words, the\u0026nbsptotal amount of goods and services produced by the UK would have to fall for a total period of six months.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest quarterly figures available only\u0026nbspcover the three months from October 2019 to December 2019, well before the first case of Covid-19 was reported on 31 January and the beginning of the lockdown in March.That showed UK GDP as remaining\u0026nbspflat, with zero growth from the previous quarter.Figures for the first quarter of 2020 (January to March) will not be published until 12 May, with the second quarter to follow three months after that.It means that,\u0026nbspunless the previous quarterly figures are revised, we may\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbspknow for sure if the UK is\u0026nbspin recession until August.How bad will the recession be?The Treasury’s official forecaster,\u0026nbspthe Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted the UK GDP could fall by a staggering 35 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 (between April and June).That would make it\u0026nbspthe worst slump in over 300 years – since the Great Frost of 1709, when temperatures plummeted to -10C.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe OBR also expects unemployment to rise\u0026nbspby more than 2 million to 10 per cent and the government deficit to soar to\u0026nbsp£273bn in 2020-21, or 14 per cent of GDP.Over the course of the whole year, the OBR predicts a 12.8 per cent contraction in GDP.However the\u0026nbspIMF has predicted a 6.5 per cent drop in GDP for the UK in 2020, compared to 6 per cent for the US and 9 per cent for Italy.Both France and Italy are already officially in recession after recording falls in GDP of around 5 per cent for the first quarter of 2020, on top of small decreases in the last quarter of 2019. Spain’s economy also contracted by around 5 per cent in the first quarter.Overall the global economy is expected to shrink by 3 per cent in 2020,\u0026nbspmaking it far worse than the 2008 crisis and the worst since the Great Depression. Of the major nations only China and India are expected to record growths in GDP for 2020.How long will it last?The predictions for the UK\u0026nbspare based on the assumption that the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspwill last three months (until 23 June) and that economic activity will gradually return to normal over the three months after that.What will actually happen remains uncertain. Boris Johnson is facing increasing calls to set out his “exit strategy” to remove restrictions and an announcement is expected early next week.However some restrictions may have to remain in place for much longer and a return to normal life involving pubs, restaurants and football games (for example) looks increasingly unlikely this year.If so, the effects on the UK economy could be even worse than predicted.When will the UK economy recover?Assuming a six-month lockdown effect, the OBR expects\u0026nbspGDP to rebound by 27 per cent in the third\u0026nbspquarter of 2020 (July to September) and 21 per cent in the fourth quarter (October to December).Under this scenario the GDP would return to its pre-virus level by the end of the year.But any recovery depends on the persistence of Covid-19 and the possibility of a “second wave” of infection.“The forceful impact of COVID-19 and the global lockdown has thrust the economy into unknown territory where we could see GDP declining at a record quarterly rate,” said economist\u0026nbspKemar\u0026nbspWhyte, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.“Nonetheless, instant and significant recovery remain a distinct possibility if the spread of the virus comes to halt quickly.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

During their peak, as many as 30 of the meteors can be seen each hour.One of the most remarkable things about the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbspis their speed. They shoot into Earth\u0027s atmosphere at about 150,000mph, and can leave glowing lines across the sky as their glowing debris is left in their wake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe show will be best viewed in the southern hemisphere, since the constellation from which they emerge is higher up in the sky and therefore any meteors are more easily spotted. In the northern hemisphere, they will often seem to skim across the horizon, giving them the name Earthgrazers.As ever, the key to seeing any meteor shower is to go somewhere that is relatively dark so that light pollution will not get in the way of the view. That may be complicated by coronavirus lockdowns and social distancing, and any trips should only be made if they are recommended.First credible evidence emerges of person being killed by meteorTo get a view, look up into the sky and try to hold your gaze there. Over time – after about 30 minutes or so – your eyes should be able to see better in the dark and any meteors will come into view.Meteor showers come when the Earth moves into the debris from comets that have moved around our Solar System. As those leftovers collide with the Earth\u0027s atmopshere, they break up create blazing lights in the sky.Each year, the Earth moves regularly through those chunks of debris. That means that the meteor showers are predictable and come at the same time each year.The debris that create the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbsporiginally came from Halley\u0027s Comet. When it makes its regular trips into the solar system – each orbit takes around 76 years – it leaves behind new debris, and the leftovers from the same comet also lead to the Orionids in October.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the sensor, made by Sony, is the same main sensor found on the on the Pixel 3, 3a, and 4. The selfie-camera, meanwhile, has the same sensor as that on the Pixel 3 and 3a.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Pixel 4a will have portrait mode capabilities\u0026nbsp– which change the depth of field for a blurred background when photographing people – and HDR support.Google is also bringing its astrophotography features to the device for better pictures of starry skies, and dual exposure control which should give users more dexterity\u0026nbspwith the colours in their photos.While the character of the camera is unlikely to change, it\u0027s worth noting that the version reviewed before release will probably not be the one Google finally puts out. It\u0027s likely the search giant will have fine-tuned and tweaked some elements before its available to buy.Google reveals new phone that can take pictures of starsGoogle’s camera technology is not the only new, rumoured, information about its upcoming phone. It’s expected that the budget device will have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 chipset, 6GB of processing power with 64GB of storage (approximately 16,000 songs) and a 3080mAh battery. It’s also likely that the phone will keep its 3.5mm headphone jack, much like the Pixel 3a.Rumours suggest\u0026nbspthat the phone will come with a 5.8-inch OLED display and a full-HD+ (2340 x 1080) resolution. There will likely be a small holepunch notch in the top left of the device for the front-facing camera, but that means the phone will probably not have the Project Soli hand-gesture technology or facial-recognition found on the Pixel 4.It is expected that the device will be launched on Friday 22 May, priced at $399, although it could be delayed by the coronavirus outbreak.

That is a non-systematic review of anecdotical and non-clinical studies,” said Dr Antonio Lazzarino, of University College London’s (UCL) Department of Epidemiology and Public Health.“The evidence we need before we implement public interventions involving billions of people, must come ideally from randomised controlled trials at population level or at least from observational follow-up studies with comparison groups. This will allow us to quantify the positive and negative effects of wearing masks.“Based on what we now know about\u0026nbspCovid-19, Dr Lazzarino\u0026nbspsaid, “the negative effects of wearing masks outweigh the positive”.Dr Ben Killingley of\u0026nbspUCL Hospital said that while\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsp”overly optimistic” report focuses largely on the “mechanistic” data of viral droplet shedding and masks’ filtering efficiency, actual real-world studies of face coverings provide under-whelming results outside of healthcare settings.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It then came to the MacBook Air last month.The introduction of the keyboard into Apple’s smaller Pro laptop means that the old, controversial “butterfly” keyboard is now fully removed from Apple’s line-up.Otherwise, the computer keeps largely the same design at its larger sibling. It keeps the Touch Bar at the top of the keyboard that includes a smaller screen for shortcuts, as well as the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and the aluminium model.But Apple has added a host of new upgrades on the inside, including double the storage of the previous generation, going up to 1TB, and new processors. The company now offers 16GB of memory as standard and up to 32GB, which was not available in any previous generations of 13-inch MacBook.It costs £1,299, though Apple stressed it wil offer cheaper prices to those in education. It is available to order now and will begin arriving to customers later this week.Apple has continued to release products through the coronavirus lockdown, despite its significant impact on its day-to-day operations. Over recent weeks, it has introduced a new\u0026nbspiPhone SE – though rumours suggest that a larger model of the same phone could have been delayed – as well as updates to the MacBook Air and iPad Pro.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has developed rechargeable, lithium-ion battery-storage projects called Tesla PowerPack and Powerwall, which have been used in Wales\u0026nbspand other parts of the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company also built the world’s-largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, which Tesla claims\u0026nbspcan provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes.However, rather than being a direct energy provider, the company could also be using the application to launch its Autobidder service in the UK, which uses machine-learning to give information to other companies so they can better “autonomously monetize battery assets,” according to a company product page.How Tesla revolutionised the electic car marketTesla recently partnered with Octopus in the UK for Tesla car owners who have solar panels or a Powerwall to offer cheaper energy.“Your solar system, Powerwall and EV charging are connected to Tesla’s energy management platform. It is designed to improve the way you use your energy to power your lifestyle and allows any stored by your Powerwall to be exported back to the grid, to benefit both you and the community” the company wrote on an FAQ page.\u0026nbspWhether these activities are part of its application remains to be seen we have reached out to the company for comment.On Friday, Tesla founder Elon Musk deducted $14bn (£11.2bn) from the company\u0027s value after tweeting that the company’s stock was “too high” in a series of tweets where the CEO also said he would be selling almost all of his possessions.Asked whether the tweets had been checked by his lawyers before being posted, Musk said “No”.Musk has also tweeted about the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which he called\u0026nbsp“fascistic”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that is a cost very much worth paying.“Even despite mass furloughing, unemployment is still soaring, with over 2 million new claims for benefits coming though.“This should remind us how badly needed the retention scheme is, but also that we are likely to be living with the legacy of high unemployment that coronavirus has given Britain, long after it has been phased out.”The figures came as pensions minister Therese Coffey said the government had received 1.8 million claims for Universal Credit between 16 March and the end of April.Ms Coffey said that overall, the volume of welfare claims had been six times bigger than pre-coronavirus during that period, and that in one particular week the increase had been tenfold.Additional reporting by agenciesOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A replacement will be announced in due course.”In a damning response to Ms Stone’s investigation, the Commons Committee on Standards said the MP had “used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns’ parliamentary duties”.Boris Johnson says he feared never meeting his newborn son WilfredJohnson’s mindless optimism won’t pull us out of this crisisJobs on line if Johnson gets lockdown exit strategy wrongJohnson’s bluff and bluster will not be enough against StarmerThe committee found that he “persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family’s interests even during the course of the commissioner’s investigation, and … misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the House authorities”.The committee – which includes lay members as well as MPs – took the highly unusual step of recommending a seven-day suspension, which is almost certain to be upheld by the Commons.In a tweet, Mr Burns said: “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. Boris Johnson\u0026nbspwill continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches.”Only scant details are given in today’s report of the financial dispute in which Mr Burns intervened.The standards commissioner said she was approached by the complainant – who is not identified – over a letter on Commons headed notepaper received in February last year.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailIn it, Mr Burns stated that his father had made extensive attempts over a period of years to reach a settlement on a company’s repayment of a loan but was reluctant to take legal proceedings “because of age and family sensitivity”.Urging the company to respond to his father’s demands, he added: “Failure to do so will ensure my involvement to secure the return of the money owed to my father.”And he warned: “I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case (on which I have taken advice from the House authorities).”In a submission to the commissioner’s inquiry, Mr Burns said he believed he was adhering with parliamentary rules in using the notepaper.“My letter was one written by a son which is very concerned at the stress and distress that the complainant’s repeated refusal to engage of the subject has caused to a man in his late 70s. If the charge is being a caring son, I would accept it,” he said.The commissioner found that Mr Burns’ use of Commons notepaper in his correspondence with the complainant appeared “more deliberate than accidental”.The report said: “The Commissioner concludes that Mr Burns should have realised that the words used in his letter would be received as a threat, and on the balance of probabilities she thinks that that was Mr Burns’ intention.The commissioner also revealed that during the course of the inquiry, Mr Burns suggested that it would be “ironic” if the complaint led to the revelation of details of the dispute which the complainant had previously attempted to keep concealed. Ms Stone said this suggestion was not “respectful of the standards system of the House”.Stating that it would be possible for the MP to give an apology without revealing details of the dispute, she added: “Mr Burns’ conduct in this matter does not reflect well on him personally.“However, I think his conduct has a wider impact. It gives fuel to the belief that Members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the House to benefit their own personal interests. That Mr Burns has not acted on his threat to use parliamentary privilege will do little to dispel that belief.”Ms Stone’s report was completed last October but publication was delayed by the general election.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Leeds Green Watch firefighters observe a minute\u0027s silence outside the fire station in Kirkstall Rd, in memory their colleagues that lost their lives in the line of dutyStaff at The Berkeley hotel give food to ambulance workersOne of a small group of anti-lockdown protesters speaks to a police officer as they gather outside New Scotland Yard in Victoria, LondonBonnie the Llama grazes in a field in the Scottish Borders alongside a sign supporting the NHS as the UK continues in lockdownColonel Tom Moore and his daughter Hannah celebrate his 100th birthday, with an RAF flypast provided by a Spitfire and a Hurricane over his home in Marston Moretaine.

I am sorry I did so and regret it.”He added: “My motivation was to try and get the company to engage with my father on a long running dispute. To this day they have not done so and my father is taking court action. This has had a significant negative impact on his health.“At the time I wrote I was under a huge amount of personal stress as I explained to the Commissioner privately.“It has been very distressing to me that I have added to my elderly father’s worries. To be asked every week by him if there is news on the inquiry has been very hard to take.“I profoundly regret involving myself in this in any way and if I could turn the clock back I would not have done it.“A second Tory minister, Greg Hands, was told to apologise after admitting to using free Commons stationery and postage worth a total of around £4,500 to send a newsletter to constituents in his Hammersmith and Fulham seat.The standards committee noted that the international trade minister\u0026nbspinitially agreed to issue an apology, acknowledge he had breached Westminster rules\u0026nbspand pay for the mailshot. However, a few days later he withdrew his offer.The committee noted that his move came shortly after the prime minister called a general election and said that “he may well have been motivated by the desire\u0026nbsp to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during an election campaign”.In a report upholding Ms Stone’s finding that Mr Hands had breached the rules, the committee said he should make a personal statement of apology to the Commons, not only for his breach but also for his “inappropriate conduct” in forcing a delay to the conclusion of his case.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But what we are going to be seeing is different measures for different sections of the population.“This has the potential for undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other. If it’s not handled well risks potential ision between groups, risked perceived inequality and injustice and unfairness which can lead to resentment and anger and people getting alienated.”Prof Allyson Pollock, the director of Newcastle University’s centre for excellence in regulatory science, also claimed during the session that covid-19 has “shone a spotlight on widening inequalities” in Britain, as she criticised the austerity cuts to public services and local authorities.And she described the government’s publication of the daily death toll and testing counts as a “propaganda tool” because the data “is unreliable when reported daily”.Prof Allyson recommended that the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes the statistics either once a week, or once a fortnight, to combat the “inaccurate and incoherent” data sent out to the public.Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It survived, but only narrowly.“The racism and the events leading up to the riots were multi-faceted,” says Park, now aged 40. “The riots were America’s first multi-ethnic riots. Prior to this we were always looking at things from a black-white paradigm.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile the role on the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King in triggering the riots is well known, less widely appreciated was the impact of the shooting dead of a black teenager,\u0026nbspLatasha Harlins, by a Korean-American storekeeper on 16 March, 1991, less than two weeks after video was broadcast of the beating of King.Tensions between the Korean-American and black communities had been worsening for decades, says Park.

She says the racism that prevented African-Americans rising in the corporate sector\u0026nbspalso stopped Korean-Americans. Instead, pressured to pursue the “American dream”, many opened businesses as an alternative, including in a number of traditionally black neighbourhoods. “They come in and they set up their shops and there are cultural differences and there’s miscommunication,” she says.She adds: “They were being basically blamed. And they took the brunt of this blame. And when the LA riots broke out, this was the frustration that was vented towards the Korean community, whose businesses were targeted and torched and burnt down and damaged.”In the violence that ensured after the April 29 court ruling, says Park,\u0026nbsp2,300 businesses owned by Korean-Americans were damaged or destroyed.\u0026nbspOf the estimated $1bn of damage perpetrated, 40 per cent was inflicted on Korean-Americans, who armed themselves and formed self-help groups as the police failed for days to stop the killing and looting.Edward Chang, professor of ethnic studies and founding director of the Young Oak Kim Centre for Korean American studies at the University of California, Riverside, says “Korean-Americans suffered disproportionately high economic losses”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And she looked out the window and she said ‘It’s still there, but it looks like something across the street is burning’.”How the LA riots inspired one student to become a social activistHow The Independent covered the LA riots on this day in historyWhat it was like covering the LA riots of 1992Remembering the moment the Rodney King verdict was delivered Park says the relationship with African-Americans has altered as the demographics of Compton and other neighbourhoods have shifted and become more Latino. Another reason\u0026nbspis that Korean Americans have become more politically active.“Prior to the LA riots, Korean-Americans were not as visible. They were not as politically active. He did not have a voice. But after the riots, we realised we\u0026nbspmust have that voice. And that meant getting involved with politics, coalition building,” she says.“Today if you look at the Korean-American community, we are visible. We are in politics. David Ryu is the fist person of Korean descent\u0026nbspon the LA city council.”Other things, she say, remain unaltered.“When we come to talk about racial strife, has that changed? I would say, in general, no, we have not learned the lessons of racism. Structural racism, institutionalised racism, and all these various things within our communities,” she says.“If you look at our current climate, especially given the pandemic, and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, that gives us all the answers we need. We are just going back to the days of yellow peril, when we viewed Asian-Americans as a threat.\u0026nbspSo has racism changed? No. I think it’s still an issue and we have a long way to go before we can actually fix this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s a lesson we learned in the 92 uprising that is still true and even more critical today.”A number of reports have highlighted how people of colour have been disproportionately infected and killed by the coronavirus, partly because of pre-existing bad health, or because of lack of easy access to healthcare once the virus struck.She also draws a parallel to the large number of people of colour – again hugely disproportionate – who had been incarcerated at the time of the riots. Now, authorities in cities such as Los Angeles are failing to respond quickly to help release into the community those in jail and at high risk of becoming infected.“We started calling on the county to de-incarcerate vulnerable residents who had underlying health conditions or are over 60, who didn’t have serious offences who are really there because they cannot afford to pay bail,” she says.Asked about the structural racism that remains in place in 2020, she says: “It\u0026nbsp troubles me that the structural racism that existed before the 1992 civil unrest and still exists, is alive and well during this pandemic.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When she returned, the National Guard was already on the streets of her home.“It was that experience that resulted in me working as a community organiser, doing social justice work three decades later, right in my community. I am grateful I get to do the work that I do. Yet, I am both troubled and alarmed by what this pandemic and economic downturn will do for families in Los Angeles, for black and brown families in South Los Angeles. I am worried it’s going to take years and decades for us to rebuild.”She says “race and equality” have to be at the centre of any conversations taking place about the response to the virus, and the longer-term recovery.She adds: “The lesson we learned that is that residents have to be engaged, they have to be at the forefront of any decisions that are made by public leaders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Especially when you are dealing with a government like China’s.As viewers of the series Chernobyl know, non-democratic governments have a history of covering up their errors.In that case, the Soviets did everything they could to stop the world learning about the meltdown at their nuclear reactor.Today the Communist Party of China has done everything it can to hide what happened in Wuhan. Especially the origins of the disease which has shut down the world.Yesterday President Trump broke one of the taboos in all this. Which is needed.The question is: What is the likelihood the coronavirus originated in the exact part of China that has a laboratory looking into just such viruses To date the Chinese authorities have allowed the world to believe in the bat-eating, wet-market theory on the origins of the epidemic.They prefer embarrassment over suspicion.But all along, people have wondered whether something less “accidental” is at play.Now the US President has told reporters he has seen strong evidence that Covid- originated from the laboratory in Wuhan. The President’s remarks change the game.China should be in enough trouble as it is. Evenit was true that the virus is an accident caused by a strange food custom, the Chinese Communist Party has a lot to answer for.Why did it keep the news of the virus to itself for so many weeks  Why did it pretend it is not lethal as we now know it is Or pretend that it was hard to transmit  Why did they refuse to allow in inspectors from the World Health Organisation And why have the WHO now been refused inclusion in China’s own investigation into the origins of Covid- Questions also remain over the WHO’s seeming collusion with China over the crisis.The CCP’s actions would be bad enoughthe virus came from a wet market. But it must know that it is in a whole dferent realm of troublethe virus turns out to have come from its lab.If the CCP knew all along the virus had leaked from there then its cover-up is even more appalling. Because it means they knew exactly what they — and soon the world — were dealing with.But in the absence of trust-worthy information, darker and wilder theories take shape in the shadows. For example, could the virus have come from the Wuhan lab and been released deliberately To those deeply skeptical of the CCP, it’s not hard to believe it might have done that.They are in a trade war with America with a President who was making them lose. Now the CCP has managed to shut down the entire US economy with a virus.The question for the rest of the world will soon be simple: What to do about this There are several steps. The first is to try to determine exactly how this virus came about. To have an international  look into every possible cause. With no area of inquiry ruled out.That  should also investigate how the communist regime lied their way through this virus. We need to learn just how they managed to make a local problem into a global one.Then there is the question of what price they should pay. For accidental or not, there is no way that the CCP should be allowed to get away with this.Goodness knows they have tried. Throughout this crisis there have been a set of PR gestures by the Chinese authorities.The government and government-linked firms such as Huawei have made a big show of donating masks and other equipment.It is dismal. Like watching somebody who has just burned down your house offering you a watering can.Last month, German newspaper Bild infuriated China by suggesting Beijing should pay reparations for the coronavirus pandemic.It printed an “invoice’ for nearly billion eurosleading the Chinese embassy in Berlin to accuse the paper of stirring up prejudice.But once the engine of the other global economies — including ours — roars back into motion, we must make China pay.We must re-think our relationship with them. We should recognise the country is not just a competitor but a liability.We must punish them for the large-scale theft of information from British and American businesses it has engaged in for years.We must do whatever we can to disrupt their “belt-and-road” empire-building, which the CCP has worked its way into, and “bought up” small and poor countries.But it is not only such countries that are at the mercy of China and its President Xi Jinping. We may be in Britain too.Before this Wuhan disaster kicked off, our Government approved Huawei to provide part of our G capability.All of our allies warned against this. Our intelligence-sharing partners in the Five Eyes networkall strongly warned the British Government against allowing a firm that is indistinguishable from the CCP from having such access.Experience shows Chinese firms cannot be trusted to provide such sensitive — and strategic — technology.The Huawei decision was a rare misstep by the Johnson government. Now is the time to correct it.We do not need to provoke China. But nor do we need to pander to it. And we should not be putting our future security in their hands.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Living by the sea, in paradise, with a triangular- torsoed Hollywood hunk.But thenyou take a glance at your social media, you’ll notice that absolutely everyone  is living the Hemsworth dream.It’s an endless parade of people’s perfect sourdough baking and of jolly board games with the kids.This morning, my Instagram feed featured a young family doing a fancy dress dinner, a girl on an enormous horse, a woman sprawled on the bonnet of a Mercedes SL, a man with a cute dog, doing exercises, and a shot of some cows taken through a wisteria bush.On Instagram, no one is ever bored, it never rains and everyone’s breasts are perfect. Especially Chris Hemsworth’s.This is having an effect on the nation’s teenagers. They have been told there will be no exams this year and that all their school work was for nothing. They’ve been told they have to stay indoors and that they can’t see their friends.And it’s driving them mad because they do not read newspapers. They do not listen to the BBC news. And they replaced Radio  with Spoty five years ago.This means they never hear any actual news. So they don’t know what’s going on.Instead they look at their phonesand all they can see are pretty girls with swimsuits up their a*** cheeks, and Chris Hemsworth, and parents who have turned the cellar into a nightclub and lots of cute ducklings.And they’re thinking, as they watch the rain trickle down the windows at their house: “Why can’t I have some of that ”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

So I’ve come up with another idea . . .If you are an old person stuck in a tower block, waiting for Covid- to stick its warty little head through the letterbox, post a picture of your surroundings on Instagram. Don’t hold back. Show us the overflowing cat litter and the photograph of your husband, alone in his hospital bed.Show us also pictures of your sister who is in a care home and hasn’t had a visitor for five weeks.And your food cupboard which has nothing in it any more. And your empty bottle of Senokot.In fact, we should all get in on the act. Don’t wait for a joyous moment to photograph and share. Send us instead pictures of stuff you didn’t enjoy.The particularly gruesome bit of wax you’ve just pulled out of your left ear. The turd your dog just did on the mat. Your fat other half slobbing out in front of the TV.Your kids throwing Monopoly pieces at one another after a row over Fenchurch Street station.Instead of sharing your perfect loaf, send pictures of the charred wreck that went wrong, the scarf full of dropped stitches, the wonky self-assembly garden furniture that broke the first time you sat on it.Hit us with the reality of lockdown. Admit that it’s one part happiness and nine parts ditch water.And then maybe teenagers will start to understand that le is bookended by the lucky and the not so lucky. At one end you’ve got the Hemsworths. At the other you’ve got a frightened old man in a tenement block in Bermondsey.Maybe then they will understand they are somewhere in the middle, and stop bloody complaining.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There is much debate about what increases your chances of dying from Covid-.Well, I don’t know about you but I’ve addressed the issue by sitting on a sofa for six hours a day, eating slabs of Cadbury’s Fruit  Nut chocolate and getting up only to go to the fridge for another bottle of wine.I guess I’m working on the principle that soon I’ll be so fat, there won’t be room in the house for me and the virus as well.But there is one problem.There are now so many empty bottles sitting by the bins at the bottom of the drive I just know my neighbours will assume I’ve been throwing illegal parties, and call the police.A nurse made headlines this week after moaning about the cramped conditions on a London Tube train at .am.She said she was risking her le at work and pointed out that she shouldn’t have to risk it even more while commuting. Fair point, you might think. But hang on.In the olden days – before March – people may well have been on a Tube train at that time because they were coming home from a club.But these days, nobody on a Tube train at quarter to six in the morning is there for fun. They’re ALL going to work.There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what most of us have been told to do all along. But I do agree that commuting on a cramped Tube is bloody dangerous.So I ask once again for parking restrictions to be lted immediately, as this would allow people to go to work in the blissful self-isolation of their own cars.I WAS told this week, by The Times newspaper no less, that this summer’s must-have accessory is a straw handbag. No it isn’t.As no one’s looking and no one’s going out, this year’s must-have accessory is the pyjama bottom teamed with odd socks.An aerial photograph of Portsmouth taken this week showed that the colour of the sea has turned from the usual mud brown to a shimmering, aquamarine blue.It’s the sort of colour you usually associate with the Caribbean, and it is genuinely amazing.Naturally, green people are saying it happened because the lockdown means less traffic. And they may be right.Or, let me just lob this one in . . .  it happened because the photographer was experimenting with some of the filters on his new phone.My phone’s got so many thatyou gave me long enough, I could take a selfie and make me look like Chris Hemsworth. Or his we. A MINISTER in the South African government an ounced this week that his country has plenty of PPE for front-line health workers and that all patients with Covid- will be given “vibrators”.I think he meant “ventilators”.If he didn’t, well, I guess they’ll die happy.For the past couple of years, farmers have not been allowed to spray their bright yellow oil seed rape with insecticides called neonicotinoids.As a result, a lot of my crop is dead.But on the upside, I’m now seeing more bumble bees than I have in years. And yesterday I saw a tortoiseshell butterfly, the first I’ve found since about .But that said, my eyesight is so bad these days, it could have been an actual tortoise.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

And now he is a father yet again at .I think it’s fair to say that this period will go down in his own personal history as perhaps some of the most memorable few weeks of his le.EVEN the most hardened climate change denier cannot fail to pause for thought at the before and after photos of the Solent.Aerial shots of this part of Britain’s coastline look more like pictures that have been taken in the Caribbean.The water is so blue and so clean that it looks positively tropical. In fact, it’s unrecognisable after just six weeks of lockdown.The images show how the usually murky waters of the UK coastline have been transformed, which must surely be due in part to a reduction in pollution since the coronavirus pandemic stopped leisure traffic on the Solent.But other astonishing photos from all over the world have surfaced recently too.Pollution-free images of landmarks in Delhi and Beijing, which are all too often seen shimmering under a haze of smog, are a real reminder of our role in creating pollution and also in reducing it.Imagineanother silver lining to this terrible pandemic was that we all began to understand the effects of our impact on the environment, and that we took the threat of climate change more seriously – and started to take responsibility for changing our ways.I AM as keen as the next person to regain my freedom, and for things to begin toto normal.But I cannot be the only one who gave a shudder at the thought of being allowed to choose a “bubble” of just ten family members as friends, as was hinted at by some.Can you even imagine the disputes, upsets and hurt feelings that would result all over the landyour chosen bubble had chosen another group to huddle with In fact, that rule would likely cause so much offence that we would only have ten friends left. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I described the findings and asked his guidance.Richard said: The whole area before then was a large hill called Windridge Hill for obvious reasons.This was quarried away to almost high tide level, then the houses when built into the hole with cellars, undercrofts etc.However these early cellars, this one looks to be for coal, were built out not only underneath the pavement but out into the road.The load on the roads would have been much lighter than now.I have seen these places turned into wine cellars, a place to grow mushrooms, andbig enough, a grotto type bathing area..."},{"url":null,"title":"sadiq khan social distancing london public transport","story":"The London Mayor said he is really worried about the impact of easing lockdown restrictions would have on public transport.He said: As it is, we are providing the maximum public transport we can with the staffing levels we have.At the moment we are able to have a safe number of passengers on and social distance is being followed.That means we are taking roughly speaking a sixth - thats % - of the passengers we normally would.Any increase whatsoever of people out and about would lead to us not being able to have passengers safely keeping their social distance.Mr Khans comments come as the capitals new normal will see commuters wearing masks on the Tube and workers and schools would need staggered start times to keep crowding to a minimum.He set out a bleak picture for a post-lockdown London and said that people would only be able to see their loved ones occasionally.But he demanded the public is treated as adults over the governments plans to relieve the Covid- lockdown.Writing in The Evening Standard, Mr Khan said people travelling on public transport are likely to have to wear non-medical face coverings to reduce the risk to others.However, many have accused the London mayor of risking lives by closing some Tube lines and running trains every  to  minutes when it typically runs be every three minutes.An angry commuter wrote today: @MayorofLondon What about supporting Londoners by sorting out your bloody tube trains        Another tweeted: Rush hour, buses packed, tube and DLR  @TfL putting peoples lives at risk with their stripped back transport.

He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done.

Yellow and black tape will tell people where to stand in lts.One-way systems will be the norm in offices and on train s and at bus stops.Face-to-face meetings will only be able to go aheadabsolutely necessary and be time-limited.Employees will even be told not to share stationary such as pens.The message to employers is to allow their staff to work from homethey’re not needed in the workplace.It means home-working will likely become the default for millions of Brits for the foreseeable future.But employers will have to monitor the well-being of staff working from home by keeping in touch to ask about their welfare, physical health and personal security.The Government has told industry groups the new measures will have to be in place for between six and  months.They were told there will be a “gradual winding down” after the winter, The Sun has learnt.It is understood the y timeframe has been influenced by growing fears among the Government’s medical advisers that the coronavirus is seasonal.An industry source said: “If it survives the winter, these measures will have to be in place longer.”But one positive industry bosses are drawing from the new measures is the impact it will have on dampening traditional flu.The draft papers cover seven dferent settings: offices, hotel and restaurants, shops, factories, outdoor workplaces and those who work in vehicles and other people’s homes.Staggered sht times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for ato work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan.Efforts to avoid employees working face-to-face will see them working side by side or facing away from each other, according to the plans leaked to Buzzfeed News.There will be limits on the number of people in stores so Brits will be asked to shop alone to enable shops to be allowed to open and kick-start the economy.The advice for reopening non-essential shops such as clothes stores will be similar to the supermarket rules.Tape setting out two metre distances will have to be put on shop floors, and Brits will need to queue outside.Many shops will go cashless to stop the spread of the virus through money.In cities like London, maintaining the two-metre rule would make it impossible for workplaces to operate anywhere near full capacity.Platforms and bus stops will contain two metre markers to maintain social distancing and one-way systems will be in place.A complex blueprint for schools to open in waves of dferent age groups is being planned.Reopening primary schools is a priority for the Government in order to minimise the threat to early years development and help parentsto work. But Year  pupils will be first backthey are forced to stagger the reopening dates as they are at the most crucial stage of their learning.PM Boris Johnson wants the first schools to reopen on June .Year  and  pupils are expected to be the first wave of secondary schools to open.No firm date has been set for reopening workplaces but The Sun revealed last week that May  has been pencilled in as a target date as long as the Government’s five tests for lting the lockdown measures are met by then.Mr Johnson will publish a “roadmap” strategy on Sunday, detailing exactly how restrictions will be eased in order for Brits to safelyto work.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said measures such as shields, masks and limiting the amount of contact time with colleagues could be alternative approaches taken by employers.But the draft guidance did not contain details about what personal protective equipment staff should wear when theyto work.The Trades Union Congress refused to support the plans as they stand, saying they “fall far short of giving any guarantees to workers about their health and safety”.Ministers confirmed that the Government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.Scotland boss Nicola Sturgeon revealed she shares Boris Johnsons hopes of being able to start easing the coronavirus lockdown towards the end of May.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a big dference between the . million shielded people, known as extremely critically vulnerable, who have been sent a letter advising them to shield for  weeks, vulnerable people with pre-existing health conditions of any age, and healthy over-s.This needs to be made clearer – you cant just have a blanket over-s group. Thats unsustainable. Its not a static group.The minister added: There arent enough supermarket delivery slots to cater for that amount of people.What we are going to see is more self-selection and personal responsibility.People will self-select whether they are vulnerable or not. The over-s are a very sensible group – by and large, they knowthey should be staying indoors or not.Meanwhile Tory Sir Graham Brady said on Monday night: We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragicGovernment threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age.Why dont we just give them the best information and advice and let them limit their risk themselves In the original Government guidance, anyone over , regardless of their state of health, was advised to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.But on May , that was withdrawn and replaced with new advice which listed all over-s as clinically vulnerable.Amid confusion over the guidelines, Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: The clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for  weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over-s.The Department of Health and Social Care confirmed over s are not included in the most at risk group , who have been told to isolate for  weeks.On Monday, the Prime Ministers official spokesman said: Over-s are classed as being in the clinically vulnerable group – they are not necessarily in the clinically extremely vulnerable group, which are those people who are shielding.Therefore the advice to them is to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.Asked whether the over-s would have dferent rules from other sections of the population, the spokesman added: We know that, as you get older, there is a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact. Complications and deaths are more common in the elderly, even those without pre-existing conditions.But as we look forward it is perfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for dferent age bands, and we will continue to be guided by the science.The UK coronavirus death toll hit , on Monday as another  patients died in the lowest rise in more than a month.The last time the UK recorded such a low  hour fatality rate was almost five weeks ago on March  when  deaths were reported.However there is often a drop in Mondays figures due to a lag in reporting over the weekend with Tuesdays number likely to be higher.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her daily press conference the First Minister insisted the infection rate, sometimes described as the R number, is still too high to make “any meaningful change”. She explained: Although weaposre making real and signicant progress, the numbers still being infected by the virus and the all-important R number remain too high right now to make any meaningful change without risking the virus running quickly out of control again. We also know as we see that care home transmission continues to be a very signicant challenge.All things considered, decisions are yet to be formally taken, it is almost very likely that on Thursday I will be asking you to stick with lockdown a bit longer. It comes ahead of a major announcement about the governmentaposs plan for easing lockdown.  On Sunday the Prime Minister is expected to explain  his roadmap for easing restrictions  in an address to the nation. But he is not expected to relax the lockdown immediately - as the timing of his speech makes clear. Under current plans, heaposll give his address three days after the lockdown has to be reviewed by law on May .That suggests Mr Johnson will extend the lockdown for another three weeks this Thursday, perhaps with some minor changes, until the end of May. Only then, after the lockdown has been officially extended, will he begin to officially discuss how it will be lted in future.

Teams around the world are striving to make a coronavirus vaccine - including one at Oxford University which has started trials - in a bid to unlock the crisis. Mr Hancock suggested that the government would not need to make the vaccine compulsory as a high level of demand from the public is expected. When asked about making a vaccine compulsory for children, Mr Hancock said: I think that the extent of the publicaposs reaction to following the lockdown shows that we will be able to achieve very high levels of vaccination without taking that step. Addressing potential opposition from anti-vaxxers, Mr Hancock added: I think there has been no greater demonstration in modern history that vaccines save lives than the need for a vaccine to save lives and to get the world going again following the outbreak of Covid-. And we will only license a vaccine when it is both effective and safe and...and when the independent regulators license a vaccine in this country they will do so knowing that it is safe and everybody should follow that advice.When asked, Mr Hancock said he did not rule out compulsory vaccinations - but added that ministers are anticipating enormous demand for vaccination anyway. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said it is more likely than not that the first vaccines will be licensed for use by adults. Mr Van-Tam pointed out that data shows children are less vulnerable to the virus, saying this will have to be borne in mind. US President Donald Trump previously said he expects a vaccine by the end of the year.  However, experts have repeatedly warned it will take up to  months before one is available.Vaccine trials have been set up around the world, including one in Oxford which involves more than  people. Today, Business secretary Alok Sharma said: Last week, thanks to the UK Governmentaposs financial support of £ million, the Oxford vaccine entered clinical trials in humans. I can update the Housethat, as of today,  people have taken part in that trial. Mr Hancock also announced at todayaposs briefing that the NHSX apostrack and traceapos app will start to be tested on the Isle of Wight from tomorrow. It comes after the UK announced  new coronavirus deaths in care homes, hospitals and the wider community today, down from  yesterday.It is the lowest daily death figure since the end of March. The Government missed its , tests target for the second day in a row yesterday, with , tests.  On Saturday, , tests were handed out despite Health Secretary Matt Hancockaposs aim for , a day. Speaking at todayaposs press conference, Mr Hancock said from tomorrow Isle of Wight NHS staff will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each of the islandaposs , households will receive a letter about the trial and be asked to install the app. In response to missing the target, Downing Street said it had capacity to carry out over , tests a day.

Why is contact tracing so important   The strategy must be in place before Boris Johnsonaposs plan to ease the UK lockdown can happen. To stop a second terrying peak of the virus, health officials must know exactly where it is in the community and how fast it is spreading. With proper contact tracing, anyone who is infectious can quickly be isolated from their friends, family and co-workers. That will mean the aposRapos number - the number of people infected by each Covid- carrier - will stay low. If R is below , the virus spreads slowly in the community. If it is above , it spreads exponentially and can end up doubling every few days. If apostrack and traceapos works, it means society can slowly open up again, with people ing to work and having limited contact with friends in a new normal, while not being overwhelmed by disease.How will the app work  Using Bluetooth Low Energy signals - designed not to drain your battery too fast - the app will log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app. It will then keep an anonymous record of all these logs securely on a useraposs phone. If someone develops symptoms of Covid-, they can use the app to inform the NHS. That will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs. The app will then advise what action to take, including telling people to self-isolatenecessary. They can use the app to order a home testing kit to be delivered to where they live. When will the app be ready to download  The app and a team of human contact tracers enter trials tomorrow on the Isle of Wight. NHS workers will be asked to download the app first, and letters will go to all , of the islandaposs residents on Thursday asking them to join in. Officials hope the system - including the app - will be ready for use nationwide from mid to late May. That is once it has passed initial teething problems and , contact tracers are in place. This means we know lockdown wonapost be lted until at least mid-May, despite the PM outlining his aposroadmapapos this coming Sunday.  Will it work  We donapost know. The crucial thing willbethe government makes the right calls when easing lockdown. That includes having enough human contact tracers as backup, and some experts have warned , wonapost nearly be enough. But we also need lots of people to download the app - likely % to % of the entire population - for the app to work. Some researchers say up to %. Yet in Singapore, just % or so used an app launched in March. If too few people download it, the virus will slip out of control and infect people undetected because contacts will go unseen. Mr Hancock admitted the app would not be enough on its own - people need to take an active part. He said: “It isn’t just about the technology and people in call centres - it’s also about citizens acting in the right way. “Acting in the right way to download the app, because that protects you, it protects your family and protects the NHS - but also acting in the right way to do contact tracing yourself.” "},{"url":null,"title":"not know coronavirus can caught","story":"NewsWe may not knowcoronavirus can be caught twice for a couple of yearsMatt Hancock - who has already had Covid- - said he still wouldnt be comfortable walking into a crowded roomShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video jonathan-van-tam-says-itll-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics not-know-coronavirus-can-caught-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he wouldnapost be comfortable going into a crowded room, despite already having had Covid-. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said itaposs still unclear whether antibodies given by the disease will protect a patient from catching it again. He said the overwhelming majority of people who had recovered from Covid- were found to have antibodies in their bloodstream. But he said: The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections. And we just havenapost had this disease around ... for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. He added that antibodies produced in response to other human coronaviruses donapost persist necessarily for years and years and years although it was unknown what would happen in the case of Covid-. We will simply have to follow people who have recovered and test them repeatedly until we have an understanding of how antibodies last and how long they protect for. He said multiple studies were underway in the UK, which will follow people who have recovered from the disease for at least a couple of years. Itaposs just one of those where we canapost make the science go any faster than how quickly our bodies go in terms of maintaining the antibodies. Like everybody  in the world we just have to be patient and cautious until we get those answers. Mr Hancock said the government was in discussions with Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche over antibody testing.He revealed that having recovered from coronavirus, he is now taking part in a trial to analyse patientsapos antibodies.But he said he would not yet feel happy being in a crowded room.

The group of a dozen experts were gathered by Sir David King, a former government chief scientic adviser.He assembled the rival boffins to look at how the UK is handling coronavirus over fears that ministeraposs claim to be following the scientic advice, but have failed to share recent the information behind those decisions with the public.Sir Davidaposs group, which held its meeting online, said it has been organised “in response to concerns over the lack of transparency” from SAGE after it emerged that Boris Johnsonaposs top aide Dominic Cummings and another Tory aide had attended a meeting in March. It came as Downing Street published the names of the more than  scientists who sit on SAGE. The list of names showed that around half of the experts come from universities and another half is made up of Government chief scientic advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff.One Google executive, Demis Hassabis, attended in a personal capacity as a data scientist, the company confirmed after people raised questions over the inclusion of a figure from a private company.Mr Cummings is not listed as a member, despite reports he attended meetings and contributed to discussions. Two members of the group did not give permission for their names to be published. The minutes of the groupaposs meetings have not been released, and neither has the most recent advice which No  claims underpins their decisions. The new Independent SAGE group warned that lting lockdown at dferent times across the country could lead to anger and resentment.Officials are considering how coronavirus restrictions could be lted, and later this week Boris Johnson is expected to set out a road map out of the lockdown.They also warned that Britainaposs strategy could be overly reliant on finding a vaccine. Professor Gabriel Scally, who is President of Epidemiology  Public Health Section of the Royal Society of Medicine, told the committee that we needed to prepare for a vaccine that could be several years away. Professor Scally, who advises the Irish government, added: We can hope for the best, but we must plan for the worst-case scenario  and find ways to keep going on that basis and ways to keep our economy and society operational. Professor Susan Michie warned that lting certain restrictions for dferent sections of the economy, areas or age groups risked undermining the collective solidarity that has been so important for trust, for adherence, for helping each other. She added thatspecic groups such as the over-s are asked to stay in lockdown while others are not, the message would have to be much more nuanced. Professor Michie also said the Government must ensure those who are forced to self-isolate, as a result of having contact with someone infected, have financial security.

The tough measures will be imposed in a bid to stop a deadly second wave. Boris Johnson is expected to relax some rules and firms could reduce distancing at workthey get PPE. But TUC boss Frances O’Grady branded the move an “open goal” for rogue bosses to cut corners. While there may light at the end of the tunnel for cooped up Brits, experts warn strict measures will be brought in to avoid a ­deadly second wave of coronavirus. While some restrictions look likely to be eased in the coming weeks, regions could face local lockdownsthere are signs of another outbreak there. As the death rate rose by  to , – the smallest rise since last month – leaked guidance showed the Government is considering relaxing the ­two-metre distance rule for some businesses as they slowly start to get the economy moving. The documents, covering seven key sectors of the economy, recommend companies adopt extra measures such as physical screenskeeping a gap between workers is impossible. But union chiefs warned they could not back the proposals as they fear rogue bosses would not implement the rules properly – putting staff and the wider community at risk. Boris Johnson, seen today arriving at No with a coffee in hand, is expected to reveal the first ­relaxation of some lockdown rules on Sunday, days after the ­three-week review is completed on Thursday. The Government hopes the “test, track and trace” approach – eventually used alongside the new NHS app being trialled on the Isle of Wight – will allow it to take a localised approach.  Soa city such as Manchester, for example, became a virus hotspot after the ­lockdown had been eased, testing could begin on a large scale and contact-tracers deployed. A source said: “If you saw a worrying increases of ­transmission in regions, then you would want to move quickly to try to stop those.” Schools and non-essential shops could be closed, to help drive back down the crucial R transmission rate between people, while the rest of the country continued as normal. Wearing face masks is likely to be the new normal for shoppers still fearing a second wave of the virus. As part of the national easing of restrictions, the PM is expected to say primary schools could reopen for some pupils – most likely Year Six – as early as June .  But other tough ­restrictions will remain until there is a vaccine, with cinemas, pubs and ­theatres likely to stay closed for months. And those who can work from home are expected to be asked to continue. Department of Business officials are drawing up guidance to get people back to work in the coming weeks. Recommendations could include staggering sht times to ease the rush hour, avoiding hot-desking or sharing pens, closing lts and canteens. Bosses are currently advised to keep workers two metres apart wherever possible.  But the guidance states: “It will not always be possible to keep a distance of m. In these circumstances both employers and employees must do everything they can to reduce risk.” Cabinet minister Ben Wallace signalled some firms will be allowed to adopt other measures, even halving the distance to one metreworkers are given screens and protective kit. He said: “You could wear PPE, that could be a possibility, or indeed you could find other ways of doing it, shielding for example.” But unions slammed the guidance – which only asks firms to “consider” the moves – insisting bosses should be forced to adopt them.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Throughout this crisis the TUC has sought to engage constructively with ministers. But we cannot support the Government’s back-to-work plans as they stand. They are an open goal for rogue employers, who will cut corners and put their workers, and the wider community, at risk. “We want new binding rules for employers to publish their risk ­assessment. We want clear ­guidance to set out the minimum standards that employers must meet in order to protect public safety. And we want ministers to outline a new tough approach to enforcement.  Unless the Government ­signicantly strengthens its plans, safe working will not be ­guaranteed. The current proposals fail to provide clear direction to those employers who want to act responsibly.” Labour leader Keir Starmer has called on Mr Johnson to form a “national consensus” on the next phase of the coronavirus response as ministers work on the plans to ease the lockdown. He backed the ­extension of ­measures ahead of talks with the PM this week. Mr Johnson yesterday co-hosted a virtual conference of world leaders aiming to raise more than £.billion to develop a vaccine. But China and the US failed to turn up. No played down their absence insisting the summit was “only the start” of the pledging process.

Jake Brown was doing some work at his newly bought home when he realised that one wall had dferent textures. He inspected further and made an opening big enough to get his head through to take another look. To his shock, Jake discovered there was a huge area underneath his home in Plymouth, Devon, so he opened it up to investigate.Inside the tunnel he discovered items including paint cans and an old newspaper that proved the tunnel had been blocked up for more than  years, the Plymouth Herald reports.And he found evidence on bottles that the tunnel itself was from the early s. Jake said: “While having a lazy coffee standing outside the basement front door of the property I noticed a patch in the wall of a texture dferent to the rest. “I also noted that the patch was the same distance from the coal cellar already exposed, currently used for storage. “Curiosity and a little boredom got the better of me, after which I grabbed a drill and began working pilot viewing holes into the wall.  “Once I had made two holes, one for viewing, one for a torch, I peered through into the dark dusty expanse and realised that it was another cavern of sorts. After realising what was beneath his house, Jake opened the wall up so that he could climb down and walk inside. He added: I proceeded to hammer out a larger opening through which I could get a better idea of the space, andI should carry on making mess. “Upon creating a large enough hole to fit through, I shone a torch into the dark, revealing the larger than expected space before me. “The cavern had a lot of builders waste from another era, so I climbed inside to explore and take a closer look.  He soon realised the area was bigger than he had expected. Jake added: I measured the rough area of the space and observed its structural integrity. “I was pleased to note that the stone arched ceiling was in great condition and the expanse measured a healthy m deep, m high, and m wide. In the area, Jake found piles of building waste and other rubbish, so started digging through it all for clues. “Upon inspection it confirmed that the space had been covered up for many years.  “It had been used as an easy space, to hide the waste from renovating the property’s roof, guttering, doors, and windows many years ago before being covered up. “As I moved deeper into the cavern I began to search for evidence that would tie it to a grouping of years so as I could more accurately determine how long it had been covered up. “In the dark I collected bottles, paint cans, and my golden find was the remains of a newspaper, though was more comparable to mushy silt. After an arduous process of preparing the newspaper in a bath filled with water, Jake was finally able to open a few pages in search of a date. He added: “I laid the items I had collected out in the clear light to identy their age. “The paint cans were extremely degraded but had enough detail to show that the labelling was of a s s era style. “The bottles, after a quick wipe, were etched with detailing common also of the early s. “The biggest reveal was the newspaper, it almost disintegrated upon human touch, so a CSI style method was used to carefully peel back the congealed layers. “I proceeded to run a warm bath and soaked the congealed brown mess in the solution for a period of time, after which tweezers and vibration were used to slowly work shards of the paper free while submerged. “After as many fragments of the paper had been recovered as possible, I photographed while still submerged and removed what was salvageable for drying. “I scanned through the jumbled pieces looking for dates or usable information to determine the era. “There were little hints the style of writing, no colour, picture style, currency and then finally a date! “What was barely readable was the year , this along with the other pieces of evidence fitted, meaning the cellar had been blocked up for over  years. Armed with evidence, Jake contacted a historian friend, Richard Fisher, to ask for his input. Jake added: That evening I excitedly reached out to a local historian, Mr. Richard Fisher. I described the findings and asked his guidance.” Richard said: “The whole area before then was a large hill called aposWindridge Hillapos for obvious reasons. “This was quarried away to almost high tide level, then the houses when built into the hole with cellars, undercrofts etc. "},{"url":null,"title":"britain connects what happened zoom","story":"NewsBritain Connects: What happened when Boris Johnson fan Zoomed Labour supporterWhile Lynda Felton-Scott and Jovan Nepaul might not have much in common on paper, both their lives have been upended by the coronavirus crisis.

Lynda, , is a retired nurse from Batley in Yorkshire, while Jovan is a -year-old politics student from West Bromwich. Yet both of their lives have been upended by the coronavirus. While Lynda’s health problems mean she is shielding at home and receiving food parcels, Jovan has been forced to come home from university and is volunteering in the community. This week, we asked Lynda and Jovan to be the first participants in a ground-breaking new project, Britain Connects – launched today by the Daily Mirror and . A year after we pioneered Britain Talks, which was aimed at getting the UK chatting across the Brexit ide, this is a new virtual version. This time we want to build on the new connections forming across Britain as we face the Covid- pandemic together. “Jovan is a lovely young man,” Lynda says, after the pair connect via Zoom, chatting for almost two hours. “It felt like we really did know each other straight away. I’d love to go out for a cup of tea with him when the lockdown is over. On paper, we seem dferent - we voted dferently in the election - but we share a lot of the same values.” Jovan agrees. “I would have never spoken to someone like Lynda in my normal le,” he says. “We just wouldn’t have met and politically we seem very dferent, but we had a lot in common..”  The Daily Mirror asked the pair to meet up for a virtual chat, as our country reaches a moment of peak isolation. Lynda, new to modern tech ‘whatnot’, chats from the living room of her flat in Batley Carr. Jovan, a digital native, is in his childhood bedroom in the Midlands with his guitar. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them YES IaposM IN Lynda thinks the Prime Minister is doing a reasonable job, “the best of a bad lot” who will “get Brexit done”. Jovan is a Labour supporter who “did everything in my power to stop Boris being elected” and voted Remain. Born  years apart, Lynda’s biggest fear is of catching Covid-, while Jovan worries far more about what comes next for his already-struggling generation.But, as they chat, they discover they both come from NHS families. Jovan’s grandmother came to Britain from Ghana in the s to work in the health service as a midwe. His mum is now a matron at Birmingham City Hospital. “She’s at the hospital right now,” Jovan says, “on the frontline. We’re very proud of her.” Lynda’s dad was a pharmacist from Wallasey, as well as a navigator in the RAF during the war. And it even turns out Lynda, a former theatre and paediatric nurse, was a matron herself too. “I was nursing for  years,” she says. “Twice my letime,” Jovan laughs. “I retired two years ago otherwise I would have been on the frontline myself,” Lynda says. “You know what it’s like, mum’s in there all hours,” Jovan says. “On her day off yesterday she was called out and was there for the whole day.” While Lynda voted Conservative and Jovan is an active member of the Labour Party, both are upset by the lack of PPE for frontline workers. Lynda previously ran a care home and is especially worried for carers. Jovan worries for his mum and her colleagues.  “My mum said one of her staff members had to go in with a motorbike crash helmet because they didn’t have enough PPE,” Jovan says. Lynda nods. “I was screaming at the TV news. I could see what was going to happen and I couldn’t do anything about it.” Jovan says: “I hope this is a  moment where people say there’s been a particular way of doing things that hasn’t really worked… so we need to fund things, we need to treat people with more dignity and respect.” Lynda nods: “Exactly.” For Britain Connects, the Mirror and Express are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team. “The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,” Antonio da Silva says. “This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before. “We will draw on evidence from behavioural science to help make that contact as fruitful as possible and in the process learn more about bridging ides between people.” It turns out Jovan and Lynda share many interests. Born in Liverpool, Lynda talks about nights spent as a student nurse at the famous Cavern Club, watching the Beatles. Jovan plays bass in the Themselves Houseband, as part of a collective that organises arts events in London. “I went to school with Paul McCartney and John Lennon, that’s my only claim to fame…” Lynda says. “I think that’s cooler than anything I could ever say!” Jovan laughs. Jovan is a keen cyclist and is amazed when Lynda produces her exercise bike. “It keeps my legs exercising while I watch the telly,” she says. “I do  pedals a few times a day. That’s more cycling than you today Jovan…” While Lynda is living off hot cross buns and prosecco brought round by a neighbour’s son, Jovan is desperately missing trips to the pub. They say they are both “living like students”, staying up late in front of the TV. They both wish they could get to the hairdresser, and Lynda teases Jovan for hiding his lockdown locks under a back-to-front baseball cap.

The staff there were diligent, compassionate and caring to a fault.When I clapped on that first Thursday I fought back the tears that actually shocked me by welling up as I reflected on what the NHS means to me. It matters. Every doctor, nurse or ancillary worker could be my aunt for whom the patients were a priority and the job meant everything.I’ve been clapping ever since.Now though, I’d rather see action than clap again. I’d rather our everyday heroes were paid proper money than lip service, while those same doctors and nurses are doing their jobs without the equipment they need.With a teacher we, a headteacher sister and a brother-in-law who works in the emergency services, I see first hand the dedication of our key workers. One friend of mine sleeps at the hospital where he works to reduce the coronavirus risk to his family. Yet clapping now has become the thing some people do on auto-pilot. The exhausted Facebook mum shamed by her neighbours for sleeping through it last week is an example of the social pressure that has overtaken a well-meaning act of appreciation.

Bea Levache from Kent, redecorated her homeaposs utility room, the stairs, the office as well as designing a feature wall at a cost of just £. Proud mum Susie Levache, , said the -year-old developed her DIY skills, including using a power drill and a handsaw, and was ‘a natural’ who did a ‘blinding job’. The portrait photographer shared before and after photos on Facebook - to which she received thousands of responses. Susie and Bea’s brother Ted, , also lent a hand, and the family aimed to reuse as much as possible, so only needed to buy a few extra items from eBay for the projects. Writing about the home office transformation, she said: I usually tackle all the DIY projects alone but my -year-old daughter took an interest and actually I figured I had a lot of time on my hands to recty anything she might damage. Turns out after telling her to just go for it - she’s a natural and did a blinding job-with direction she did this herself. She was VERY handy with a handsaw We just used some thin MDF strips, paint and a roll of wallpaper to transform my office. Susie added: I supervised and told her how to use the spirit level and how to measure and cut the MDF strips we had.  She was really nervous to begin with as she was worried that she would mess up. The room was gloomy and hadn’t really been used properly for ages anyway so she had nothing to lose - then there was no stopping her! This gave her the confidence to just go for it and after the first two  she then did the rest alone. Susie watched as Bea successfully marked, leveled, glued, pinned and added a dado rail before filing the room ready for painting. The office ling took just a few hours to do and the following day to paint.  Susie said she had been steadily renovating the family’s s semi-detached house for  months, and decided to use the time at home to give the plans a boost. She homeschools Bea and Ted in the mornings, but after week two of lockdown, the children seemed ‘bored’, so she asked them to help with DIY projects in the afternoon. Susie said they have been as resourceful as possible during lockdown by using things, such as paint, that they already had in the shed and loft. The only purchase they’ve made during pandemic has been kitchen handles. After seeing how the new home office looked, Susie encouraged Bea to decorate the stairs with black ling using the assistance of her brother Ted - totally unsupervised.  She said: Then we used up some old tester pots I had to stencil and hand paint an accent wall in a funky animal print design. She had the patience of a saint for hand painting that job! Then the family moved onto the kitchen utility room makeover which had the floor completed before lockdown but still required a lot of work. Susie said: ‘The room was full of orange pine. I taught Bea how to use the drill and change the drill bits and how to use the little work bench. She filled the existing drawer holes, drilled new holes and put in dferent drawer pulls. They look fantastic! The whole room was then transformed with chalk paintso all of it including the handles came to about £ - we loved the end result.  Bea spent three days redecorating the room. Susie wrote about her achievement on Facebook in a post that was liked nearly , times. She shared: We had a grim aposdumping groundapos utility room to part renovate - I showed her how to use a power drill at the weekend . My daughter customised the fronts of the drawersthen we used leftover paint to repaint the cupboards. We also made little initial blackboard effect plaques from leftover mdf, paint and glue - then aged them for the laundry baskets.  As before,my  year old and I can do this - ANYONE can do this. The duo also used their DIY expertise to transform an old broken rattan table for the family’s dreamy outdoor terrace. Bea used leftover tiles to create a stunning mosaic on the table before placing the original glass on the top to finish. The tiles for the garden table were left over from previous tiling where the family had purchased the amount needed including spares for breakages and luckily, there was none.  Susie said: The table now has pride of place on our terrace. During lockdown, we have taken all the blankets out, sat by the fire and drank hot chocolate in the cosy haven. ‘It’s definitely a makeover we are proud of. It was probably around £somebody wanted to have a go at upcycling. It’s comforting that all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the planning, faffing and upkeep of the terrace garden - that it is enjoyed by everyone. Susie posted her DIY successes online and received hundreds of questions from parents wanting to do the same with their kids so she created an Instagram account dedicated to sharing her tips and decorating secrets.  She added: We have been staggered by the reaction. Some of the posts have had thousands of likes. We’ve also had some great messages from carpenters and builders lending advice which has been terric. Susie added that the family DIY projects havenapost just resulted in an incredible home transformation - it has also helped Bea’s confidence. She said: I was always a creative child and my daughter thought she didn’t have any skills before lockdown, I hope this will give her confidence that it’s all there. She just needed to believe she could do it!  Initially she was quite timid about using the power tools and things, but now she’s so proud of what she’s achieved. Pre-lockdown I would never have thought to include Bea in my work - this period has really shown me that children are far more capable than we may think.

The two sides of the busy motorway, which links Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds, separate just before the farm house comes into view, snaking around the property before merging together again a few miles further on. For decades, urban myths have surrounded the white washed building that makes up Stott Hall Farm and the fields around it. The motorway was built in the s and rumour has it that the farmer it belonged to, Ken Wild, had refused to sell it when plans for the six-lane carriage way were approved. It is believed that planners had to come up with way round the problem and decided to simply build the road round it. Ken had been living there with his we, Beth, and their flock of sheep. But rather than being a rebel who was taking a stand against a huge new motorway, it seems that Ken was nothing of the sort. A documentary, filmed almost  years after the motorway was completed, has revealed the truth about why the farm is in the middle of a motorway.

Filmed in  and released a few years ago by the British Film Institute , Cleggaposs People explains why the road could never have been built on the farm. Journalist Michael Clegg explains: A geological fault beneath the farmhouse meant it was more practical for engineers to leave it rather than blast through and destroy it. Outside the noise is relentless but inside it’s as peaceful and cosy as any farmhouse. Ken and his we Beth had moved into the farmhouse in  and always insisted the motorway didnapost bother them. Although Beth did admit it made cleaning harder as the sheer number of cars speeding by meant it could get very dusty. Heartbreakingly though, the couple did witness a few fatal crashes while they were living on the farm. But the nearest they came to disaster was .am one morning when a ft lorry ended up overturned in their yard. Beth explained: “The driver climbed out through the windscreen. He wasn’t hurt at all. Eleven years ago, Jill Falkingham bought the house along with her husband Phil, and the couple moved in with their son, John-William.  They completely renovated the home, which dates back to , and Jill has always insisted itaposs no dferent to living anywhere . “Traffic is very close,” she told  the Manchester Evening News  . “But it’s always windy here, which takes the pollution away.

But the country has now partially relaxed some restrictions as the county enters aposphase twoapos of its exit from lockdown. More than four million people have now ed to work as the nation attempts to get its economy back on track. Pictures showed trains and other commuter services packed as employees reopened businesses and citizens ed home. The government has said parks can reopen, giving children the chance to run around, while relatives can once again meet up. For the latest updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog. However, friends have been told to keep apart and most shops must stay shut until May . I woke up at . a.m. I was so excited, said Maria Antonietta Galluzzo, a grandmother taking her three-year-old grandson for a walk in Romeaposs Villa Borghese park, the first time they had seen each other in eight weeks.  Gianluca Martucci was one of the few able toto work, pulling up the shutters on a small warehouse in the backstreets of Rome for the first time since March , when the nationwide lockdown came into force. It is good to be back, but the world has totally changed, he said. Although he was happy to be back in business, he was anxious that infections might take hold again as more people mixed.  The government has been very wise so far, but I worry that we might be starting up a little too soon, he said. I donapost knowthe country could survive a second wave.Officials cautioned against moving too swtly as new coronavirus cases passed . million globally and deaths neared a quarter of a million.Italy has the worldaposs second highest toll after the United States. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country was still in the full throes of the pandemic, stressing the so-called phase  of the lockdown must not be seen as a signal that weaposre all free.  The easing of the lockdown has been blighted by a lack of clarity over exactly what activities were allowed from Monday, and even whose houses people will be able to visit. The confusion was only worsened by guidelines issued which quickly became the butt of widespread criticism and mockery on social media. These spelled out that visits to even distant relatives will be allowed, including the children of cousins, or the cousins of spouses, as well as visits to anyone with whom one has a stable bond of affection.  However they did not say whether friendship counted as a stable bond of affection. Conte said that phase two would include more testing to see who has the virus, with  million kits sent to the regions in the next two months.

He told Sky News on Monday morning: Itaposs not the amazing thingyou wear a mask that no oneaposs going to get it but there is obviously this issue about human nature and interactionsyou go on public transport and wear a mask will you feel able to go back to work. At the same time, to anticipate should dferent rules be made around masks weaposre trying to source as many masks as possible as we speak and have been for the last few weeks. Mr Wallace said the public arenapost stupid when asked about hesitancy toto work when the lockdown is eased after weeks of strict stay-at-home messaging. He said: I strongly believe the public arenapost stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media. They took on board the Governmentaposs advice... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the Governmentaposs next stage when we get to it. Iaposm totally confident when it comes to the next step we will all together be able to move forward.  Mr Wallace suggested the two-metre distancing rule could be relaxed to allow people to go back to work. He added: You can look at shielding, you can look at how long you stay near people. The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time. If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less. I think there are options about how we can do it. You can wear PPE, that could be a possibilityyou have to be in close proximity or indeed you could find other ways of doing it.

From garish colour schemes to drab interiors, itaposs clear that people have very ied options on what a home should look like. And it can be part of the fun, decorating your home and ripping out horrendous choices by previous owners.  And now a semi-detached house on the Isle of Harris in the Western Isles, Scotland, has left house hunters baffled and amused after a look inside. The £, three bedroom holiday cottage caused a stir online after being put up for sale on Rightmove. Images available online show the cosy looking house and the descriptions hints at the art deco detail that gives the house much character. A living room overlooking the sea loch on the rural island is filled with cosy details and colourful five foot  either side of the windows. But a second look at the picture hints that something very unexpected is set to come. If you focus on the kitchen, you can see some unusual decoration is about to come. And the next image shows the amazingly unusual decoration youaposd be living with every day.  Personally Iaposd not be able to relax due to always expecting a spoon to land on my head whilst I stir my pasta. And amid lockdown, thereaposs a lot of time spent in the kitchen cooking pasta. The unusual decoration has also crossed over on to the floor, just for extra confusion.  Itaposs fair to say that the artwork has ided people. One woman wrote: Very much enjoying this completely normal decor on the Isle of Harris on Rightmove. Another joked: Thataposs a scene from Inception, right. A third person added: I donapost know what they put in their tea, but spilling it on the floor is obviously not a good idea.  And one person asked the question many people were thinking: Why would anyone do that  They could fall off and land on your head. Another helpfully suggested the estate agents should add: Features nightly redecoration by poltergeists to the property description. One tweet said: Yikes! Do the particulars mention it at all  “Needs cosmetic improvement” “one quirky previous owner” But one fan defended the decoration - pointing out the potential lack of things to do on an isolated Scottish island in the Outer Hebrides. She wrote: Given enough spoons, enough glue, and nothing but sea and sky for alternatives, youaposd do it too, wouldaposncha  Online, the property description states: Kilda House was built by Lord Leverhulme in  as the original Doctors House.  It has been extensively refurbished and insulated to a high standard by the current owners. The inner doors are the original  doors and their art deco details set the style that gives the house its character, much loved by the regular guests. Professional artist Suzan Visser has used three- dimensional ‘trompe d’oeil’ painting techniques throughout on furniture, fireplaces and floors to great effect. On either side of the picture window overlooking the sea loch are a pair of stunning  foot tall ‘Moe¨t et Chandon’  paintings done in the Mucha style by Suzan, which are included with the property. Moving on through the house, many people were also taken by the bespoke beach themed decorated floor in the bathroom.  The sandy interior wasnapost for everyone with one unkind person writing: It looks like it needs a good sweeping. The colourful home doesnapost disappoint as you make your way virtually through the house.As one pun fan wrote on Twitter : It really bowls me over. Not something I would usually anticiplate! The rest of the house features other artistic details such as painted fireplaces and another painted bathroom floor. As one person joked: This is very mid aposs Changing Rooms. I keep expecting Carol Smiley to walk through the door and then one of the homeowners to burst in to tears.

The incident is believed to have happened in Dagenham, East London on Saturday May .

The driver seemingly misjudges the gap and as they accelerate. The Audi caught the side of wide vehicle sending the car spiralling in the air and onto the pavement to exactly where a pedestrian was walking with shopping bags.Fortunately the man had enough time to hear the initial collision, turn around to see the the vehicle heading straight towards him and just enough time to run. The car came to a stop where the man would have been walking.

Stationary sharing will be banned, time-constrained face-to-face meetings only heldabsolutely necessary and one-way systems and screens could all be introduced. As the death rate rose yesterday by  to , – the smallest increase since last month – leaked guidance showed the Government is considering relaxing the ­two-metre distance rule for some businesses as they slowly start to get the economy moving.But the plans outlined in the documents to industry groups, covering seven key sectors of the economy, recommend companies adopt extra measures - will reportedly remain until after the winter.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  An industry insider has told The Sun the new measures will be in place between six and  months, before a gradual winding down early next year due to fears about the virus being seasonal.The source said: “If it survives the winter, these measures will have to be in place longer.” The draft Whitehall documents also propose closing office lts and canteens and putting tape on the floor to mark where people should stand. Extra cleaning should be introduced in office spaces and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining a distance of two metres between workers is not possible. Customer-facing employees could be guarded by plastic screens, while continued home working and staggered shts should also be encouraged, the guidance says. Other measures include communal facilities like photocopier being limited, as well as hand sanitisers on train s and safety guidance for homeworkers, as well as shoppers being urged to buy food alone and taxi drivers using contactless. The proposals by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategyare among a list of guidelines in seven documents drawn up after consultation with executives, trade bodies and unions.  A Government spokesperson said: The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence toto work. Boris Johnson is expected to unveil his roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Sunday, but is not expected to set firm dates. The Prime Minister is, however, likely to confirm the phased reopening of schools alongside the guidelines he has sent businesses and trade unions for how to make workplaces safe for ing staff. The PM has also said the government is looking at relaxing laws restricting supermarket opening hours. Frances OaposGrady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress , said the issue of employee safety should be at the top of the Prime Ministeraposs in-tray. As part of tough new measures to protect workers, the TUC has called for businesses wanting to re-open to first pass risk assessments carried out by unions or health and safety officials. Everyone wants people to get back to work safely so we can get the economy back on its feet, Ms OaposGrady said.

The government has set five tests that need to be met before any restrictions are lted in Britain. The tests are:To make sure the NHS can cope by providing sufficient critical care across the UK To see a sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates with confidence the UK is beyond the peak Reliable data to show the infection rate is falling to manageable levels There is enough testing and personal protective equipmentto meet future demand Any changes in restrictions would not lead to a second peakAnd Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam earlier indicated that two of those tests have now been met. Speaking at todayaposs Downing Street briefing, Professor Van-Tam said: The first test is around NHS capacity and weaposre in a good position on that one. And on the fall in daily deaths, he added: Itaposs now very clear in the data that we are past the peak...itaposs absolutely going in the right direction now. Mondayaposs death toll was the lowest daily figure since March, with  deaths meaning the country now stands at , fatalities from coronavirus.However, Prof Van-Tam remained cautious about any easing of the lockdown. New cases need to come down further...we have to get cases lower, he added, before explaining that more work is needed to be done for Britain to meet the other three tests.  He said: He went on: The [third test] is solid information the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. This is an indicator we need to keep a close eye on over the next few days and weeks. The fourth one is around operational challenges on testing and personal protective equipmentand being able to meet future demand. There are continuing challenges on PPE and itaposs a priority to continue pushing on this. On testing, weaposre in a very good position.  Finally we have to be confident that the adjustments we contemplate are not going to risk a second peak of infections and this is really a matter of deep scientic discussion.

She never dreamed of running her own company or travelling the world. ­Instead she simply saw a family in her future.But after the Government halted IVF treatments due to coronavirus, her hopes of having children began to slip away.“This was possibly our last chance to have a baby – I’m heartbroken because all I want is to be a mum,” says the personal trainer. Victoria, , has a diminished oian reserve, which means she has few eggs left in her oies and she’d pinned her hopes on her fourth cycle of IVF this month. Victoria is one of thousands of women who have been hit by the closure of many IVF clinics in the UK and Europe due to the pandemic. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority ruled all NHS and private clinics must stop IVF treatment by April . Gwenda Burns, chief executive of the charity Fertility Network UK, says: “More than , patients underwent , fertility treatments in . If these numbers are similar for , and we expect them to have increased, then this pandemic is silently affecting the lives of many more people than is immediately obvious.” The tragedy is that many of these women are in their late s and have little time to delay. According to Dr Marco Gaudoin, medical director of the GCRM fertility clinic in Glasgow, the success of fertility treatment is so age dependent that even a short hold-up will impact on women’s eggs. “From the age of  onwards, your odds of IVF working drop by .% a month,” he says.  “So after six months it’s dropped by %. For  year olds, the odds of successful IVF are  per cent, soyou let six months pass, that drop in two per cent leaves you with an eight per cent chance. That’s scary for women in their late s and early s. The fading of her chances haunts Victoria, who has been with her husband Tom, , a concept artist, for  years. “I kept doing ovulation tests, but there was never a positive result,” she says. After nine months of trying without success the couple saw their GP. “Tests showed I have the egg quantities of someone  years older.” Doctors suggested IVF, but the Stockwells had to go private as IVF wasn’t offered on the NHS where they live in Ely, Cambs. Victoria started her first cycle in May  and two more followed. The upcoming fourth round felt like the couple’s last chance. “We don’t have anything left: no embryos in the freezer and, after spending £, on treatment, no money. When the clinics open, my low egg reserve means I don’t think I’m going to be able to try IVF again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman who claims prince andrew","story":"NewsWoman who claims Prince Andrew abused her at  hits back at PR stunt accusationsVirginia Giuffre, , who alleges the Duke of Yorks paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein pimped her out has voiced her fury that the royal is yet to be grilled by officialsShareByChristopher BucktinUnited States Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPrince Andrew\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Queen was believed to have a personal furtune of £million in  with the majority of the British monarchyaposs wealth coming from inherited land and investments. This is in addition to the sovereign grant to pay for the royal familyaposs expenses, which comes from taxpayers. But that wealth pales in comparision to the coffers of the House of Saud, the ruling family in Saudi Arabia. The monarchy is said to worth more than £TRILLION - more than  times the wealth of the British royal family. And with that amount of cash, the royal family expect only the best. Private jets, luxury superyachts, helicopters, palaces, luxury chateaus, gold furniture in their lavish homes - and even a gold-plated tissue dispenser. Among one of the biggest spenders in the royal family is Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. On one wall in one of his Saudi Arabian royal palaces hangs a Leonardo Da Vinci painting worth £million. The crown prince, who is heir to the throne, is also said to have bought a £million superyacht, £million chateau in France, two homes in London and an entire compound on the southern coast of Spain. As deputy prime minister - his father King Salman is Prime Minister - the crown prince is said to be the power behind the throne. Along with his massive spending, he has also made some important cultural changes to Saudi Arabia, including removing the ban on women being able to drive. But with a personal fortune of almost £.billion he can certainly afford to splash the cash. Unlike the British royal family, the Saudi monarchy hasnapost gained its wealth from land - instead their vast fortune comes from the huge oil reserves in the Middle Eastern country. The crown prince also seems to have turned his attention to acquiring a football club and is believed to be heading a consortium who wants to buy Newcastle United. However, he refuses to be drawn on how large his vast wealth actually is.  In an interview with  CBS News, the Crown Prince insisted that his finances were a private matter.He added: I’m a rich person and not a poor person. I’m not Gandhi or Mandela. I’m a member of the ruling family that existed for hundreds of years before the founding of Saudi Arabia. His father the king, who came to throne in , is believed to have a personal fortune of £.billion. One of the wealthiest members of the Saudi royal family is Prince Alwaleed, who was said to have a fortune of £billion and was the th richest man in the world. But then he was arrested under the orders of the crown prince. He was one of the three members of the royal family to be arrested in November  as part of an anti-corruption drive by the government. He was freed a few months later and is believed to have made a financial settlement and fallen out of the Forbes rich lists. However, the prince still owns a huge superyacht which was used in the James Bond film, Never Say Never Again. He also has but a mere two palaces with a third currently being built. The Kingdom Palace is the residence the prince calls his main home. Worth £million the sand-coloured palace boasts  rooms, five kitchens, including one solely for desserts, a lagoon-shaped pool and a -seat cinema. In addition , tonnes of Italian marble were used in the palaceaposs construction and the floors are covered in silk oriental carpets. And thereaposs no chance of the prince ever getting bored when heaposs at home as the palace has  TVs. As well as his lavish palaces, Prince Alwaleed also owns the Kingdon Resort, which has three lakes and huge gardens. His third palace, which will be called Kingdom Oasis, will have its own private zoo. However, despite their lavish spending the Saudi royal family insist they plough billions into charitable projects every year. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal has set up his own charitable organisation, Alwaleed Philanthropies, which he has given billions to. He said: Philanthropy is a personal responsibility, which I embarked upon more than three decades ago and is an intrinsic part of my Islamic faith. And when King Salman came to throne one of his first acts was to donate £billion to ordinary Saudi people.

For me, the club was on its knees.“Not financially or anything like that but morale, the place was at rock bottom.“Everybody was trying to do everything to liven the place up and get us going and get it back to being a happy place for people to come to work.“I think now we are back in a situation where everybody feels part of it. At the minute it is a really good professional environment but there is more we can do to get better.”Despite taking caretaker charge of the final match of the previous season at home to St Mirren, McPake admits his first game as full-time boss at Raith Rovers, a - win in the Betfred Cup, was a big moment.“I was very nervous. It was my first real taste ofmy team – the St Mirren game wasn’t my team,” he said.“This was my first game, our new team’s first game and a lot of new ideas had went into that pre-season.“I was very nervous and probably only settled when the third goal went in.”The Dens boss would go on to miss a home stalemate with Peterhead a week later due to the birth of his daughter.Although it was tough to have to watch from afar, McPake knew he’d left the team in good hands with assistant Jimmy Nicholl and first-team coach Dave Mackay.“I watched the full game from the labour suite,” revealed McPake.“It wasn’t too dficult in the sense that I wasn’t there because, I’ll be honest, family is everything – whether it was a Dundee United game or anything, I was going to be at the birth of my child.“My worry was the baby would arrive when we were up at Coveand I would struggle to be there.“I watched the Peterhead game and I did try to get messages across to the staff, without being too intrusive.“We had picked the team before and for me to be texting from a labour ward and they are seeing the game in real time would’ve been wrong.“The messages I sent were very simple and we had Jimmy Nicholl # he’s played in two World Cups, managed a team that’s won our league and managed a team to a major trophy # and Dave Mackay had managed against teams in that league so we were in capable hands.“We just weren’t good enough on the day, simple as that, and were very flat. That gave us an early indication of what was to come – teams just came, let us have the ball and sit in.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee fc john nelms lifts lid spfl vote u turn","story":"Ever since his deciding ballot ended the lower-league season, John Nelms has been cast, by some, as a sinner in the SPFL vote saga.The Dens Park supremo was front and centre of the crisis that engulfed Scottish football this month after his ‘no’ vote failed to reach the SPFL’s email account and left him with the fate of the game in his hands.Five days later, he switched Dundee’s vote to a ‘yes’, passing the resolution that ended the   campaign in the bottom three isions.Speculation over what sparked Nelms’ change of heart has raged ever since, but the Dundee chief has remained silent.Until today.Finally, in a sit down interview with Tele Sport, Nelms has lted the lid on the events of the last month, and on his hopes for Scottish football’s future – and we are giving his story to you exactly as he gave it to us.George Cran: You stated at the start you were going to vote ‘no’ to the SPFL’s resolution, what were your thoughts on it to begin with John Nelms: From the beginning, I didn’t want anything to go out that would hurt anybody at all. We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":null,"title":"fan reaction spfl vote u turn john nelms","story":"John Nelms says he understands the frustrations of Dundee fans after his voting U-turn saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners # but insists the decision was “for the best of the football club”.And he’s thanked “amazing” supporters who have already spent their hard-earned money on a season ticket for the next campaign despite not knowing when it will start or what it might look like.The Dens Park managing director was at the centre of the voting storm that engulfed Scottish football last month as the Dark Blues’ deciding vote swung from a ‘no’ to a ‘yes’ and allowed the SPFL’s resolution to end the   season in the lower leagues to pass.It also granted rivals United the league title and promotion to the Premiership. After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are things that are way more important now than football butpeople want to dig in their pockets then great,not we’ll see you when we are all back together and have a good product on the park.”"},{"url":null,"title":"youngster on a mission to keep dundee clean with lockdown litter picking efforts","story":"A three-year-old from Douglas has been doing her bit to help out the environment during lockdown.Heidi Anderson has been picking up litter on her daily walks around the Douglas area, in an effort to keep the area looking tidy.Mum Wallis Bain said that Heidi took it upon herself one day to pick up the rubbish # and she now even has her own little unorm from Amazon to help her do the job.She said: #She decided by herself one day.

stage at aberdeens tivoli theatre","story":"She is the star who climbed every mountain to the Sound of Music and played the world’s most famous nanny in Mary Poppins.Yet, long before Dame Julie Andrews was taking the starring role in some of Hollywood’s most unforgettable films, she was introduced to the world, in the company of her parents, at Aberdeen’s Tivoli Theatre during the Second World War.The historic venue, which opened its doors in  as the prelude to becoming one of Scotland’s leading arts arenas in the golden age of the music hall, had already been graced by the likes of comedy stars such as Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin, the latter of whom made an emotionalto the Granite City  years ago.But eventhey provided plenty of slapstick on their way to becoming Hollywood legends, it was the eight-year-old Andrews who demonstrated with remarkable poise in  that a spoonful of sugar definitely helps the medicine go down.In advance of the wartime concert in Aberdeen, the north-east public was offered the chance to enjoy the resonant tenor voice of “Ted Andrews andBarbara – and introducing eight-year-old Julie”.This was in the days before the international success attained by the English singer and actress, who subsequently rose to prominence in Broadway musicals such as My Fair Lady and Camelot, and starred in the premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s written-for-television work, Cinderella, which was watched by an audience of more than  million viewers.But she made an instant impression on her Aberdeen audience, including a young Jack Webster, the former Press and Journal writer, who was entranced by the crystal-clear quality of her voice when the youngster eventually took to the stage.He wrote: “I was very fortunate to witness the very beginning of Julie Andrews.“She was destined to become one of the great musical comedy stars of all time, including being the leading lady in Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and so much .“She sang like a lark in Aberdeen that night and the audience was enthralled.“And her mother played to the same high standard.“You could tell she was going to go on to achieve great things.“There was something special about her, even though she was still at primary school.”The Tivoli might have fallen on hard times by the s, but it enjoyed a reputation as one of the country’s most stylish concert halls with more stars than a planetarium.The theatre was originally launched as Her Majesty’s Opera House by a group of Aberdeen businessmen, who wanted to bring culture to the city.In  or , they decided to buy the piece of land on Guild Street and employed one of the world’s leading theatre architects, Charles Phipps, to construct an auditorium.In , the venue opened with a play called The Lady of Lyons and it flourished from then until  as Her Majesty’s Opera House.However, after being closed while it underwent a substantial refurbishment, the new premises were unveiled in  as the Tivoli Theatre of Varieties.And that was the beginning of a golden period, one where the public eagerly responded to a growing number of high-profile acts, who embarked on the journey north to Aberdeen. vw, px\"  North-east businessman Brian Hendry has been instrumental in resurrecting and transforming the Tivoli for the st century.And he is steeped in the history and heritage of the cherished property on Guild Street.He said: “The Tivoli blossomed from  until , closing only on Sundays.“It often had two or three shows a day and, in its heyday, the seating capacity was ,.“Today, with new safety regulations in place, the theatre now seats .“There is the connection with such famous performers as Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Julie Andrews and W C Fields.“But the biggest box-office draw at the Tivoli was Robert Wilson.“He was a famous Scottish singer – the Rod Stewart of his day. And he came here at a time when there was no television, and most people only heard him performing on the radio.“When people learned that he was to be playing the Tivoli Theatre, they queued down Guild Street onto Bridge Street to see him perform.“Robert Wilson sang to , people, twice a day, six days a week!“The worst time in its history was when it closed down back in .“It then opened briefly as a bingo hall, but fell into disrepair from  until .“Then it was abandoned and, for a while, it was listed as critical on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland.“However, the Tivoli Theatre Company Ltd was formed and bought it in .“Since then, a great deal of work has been undertaken to restore it back to its former glory.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.40197759-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.40197759-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.40197759-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.40197759-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"parking restrictions in place for aberdeen water works","story":"Parking restrictions are set to be put in place while Scottish Water carries out work on a busy Aberdeen street.A temporary prohibition on waiting will be in place on part of King Street in Aberdeen near Roslin Terrace.The Aberdeen City Council measure will run from .pm tomorrow until am the following morning.During the overnight restriction, illegally parked vehicles will be removed.A traffic notice stated: “The effect of the order, which will operate from .pm on May  until am on May , is to impose a temporary prohibition of waiting on the east side of King Street, between its junction with Roslin Terrace and the south boundary of   King Street.“The no-waiting restrictions will be demarcated by the use of no-waiting cones.“Illegally parked vehicles will be removed at the owner’s expense.“The measure is necessary to protect public safety during ironworks renewals.“Any queries regarding this restriction can be directed to AplantLUX on    or Dundee Traffic dundeetraffic@aplant.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/05/5eafaf7c9f2ed4.49240927-936x564.jpg ","title":"renovation of historic north east building on the cards","story":"Plans have been lodged for the extension and refurbishment of a historic north-east building.The B-listed White House in Templars’ Park, Maryculter, was originally built in the s as the manse of Maryculter, until the present one was built in .The building, which is owned by Aberdeen City Scout Council, has undergone many alterations over the years and is currently used as indoor accommodation for youth groups.If approved, plans will see windows and timbers at the White House that have been damaged due to infestation replaced.An extension is also proposed to meet current safety standards, as well as increase the capacity for accommodation and facilities.In planning documents, agent  North Architecture said: “The refurbishment of the original building involves removal of all damaged timber linings and frames, and replacement as close as possible to match the existing.“Where items cannot be replaced such as the staircase, these will be treated for infestation and rot, and repaired where necessary.“The windows have been assessed and where not repairable, these will be replaced with like-for-like examples.“The interior layout on the ground floor will maintain the Baronial Hall as existing, while the lounge and first floor accommodation will be updated to enable safer access and facilities which are more suited to current standards.”It added: “We would encourage the Aberdeenshire Planning to support this refurbishment and extension to The White House, as it will ensure the building is maintained and in used for at least the next  years.“The refurbishment will replace all the existing materials with like-for-like replacements and treat original fittings so they are protected against any further damage.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will

Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"boys-birthday-bagpipe-tunes-bring-smile-kids-faces","story":"Sam Johnston, , of Tweedie Place, North Berwick, has been playing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo on his bagpipes for other young residents in the Walker Homes Glen Ora development.Law Primary School P pupil Sam, who plays for Preston Lodge Pipe Band, is helping children with birthdays celebrate their special day despite lockdown.It started when one mum, Fee Andrews, posted on a neighbourhood Facebook group asking for people to hang out of their windows and sing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo to her son Brodie.Samrsquos mum Fiona suggested that he could play the bagpipes and, after playing for four-year-old Brodie, who described the experience as ldquogood, Sam has been inundated with requests.In keeping with social distancing guidelines, Sam plays the tune by his front door, with neighbours welcome to stand on the pavement and sing along.Fiona said: ldquoHe has been practising in the garden every day, and is doing his lessons online.ldquoHersquos doing something good for his community ndash giving his pipes a blow and doing something nice forthe kids that are stuck inside.ldquoI am really proud of him.

There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation.

Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph.

Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

At first I thought I was the only person feeling this, but then I started to realise many others were too. People I come in contact with kept telling me they felt more busy, not less ndash and Irsquom not just talking about key workers, but a wide demographic in terms of income and occupation. These people, of course, were mostly not those who had been furloughed or lost work. They were also, mostly, people who had kids.Last week, this paper reported that millions of people forced to work from home ldquomay be at risk of burnout as their work-le balance is turned upside down. It may seem hyperbolic for us to talk about feeling burnt out by just the mere challenge of trying to work and home-school our children, but therersquos a pace of le for many of us here thatrsquos undoubtedly unsustainable. Irsquom waking at am to get time to work before home school starts, and Irsquove talked to many others stretching out their days, doing their double shts.We may be moving around less, but many of us are as busy. When our cars, trains, planes and workplaces stopped, tech rushed in ndash Zoom, Microsoft Teams, streamed talks and events ndash and not just for us, but also for our children. On Facebook this week I found myself joining in on a thread, started by a parent with a small business, who complained that she was struggling to get to grips with the confusing system of online school assignments being sent out to her kids.It echoed my own feelings that one of the biggest challenges of the recent weeks had been to try to work out what my eldest son, at secondary school, is expected to do. He wants to manage it himself, but it seems unmanageable. Work arrives on dferent s ndash via email, Teams, website downloads ndash with assignments often not where you expect them to be.Reports into lockdown delivery of online education are revealing a staggering dference between inidual schools, and crucially between the state and private sector. Neil Mackay, writing in this paper last week, reported that a survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association before Easter found that less than half of children were engaging with teachers. He described how one teacher had told him she only had four children out of  join an online lesson. I recognise that. My son was one of three in such a low turn-out class and only because we happened to spot the message when it came in.And I understand why kids arenrsquot engaging. It feels to me asour childrenare being thrown in at the deep end and the swimming skills they have to learn are a form of digital self-management. Some may emerge at the end having learned practices of self-organisation, but many will not. Some, in some houses, have no access to digital learning at all. Irsquom not blaming the inidual teachers, many of whom are locked in a struggle of trying to deliver learning through new technology s, while also possibly juggling their own kids. I also think itrsquos wrong to blame parents. The wider system itself should deliver a lot better for all kids.I also, however, think that children are part of a wider world, and above all we need to be working out right now how to make this better for all of us in the new normal.The truth is Irsquom someone who believes in slowness. I take on board Danny Dorlingrsquos argument that evidence shows we are already going through a period of technological slowdown, economic deceleration and declining growth.But it feels aseven in this pause, le for many of us is only getting more digitally hectic. We could resist that ndash let our kids get bored and drop out at work ndash but most of us are still struggling to earn and the answers to many of our current problems demand work. They also require rethinking whatrsquos important ndash and, what with home school and homework, many of us are too busy for that.Feeling wakeful  The Covid pandemic, a recipe for insomniaVicky Allan is feeling grateful.

The Scottish Government has a deplorable track record in trousering the local government funding it gets from Westminster for its own ends. Over the last  years, Scottish councils have lost seven per cent of their funding despite rising demand. As a result they have drained their reserves, and now find themselves in a nightmarish situation where revenue is noseing with people defaulting on rent and Council Tax just as demand for their services is hitting an all-time high. Unlike charities and businesses, councils cannot furlough their staff but have to bear all the costs of the lockdown themselves.All this means that the people councils serve are not only facing more hardship than ever before but far more than they need to. We see that, for example, in the thousands of businesses who have yet to receive their emergency grants, or the countless children who lack the support and equipment to be able to benefit from home schooling.Councils are the frontline when it comes to helping people through this crisis, and deserve much better treatment from this niggardly Government.Linda Holt , Anstruther.I THINK that Kate Forbes is right to seek proper detailed analyses of local government financial issues before releasing emergency funding. A fund of pound million will not go far.Already you note that Edinburgh and Highland are ldquoclaiming poundmillion between them.I realise that local authorities are doing a good job in these strange times but there are many things that are budgeted for that they are not doing too. I donrsquot think we should reimburse councils for lost income like lower parking charges or leisure centre fees .Letrsquos see the accounts.Allan McDougall, Neilston.THEATRES and concert halls were amongst the first public buildings to close to the public when the lockdown was introduced and we expect to be amongst the last to re-open. Every indication of a timetable for ato a ldquonew normalcy is that we will most likely find ourselves at the end of the phased process and it is equally likely that a large number valued cultural institutions will be have been lost along the way.It is a devastating situation for so many providers of cultural activity in Scotland. However, we have no choice but to accept this situation and we wait to be told under what conditions we may be able to open again so that we can plan to provide performances and events in restricted conditions. Many theatres like the Tron have performances ready to stage this autumn while at the same time we are well aware that the delay to re-opening may be a lot longer.I assume this principle will apply to all such places of public gathering. However, I read today that the Catholic Church in Scotland is drawing up a strategy to re-open buildings and for masses toin the near future . I wish the church good luck in its discussions with the Scottish Government on this issue but I am confused by the rationale. We are all buildings where the public assembles to communally participate in events. If a special dispensation is given then we should be allowed to stage theatre shows in churches after mass has ended ... at least until our own buildings can open again.Andy Arnold, Artistic Director, Tron Theatre, Glasgow.I AM a   live-in carer dedicated to caring for elderly and disabled people.I am employed by an agency currently advertising on national television for staffThis week I phoned the office three times to ask for PPE to be delivered to the address where I am looking after a client with underlying health issues.

What wersquore super excited about is that the gt of light for kids creates really big markets for us with follow on products.ldquoItrsquos no strings attached, wersquore doing this to empower the kids, so they can be safe when they come home from school and get better grades, but mum and dad might say thatrsquos quite a handy light, can you do a bigger one for us, so now wersquore looking at small home solar systems. It could have a signicant impact in helping power off-grid communities with renewables.Like just about every other business, Power a Le is having to cope with the impact of the pandemic. Itrsquos especially frustrating for Warner as the social enterprisersquos strategy of focusing on the BBmarket as opposed to BCndash launched at last yearrsquos Impact Summit ndash had reached escape velocity in sales terms.During , the companyrsquos power banks for mobiles and laptops sold in the thousands rather than hundreds as they broke into the corporate market, which resulted in a corresponding increase in the number of solar lights they can deliver to Zimbabwean schools.But the pandemic has halted air shipments to Africa for the time being, and sales have inevitably been hit. Father of two Warner, though, is optimistic. His business ambition was ignited by the last financial crash when, as a University of Strathclyde trained architect, he went to work building luxury houses in Singapore and south-east Asia.The lsquodream jobrsquo, however, turned somewhat sour when he became disillusioned with his rich clients and the contrast between their lives and those endured by the Bangladeshi migrant workers on site.ldquoThere was certainly a feeling that when the whole world was falling apart around us as the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. I wanted to use the design skills I learnt at Strathclyde to power the poor and not the rich, he explains.Hence the buy-to-give ethos of Power a Le, a model that hits the spot with the younger consumer cohort that includes millennials and Generation Z. Warner also believes the greater sense of community engendered by the pandemic will only further enhance the prospects forsocial enterprises.ldquoWe had already seen an appetite among corporates to do good with their purchasing. I think the virus will really focus the minds of corporate customers who will want to support charities, the NHS or communities further afield through the likes of us.And that can only be good news for eager to learn schoolchildren in Africa. Power a Le has a stated aim to deliver , solar lights to the continent by .ldquoWe had some pretty signicant momentum, a real head of steam before the virus hit, so wersquore still going to do our utmost to get to that number, says Warner, before adding: ldquoLetrsquos say wersquoll aim for the stars to land on the moon.To see the full schedule of Impact Summit keynotes and thevirtual exhibitor marketplace,go to www.impact-summit.org"},{"url":null,"title":"uk-govt-propose-stricter-social-distancing-measures-workplace-get-people-back-work","story":"Leaked draft documents from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy say extra cleaning should be introduced in office spaces and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining a distance of two metres between workers is not possible.For workers who have customer-facing roles, plastic screens should be erected to help protect them, while continued home working and staggered shts should also be encouraged, the guidance says.The proposals are among a list of guidelines in seven documents drawn up after consultation with executives, trade bodies and unions.Workers look set to have their temperatures taken when they arrive for work to seethey have the virus and firms will also be told to lay on more parking spaces so that staff do not have to rely on lts from colleagues.Under the plans, millions of companies will have to draw up a Covid- \"risk assessment\" before allowing staff toto work.The guidance also says social distancing will have to be maintained, whether on the shop floor, in shopping queues, or in communal spaces.A Government spokesman said: \"The Business Secretary[Alok Sharma] continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence toto work.\"Mr Sharma is due to take questions in the Commons this afternoon.The draft guidance comes as Britain enters its seventh week of the lockdown with the Government review due on Thursday although it is thought Boris Johnson will address the nation on Sunday to lay out his plan for the next phase of the lockdown.The Prime Minister is expected to hold telephone talks with Nicola Sturgeon and her Welsh counterpart Mark Drakeford in the next  hours to discuss the strategy for a gradual easing of some of the restrictions.Later today, Mr Johnson in a speech will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the \"most urgent shared endeavour of our letimes\" as he calls on nations to \"pull together\" in response to the pandemic.The PM is expected to tell an online pledging conference this afternoon - co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations - that the sooner states share their expertise, the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.He will say: ldquoTo win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine.ldquoThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high. It is encouraging, however, that Ministers are prepared to keep an open mind over the coming week.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As testing capacity increases, so will testing coverage, and contact tracing will then be carried out for all cases identied in the community.Digital technology will also be utilised in the drive to suppress the virus, including an app which intends to support contact tracing, and support will be available for those who are forced to self-isolate.The paper can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks.

I cannot be relied upon for sensible or relevant debate. That much should be clear by now.Yes Laurence, I think I got that. It will be interesting to see what this week#s Sunday Times has in store for Boris.I don’t read the Sunday Times Petrus, but I can tell you that there is a seat in the hall of linguistic fame for Johnson. He has given rise to a new noun: boris. It replaces an eight-letter, rather rude one, that begins with a “d “and ends with a “d”. Suggested usage: Don’t be a boris, stay safe, stay well.Carrie Symonds!!

This means, for the purists, that the above good news story could have come a lot earlier.The increasingly tragic outcome, the delay and the ideology of this government of disaster capitalists are all directly linked.As for an eight letter word to describe superspreader Johnson, well frankly Rosa, I am at a loss. It is a letter short, but maybe #dullard# It would probably take someone with proper scientic training to know for sure.Led by the scientists indeed.Meanwhile, for those with a rudimentaryappreciation for creativity and the arts, I will offer the following, with an apology to those readers with more refined sensibilities: Ours us but to clap and cry.Another beautully poetic, uplting and helpful contribution has arrived, affording us the chance to step back and envision a better future.I think this touching poem as bedtime story is powerful enough to make most folk value the role of the creative arts in education and STEM the fixation that maths and science matter more.Not everything that matters can be counted and not everything that can be counted matters..."},{"url":null,"title":"seafood industry support welcomed by sfa ","story":"Shetland Fishermen#s Associationhas welcomed additional Scottish government support for #one of the most beleaguered segments of Scotland#s fishing industry#.The SFA also warned that seafood businesses should not be allowed to fail because of Covid-.A further £.m to help large sea fishing vessels was announced by the Scottish government on Friday, bringing seafood industry support to £.m.The latest scheme provides capped payments of up to £, per vessel to businesses with a vessel over  metres landing shellfish such as crab, lobster, scallop and langoustine # to help them meet fixed costs like insurance.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property.

Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected.

But with no likelihood of visitors coming to our place anytime soon, there is something slightly morose and sad about making the buildings and cabins look neat, well maintained and tidy.It all seems a bit soulless and Marie Celeste-like with no guests.While being locked down at home, being busy, fixing and decorating, and even dare I say it, having a good time with family, there is an emerging sense of frustration, even perhaps inadequacy.Others are out there being essential, being key workers and worthwhile, ‘fighting’ the virus, supporting the vulnerable, while I….make a patio.I think for many people, there is a need to feel useful, and it is perhaps why for me the motorbike ride is so important.While there is nothing heroic about delivering a few medicines, it gets me out of the house # we might have a big cabin, but it still induces a fever.Being part of a support network and involved in helping the community works both ways and fulfils a very real need in those helping.Perhaps everybody wants to feel essential.We can laud the NHS staff, care workers, shop assistants and delivery drivers, but no one is going to clap for the furloughed hospitality workers and idle outdoor instructors.As a volunteer, however, we can all feel that we are doing our bit.There is a huge grey area surrounding the concept of key worker and essential.At first glance, it may seem obvious as to who is key # doctors, nurses, carers and the like but then there are the people who support them.Key workers need paid, so require office staff. They need fed, so also use food shops.They need to get to work, so are likely to drive a vehicle, so they need fuel. Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

The house was always full of his music.Even in sadness, Jackie, who has been a stay-at-home mum since the birth of her first child, said her parents# pride in their grandchildren will endure.They lived long lives and they took great pride in their six grandchildren, she said.Mum was always talking about how pleased she was that they all got to university.She was one of nine children and most of them went to work in factories as soon as they left school.They#ve done more with their lives but that#s initially where they started out.Jackie added: She was so proud that all six of her grandchildren got to university.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Abbie Hartestudied for six years to achieve her medicine degree, which she was awarded via her laptop screen in a virtual celebration last Tuesday amid the Covid- lockdown restrictions.A rite of passage for all university students, Dr Harte said the virtual ceremony was a memorable way to mark the end of her degree, despite not being the celebration she had dreamed of.Queen#s students due to graduate this year were informed of the change via email. The university has committed to holding further celebrations in the future to allow graduates to reflect on their achievements with family and friends.Dr Harte said: Although a traditional ceremony would be nice to mark the end of our medical degree and a lovely way to celebrate with close family and friends, I think that we are all extremely understanding of the current situation and why we weren#t able to have a traditional ceremony.It wasn#t the celebration we were all hoping to have, but it was a lovely day and I was able to celebrate with my close family to acknowledge the end of a challenging six years.It#s definitely a small sacrice to make, especially when you see how hard all key workers are working at the moment.Dr Harte will soon join the fight against Covid- as she takes up a post in the Belfast trust months earlier than initially expected. Final year medical students at QUB have been granted provisional registration earlier than normal to help ease the immense pressure facing local health professionals.She continued: Covid- has affected everyone, daily lives have changed and many plans and big celebrations have been cancelled.I am just grateful that myself and my colleagues have been able to graduate early and can start helping out wherever we can.It was lovely to see that the majority of final year students were happy to take up this position and will be starting over the next few weeks. It does seem very daunting to start working in such unusual circumstances, but I feel we will all be very well supported.Newly-qualied doctors will take up posts in the hospitals alongside other clinicians where they completed their most recent placement.This is because they have gone through the induction process and are familiar with the hospital environment, fellow staff and procedures.However, they will not necessarilyto wards where they have worked previously as many services have been reconfigured in preparation for the coronavirus pandemic.Legislation has also been developed to enable final-year student nurses within six months of registration to go into the NHS in a paid capacity.Meanwhile, QUB law student Kristina Sundin-Maheralsaid graduates deserve a traditional ceremony later this year to formally recognise their efforts.Donning a gown and hat and taking to the stage to collect your degree is a huge motivation for students as they study for their exams, the Canadian woman said.Everyone was really looking forward to graduation, Queen#s do it so well and it#s such a prestigious event, she said. Queen#s put on the nicest day, they do such a great job. However, it#s understandable, there#s no way with the current situation that it could go ahead in July with so many people.I was really happy to hear they are planning to do something in future.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Please can you let me know , after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the question brought home the emotional impact of lockdown and that he hoped it would be allowed as soon as possible, although Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty warned that for some vulnerable groups, close contact with family may continue to be a risk for some time.Lara Crisp, editor of the grandparents# social networking site Gransnet, agrees lockdown has been particularly tough for grandparents as they#re more likely to be in high-risk categories and completely cut off from their beloved grandchildren.She says that the impact on grandparents# mental health is undeniable.A Gransnet survey found % of grandparents were concerned about their mental health during lockdown and even morewere worried about their children#s mental health.This is a tough time for all of us, but grandparents are finding it incredibly hard for a number of reasons, Crisp explains.What#s interesting is that worry about their children and grandchildren and maintaining those bonds supersedes concern for their own health.However, she believes many grandparents are finding novel ways to keep in touch with family and friends, often embracing new technology, and finding ways to support each other.Here, she outlines what grandparents are most concerned about during lockdown - and how they#re coping.Staying connectedGrandparents are working on new ways to stay connected, with % saying they#re speaking to friends and family more during lockdown and % stating they#re maintaining their social relationships well virtually.The positive side of technology has certainly proved itself in recent weeks through family WhatsApp groups, video calls, and online communities such as Gransnet. Of course, they aren#t a replacement for real-le hugs with your loved ones, but for now they are an excellent alternative for staying in touch, Crisp says.First-time grandparentsGrandparents who#ve been anxiously awaiting the birth of their new grandchild are now denied the opportunity to see the precious newborns.The exquisite joy of having a tiny hand wrap around your finger, or that new baby smell - these simple pleasures just can#t be conveyed across FaceTime. For now, grandparents are making do with regular calls and new parents are sending frequent photographic evidence of gummy first smiles and sleeping babes, says Crisp.ChildcareAlthough % of grandparents are concerned about the effect lockdown is having on their relationship with their grandchildren, this isn#t their only worry.In normal times, families rely on grandparents for childcare and grandparents are used to having this regular contact.Crisp reflects: Without it, many feel helpless. They can see how hard it is for their families to juggle working from home with trying to keep the kids up-to-date on schoolwork and feel they want to help in some way.She adds, however, that many grandparents are supervising their grandchildren#s schoolwork on video calls and taking part in bedtime routines by reading to their grandkids.This works bettergranny and grandchild have a copy of the same book they can read at the same time, she adds.Other suggestions include posting seeds and then sharing photos as they grow.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Long said Northern Ireland’s exit strategy should be based on a coordinated approach both cross-border and with the UK.“We need to have a strategy here in Northern Ireland that is coordinated with what happens in the south, because we are likely to be emerging on a more similar trajectory,” she said. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said she hoped an announcement would be made on the phased lting of lockdown over the next two weeks. She told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster, changes had to be “predicated on the science”. Widespread community tracing and testing has to be stepped up. Deirdre HargeyThe ability to do more community testing and tracing will have an impact on how and when restrictions are lted, she said.“If you are starting to look at easing, widespread community tracing and testing has to be stepped up,” she said. “A plan is being developed and brought forward to increase capacity and the amount of people who are going to have community testing and tracing – this absolutely has to fit with any plan in easing restrictions.”But she said the phased approach will be based on scientic and medical advice and not the “loudest voices” of public opinion.“I think there is a concern thatwe move too quickly that you will get a second run of this virus which would have even worse consequences for the public,” she said. Read More Covid-: Government proposals examine how office le could look post-lockdownLeaked draft plans for how the UK Government intends to get people back into work were revealed on Monday.They included reducing hot-desking, closing canteens, restricting numbers in lts and putting in place screens to protect workers. It was also proposed there should be more cleaning, staggered shts and more parking spaces for those workers that car-share their commute to travel separately.Under the plans, companies will have to draw up a Covid- risk assessment before allowing staff toto work, the documents suggest. The guidance also says social distancing will have to be maintained, whether on the shop floor, in shopping queues, or in communal spaces. Justice Minister Naomi Long pointed out that businesses in Northern Ireland rely on UK Government funding, which needs to be considered in the easing of restrictions.“Much of the funding that supports people through this will come from London so we have to be cognisant of that,” she said.“We can’t ask businesses here to stay closedthe funding to support them in that endeavour is drying up from London with no replacement.“We have to factor that into our plan in a way that in the south they don’t.”Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

PA Archive PA Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe funding will be aimed in boost the economy in the north west. Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA £m funding package for the north west has been hailed as potentially transformational for the region#s economy.On Monday, the Executive agreed to match UK Government funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds.This brings the total cash injection for the region to £m, which will be aimed at creating jobs, improving infrastructure and boosting economic growth.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood MP said he hopes some of the money will go towards the expansion of Ulster University#s Magee campus in Derry.Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive, he added.“This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and under-investment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton said the funding will progress some key projects in the area, such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the confidence and supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time. I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the Executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said the package was transformative for the entire north west region.“Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place, she said.“Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required.“While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended.“It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.”Finance Minister Conor Murphy has also announced funding packages for other Northern Ireland regions, including £m for the Belfast region , £m for the Mid, South and West, and £ million for Causeway Coast and Glens.Belfast Related ContentAnalysisJohn SimpsonOpinionRunning out of reasons why Northern Ireland needs more financial aidNorthern Ireland Executive ministers face a continuing critical assessment from UK ministers and the Treasury.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappActors Paddy Jenkins and Damon Quinn join family and friends to raise a toast outside Roselawn Cemetery in Belfast as the hearse arrives during the funeral of actor BJ Hogg. By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

The former Ireland captain spoke to the Sunday Independent newspaper yesterday about le after the Lions - and histo the farm.We#re all in pursuit of a purpose in some shape or form, especially when you recently retire from rugby, he said.That purpose was very much the match and the training. And when you retire, there is a massive void to try to fill. I don#t think you ever fill that very quickly, Best told the newspaper. It#s the purpose of #what am I going to be # I am no longer Rory Best, the rugby player. Rory who studied agriculture while attending Newcastle University - enjoys his new agricultural lestyle.You know, it#s a nice routine, he says. You get up in the morning. You go out to the cattle. It is this time of year where we#re calving the cows and we#re trying to get everything out into the field. It#s a lovely feeling - to drop the cattle out of the trailer and they have spent the winter in sheds, confined. You give them these open spaces and you watch them take off. There is something very satisfying about that. So, there are a lot of rewarding times and the weather has helped.At the start of the Covid- crisis, his middle brother Mark and sister Rebecca both ed from London to the family home in Co Armagh. That meant mum and dad and them were staying together, Best said. They self-isolated for two weeks. So, then dad wasn#t really allowed out. I took over doing all the farm work and tried to fill that to get that done. For Rory and Jody, his we of  years, the lockdown le has opened up a wealth of new opportunities to enjoy le with their children.I raised the flowerbeds from some wooden sleepers we had at home, Rory said.We had fun as a family planting those. I think, in this crazy world, you don#t ever think you have time to do these simple things. When you put it into perspective and you put it into that context, I think we just have to get on with it. We know what is happening.We know it is for the best, to stay at home and to stay isolated and remain positive. Otherwise, you#ll send yourself mad.Belfast Most ReadFuneral of Northern Ireland actor BJ Hogg takes place in Lisburn Family and friends raise a glass and say fond farewell to Give My Head Peace star BJ HoggWe need answers, says family of Ronnie Falloon who died from coronavirus in Lisburn nursing homeTributes flow after sudden death of talented Belfast teenagerNorthern Ireland farmer jailed for harassing his ex-we,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some people along the way to Stormont also wondered why I wasn#t running the k.But I#m hardly the picture of fitness soI#d run instead of walking, I would probably have put added pressure on the NHS because I might have needed some medical attention myself, erting the doctors and nurses from the real problems they#re facing.The Glentoran donation came from the Raven Glentoran supporters club, who meet in the same social club as the Linfield fans.Stephen Beattie, a member of the Glentoran club, said: People are always talking up the bad relationships between Bluemen and Glenmen but at the Raven club we all get on well.We were pleased to do our bit for the NHS fundraiser and it was made even more worthwhile by seeing Stephen dressed so well on Saturday.Sadly however, he turned down the chance to keep the kit.Belfast Most ReadFuneral of Northern Ireland actor BJ Hogg takes place in Lisburn Family and friends raise a glass and say fond farewell to Give My Head Peace star BJ HoggWe need answers, says family of Ronnie Falloon who died from coronavirus in Lisburn nursing homeTributes flow after sudden death of talented Belfast teenagerNorthern Ireland farmer jailed for harassing his ex-we,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’.

She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister, Conor Murphy hosted a meeting with representatives of the North West on April  to discuss the Magee Medical School, City Deals and the Inclusive Future Fund. Following the meeting, the Minister said: Today’s meeting was a continuation of positive engagement I’ve had over recent months with the North West.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. googletag.cmd.push Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy, he said. Today, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has welcomed the announcement of Executive match-funding for City Deals after the party first raised the proposals over five years ago. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said that Derry’s City Deal has the potential to transform the North West economy, driving new investment and attracting new jobs. Colum Eastwood MP said: “The SDLP has been fighting hard for fully charged City Deals with the power and potential to transform the North’s economy for over five years. Despite the initial disinterest from the Executive, we have always maintained that these deals would have a signicant impact on our ability to reimagine infrastructure, attract new jobs and stimulate economic growth. “In the talks that restored the Executive, I made it a personal priority to secure resource for university expansion in Derry. Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive. googletag.cmd.push “This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and underinvestment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Executive confirmation of a multi-million package for Derry has been warmly welcomed by Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson as ‘transformative for the entire north west region’. The Foyle MLA was commenting after the Stormont Executive today confirmed match-funding for Derry’s planned City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This is a hugely positive day for the north west and represents the culmination of a great deal of work over the last number of years,” Martina Anderson said. “Confirmation of the match funding means we now have a package of pound million between the City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This package will be transformative for the entire North West region and required the collective attention and action of the Executive, both governments and other partners. “Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place. “Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required. “While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended. “It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.” Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton also welcomed the approval of match funding for the City Deal and Inclusive Future funding package by Executive Ministers this afternoon.Mr Middleton said,“I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today of match funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. This doubles the total funding pot to over poundmillion, adding to the funding already secured through the UK Government.This will allow for progress on some of the key projects such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the Confidence and Supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time.I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine.

In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us. Ryan is a self-employed plumber andit wasnrsquot for the lockdown, he probably would have been ing to work sooner so itrsquos good for us to have this time together..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Not.jpg","title":"Paddy Mo’s greatest Down side of all time  ","story":"p.pp.pspan.s Paddy Doherty was a key member of the historic Down All-Ireland-winning team of . In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I recognised that one right away.Sandra Chapman column : JPIMedia \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I like to think that family le in the wider sense in Northern Ireland is treasured. Being of the baby boomer generation I do remember – just about – those years after the World War Two when my mother’s greatest treasure was her ration books or a visit from a spinster aunt who brought the treats we couldn’t otherwise afford. My aunt, , may have longed for a family of her own but we never knew or asked why she hadn’t married. I wish she was around today because her attention to us taught me, even though I was very young, the value of close family connections and the fact that our parents weren’t the only ones who loved us.I have several nephews and nieces now and I’ve tried to be a caring aunt, but it’s been dficult since I was a full time working mum and had to concentrate on my own children whilst not at work. By the time my children had taken up careers in other countries I tried to concentrate on the nephews and nieces but time was still always against me and they too were scattered to the winds.I have had to wait to what I call my ageing period to make any inroads into my relationships with them and being able to see them even only occasionally is a pleasure. But not now, with this lockdown thwarting me all the way. Family visits are out of the question as my sister reminded me in the early lockdown days when I was sure the odd visit wouldn’t matter. I’ve been fully in lockdown now for what seems an age.I’m certain that is what has revived my old back pain, my occasional bouts of insomnia and has left me looking much older than I should. Definitely. You see it’s not entirely family I’m missing - it’s the hairdresser, the chiropodist, the dentist, the dog groomer , my friends who live near and far, going to the shops and the prospect of not being able to pay a visit to my children and grandchildren - all of whom live in Europe. Boat or plane, it doesn’t matter, neither is available to take me there and equally they can’t come here. I think loneliness may be setting in.Himself is showing signs of impatience – that’s not how I describe myself – because, at this time of year, he would be preparing his boat for the summer sailing season. It sits, alongside a few dozen other boats, wonderingit will get it’s bottom scrubbed and anti-fouled this year before being released into the water amidst cheers of ship-ahoy and back slapping from the launching team.Being deprived of this ritual as, at the time of writing, marinas and harbours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland - north and south, are closed, is seriously bad for the old-salts brigade. All they can do is look out to sea and pray.We are well warned not to rush out of lockdown but a surprising number of people have run out of patience – not my generation I’m certain – with a sense of entitlement that puts everyone  at risk.One newspaper headline this week declared that ‘lockdown for a year would be a crippling economic blow’. The experts tell us it could cause a second ‘large and deadly peak’. Not attractive choices at all. We can do without those scenarios.Maybe it’s lethargy setting in, but I haven’t got round to ordering food on line as I’m happy enough with our corner shop, I’ll have to leave my hair to grow in its own unwieldly fashion and I don’t intend to fall out with the dog over grooming. The gypsy look will have to do.--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Regenerate, based in Portadown, has been allocated £, in the latest round of IFI funding. A total of £, has been pledged to support six groups across Northern Ireland and continue outreach work with marginalised communities.Pictured: Participants of the Regener project with coordinator, Tony McAleer. : User The funding will help sustain engagement efforts across local communities, develop capacity and ensure support for all throughout the current health crisis and beyond.The package was announced at a recent Board meeting and will be distributed across the Fund’s three core programmes, which all work with marginalised communities who have not previously or have only partially participated in peace and reconciliation activity.The Peace Impact Programme operates in areas with high levels of socio economic and social deprivation with a particular emphasis on engaging with disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to paramilitary recruitment. The unique Personal Youth Development Programme targets the most at risk - year olds who come from a range of complex backgrounds. IFI Chairperson, Paddy Harte commented on the funding: “The journey towards a peaceful society takes many forms and this funding is essential to help boost community spirit and leadership at an extremely challenging time.Keith McCann from Regenerate said: “During the current crisis we are working hard to deliver for our town. We have a telephone helpline working with over  people each week providing conversation, support and signposting to services. We are also working on new video content and running zoom online sessions to help reduce fear and anxiety. Finally, we are delivering food hampers and around  hot meals every week to those who need it the most. “For us, community engagement and support from the IFI is more crucial than ever. People are watching news and social media more and this information can often create fear within the community. Our work is very important and this funding will ensure we continue to keep connecting on a personal level and building trust with people.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
