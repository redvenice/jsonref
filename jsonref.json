We think the audiences are different. We have an important followship on EastEnders.\u0027It\u0027s a more younger skewing audience and actually EastEnders does incredibly well for us on iPlayer as well, so it\u0027s not just got a linear audience who may be choosing to watch Corrie and Emmerdale and EastEnders at similar times now, but actually we think the value of EastEnders on our on demand service for younger audiences is going to remain and we\u0027re confident in that.\u0027Mr Davie added: \u0027On iPlayer you look at most popular, EastEnders tends to be the most popular on a daily basis because so many people are catching up.We\u0027re not immune from competitive pressure, let\u0027s be honest about it. And you may have a marginal impact or an impact during that hour, but we\u0027re confident that the overall case for EastEnders development remains strong.\u0027The revamped hour-long national and international news on ITV will run from 6.30pm to 7.30pm when it is introduced in March.At the same time, Coronation Street will move to hour-long episodes at 8pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while Emmerdale will move to a daily 7.30pm slot.The schedule changes are likely to have irritated executives at the BBC as they will mean that ITV\u0027s soaps will clash directly with EastEnders, which is usually shown on Mondays at 8.05pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7.30pm and Fridays at 8pm.Meanwhile it has been claimed that any cuts to BBC funding will likely to hit coverage of live events such as the Queen\u0027s platinum jubilee, the Commonwealth Games, and the first Glastonbury festival since 2019.The corporation will also likely have to look at other areas to increase its income, such as BBC Studios, its commercial arm.Last week, Mr Davie refused to rule out axing services including BBC Two, BBC Four and Radio 5 Live.

Photograph: Carlos JuniorAny menstrual changes after Covid-19 vaccination are short-lived and small compared with natural variation in normal cycles, according to an assessment of the latest evidence published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ).Many women have reported changes to their periods after vaccination. Two new observational studies on the issue provide reassuring data, said Dr Victoria Male, a reproductive specialist at Imperial College London. The first study drew on data from 3,959 Americans who logged at least six consecutive cycles on a tracking app. Of these, 2,403 were vaccinated while the remainder acted as a control group.After accounting for other factors, the first dose of vaccine had no effect on timing of the subsequent period, while the second dose was associated with a delay of 0.45 days. Most affected were the 358 iniduals who received both doses of the vaccine in the same cycle, experiencing a 2.32-day delay to their next period – a scenario unlikely to have occurred in Ireland because of vaccine scheduling practices. Clinically significantAmong this US group, 11 per cent experienced a change in cycle length of more than eight days, which is considered clinically significant, compared with 4 per cent in the unvaccinated group. In all groups, cycle lengths returned to normal by two cycles after vaccination.A second study asked a group of 5,688 Norwegians whether they had experienced specific menstrual changes such as unexpected breakthrough bleeding or worse than normal period pain in the cycles before and after each vaccine dose. The high level of variation in normal cycles is underlined by the initial finding that 38 per cent of participants reported at least one change from normal in pre-vaccination cycles, which increased to 39 per cent after the first vaccine dose and 41 per cent after the second. The most commonly reported post-vaccination change was a heavier than normal period. ‘Natural variation’“The findings from both these studies are reassuring: changes to the menstrual cycle do occur following vaccination, but they are small compared with natural variation and quickly reverse,” Dr Male said, adding that much of the public concern around this issue arises from misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines causing female infertility. “Although we already have evidence that this is not the case – and evidence also suggests that infection with Covid-19 may reduce sperm count and quality – a deeper understanding of the effects of both infection and vaccination on fertility will enable better counselling of patients for whom this is of particular concern.”The two studies assessed are a step in the right direction but there is still much to learn, Dr Male said. For example, understanding the way in which post-vaccination menstrual changes occur, determining whether any group is particularly vulnerable so they can be counselled appropriately, and better defining the extent and persistence of these changes, she added.“The widespread public interest in this topic highlights how pressing a concern this is for the public. It’s time we started listening to them.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"findings of south kerry camhs review shocking very serious and unacceptable taoiseach says","story":"A HSE review examined the treatment of more than 1,300 young people who attended the South Kerry Camhs over a four-year period. Photograph: iStockTaoiseach Micheál Martin has described a review into mental health services in south Kerry as shocking, very serious and unacceptable.Mr Martin said there will be a full nationwide audit of compliance with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) operational guidelines by all teams.He said a prescribing audit will also be conducted in each of the 72 Camhs teams nationally and the Government will look at “any further measures required”.The Health Service Executive (HSE) report published on Wednesday morning said hundreds of children received “risky” treatment from a doctor working in mental health in south Kerry and significant harm was caused to 46 of them.The review was into allegations that young people who attended mental health services in south Kerry were prescribed inappropriate medication.The review examined the treatment of more than 1,300 young people who attended the South Kerry Camhs over a four-year period.The risks involved in the treatment by the doctor included sleepiness, dulled feelings, slowed thinking and serious weight gain and distress, according to the review.Mr Martin was responding in the Dáil to Social Democrats co-leader Róisín Shortall during Leaders’ Questions on Wednesday, who asked if there would be a wider inquiry into Camhs services around the country.Mr Martin said the findings demand “a fundamental review” of services, and not just those in south Kerry, and that it was not a “resources issue”.He said the first principle of medicine is to do no harm, but children had been harmed by “a complete failure of clinical performance and oversight and the entire management of the service”.“There was a systemic collapse here in terms of overall clinical governance and in terms of the overall management of the service,” he said.Mr Martin said there was a broader issue around recruitment of qualified personnel generally, “which we know we need to face up to”.Ms Shortall said the review was “shocking and distressing” for all of the families involved and that some children would have been waiting up to two years to access the service.“Instead of helping their children the service actually harmed them,” she said.The Dublin North-West TD said the treatment of the whistleblower involved, a locum consultant psychiatrist who has since resigned from the HSE, raises very serious questions about the treatment of whistleblowers in State agencies.HSE reportThe HSE report said: “This incident is the result a large number of events relating to the care and treatment of children, attending the Team A clinic, by a non-consultant hospital doctor, culminating in unreliable diagnoses, inappropriate prescriptions and poor monitoring of treatment and potential adverse effects. These events exposed many children unnecessarily to the risk of significant harm.”Having reviewed 1,332 files, the authors of the report found no extreme or catastrophic harm was caused to the patients in these files. Not all of the children who the doctor worked with were put at risk of harm, they found.The care and treatment of 13 other children by other doctors was also risky, the review found, and the authors found proof of significant harm to 46 children.This harm included production of breast milk, putting on a lot of weight, being sleepy during the day and raised blood pressure.The junior doctor whose work came under scrutiny did not co-operate with the review. According to the report, another staff member heard the person “was running a private treatment service from their home, sometimes seeing people privately up to midnight, and was also working in a private clinic in another county”.Enumerating the key causal factors behind events, the review said the diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) for secondary school children was often made “without the right amount of information from their teachers on how the children were at school”.Checks of observations of unwanted effects of medications “did not happen”, including pulse, blood pressure, and height and weight.“These observations were not regularly checked or not recorded properly. Necessary blood tests were not always done. The doctor was not available for interview.“We believe that the doctor thought they were helping the patients and did not intend to harm the patients they treated.“The exposure of the children to risk and harm by the doctor was because of lack of knowledge about the best way to do things.”The review also identified key contributory factors including the fact there was no clinical lead for the Camhs Area A Team. “This was one of the reasons for failing to provide and keep a high-quality service.”In addition, there was no consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist from 2016 for the Camhs Area A Team.While another consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist agreed to cover the vacant post until it was filled, it was expected that it would only be for a short while.“It took much longer than expected to find someone to fill the vacant position. Not enough attention was paid to the possible risks while this job was vacant.”The consultant psychiatrist supervising the doctor did not see problems that developed throughout 2017 and 2018.ConcernsConcerns about the doctor were first reported in 2018, but no proof was found that these concerns were addressed after being reported.In 2019 concerns about prescribing medication were clear, according to the report, and the supervisor at the time advised changes but did not insist these happened.The doctor worked extra hours and was observed to be very tired at work, but this issue was not addressed.There was no system used to check the prescribing of medications or the quality of service by the doctor’s supervisors, the review stated.In 2020, the doctor was recommended for other jobs even though there were concerns about him. And while a new senior medical manager started in the service, the concerns about the doctor were not handed over to this person.According to the review, the service has not put in place many of the recommendations of the National Camhs Operating Procedure 2015 or the Camhs Operational Guideline 2019.It did not have updated treatment plans that were shared with the patient, their family and the person who referred them to Camhs, nor did it name a key worker in all cases, a team co-ordinator or a practice manager.The Camhs Area A team had a lot more referrals of new patients than other areas across the country, and this had not reduced at the same rate as other services.Some of the referrals that were not accepted were not dealt with quickly and were left awaiting on a decision of acceptance.There was no shared diary, and reception staff did not know who was coming in for appointments. “Staff cannot quickly know who is working on a case. All of this means cases get lost.”Rules on looking after case files were not being followed properly. Staff and doctors were able to take files from the file room without signing them out, against HSE policies on the management of health records.In addition, clinical information was not always recorded in the patient file.The review said there is proof of two referrals and 10 full case records being missing these have been reported in line with data protection rules.While the Camhs has a governance group, this did not check it was working safely and effectively, or talk about the risks of a long-term vacancy.ResponseResponding to the review, the HSE repeated earlier apologies it had made to the 46 young people and their families who suffered serious harm, and to all 240 young people “who did not receive the care they should have”.“Young people and their families are entitled to expect a high standard of care when they attend our services, and the report makes it clear that this did not happen in a large number of cases,” Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer of Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, which has responsibility for HSE mental health services in Kerry, said.“As chief officer of the organisation, I apologise sincerely to the young people and their families for this. I want to reassure the young people and their families that we have taken on board the 35 recommendations in the report, and will implement them as quickly as we can.”The review team was led by an external Camhs consultant, Dr Seán Maskey, from the Maudsley Hospital in London, who travelled to Ireland to carry out this work.The HSE has already apologised to about 250 families for substandard care identified in the review.The review was prompted by concerns expressed by a whistleblower in the health service who alleged substandard treatment of clients of South Kerry Camhs.The HSE initially looked at the files of about 50 young people who attended the service, after which it was decided to carry out a “look-back” review of all files between July 2016 and April 2021.The report was posted to affected families on Tuesday, and a copy has been sent to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.The HSE is operating an information line for those affected – 1800 742 800 – which is open from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"irish economy is recovering at great pace taoiseach tells ff meeting","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told a meeting of his parliamentary party that the number of people employed in the State is running ahead of all projections.

The report said that hundreds of children received “risky” treatment from a doctor working in mental health in south Kerry and significant harm was caused to 46 of them.He told the meeting that young people had been failed by the Camhs service there. Mr Martin also told the meeting that the number of people employed in the State is running ahead of all projections.Mr Martin told his parliamentary party on Wednesday evening that the economy was recovering at what he described as a “great pace”, giving an upbeat assessment of prospects following the lifting of Covid restrictions. However, he did say that there were potential obstacles and challenges. “We recognise the challenges with energy prices and the cost of living. The Government has taken targeted measures in social protection and engagement with social partners will also be important over the coming months,” Mr Martin is said to have told the party’s TDs and Senators. Housing updateMuch of the meeting was taken up by a discussion on housing. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien gave a briefing on progress in the Housing for All strategy.“The pipeline of housing supply is very good,” claimed Mr Martin on the back of the briefing, pointing to an increase in the number of apprenticeships in construction. Several TDs and Senators raised the question of affordability for younger people who wished to own their own home, including Lisa Chambers and James O’Connor. Mr O’Connor argued for the Central Bank to ease its rules for housing to allow younger people access to needed credit. He told the meeting that young homebuyers found themselves caught in a clinch, as paying huge sums in rent each month impacted badly on their ability to raise deposits to buy homes. Minister for Education Norma Foley updated the meeting on the process involved in deciding what form this year’s Leaving Certificate will take. Irish Water was also criticised during the meeting for what one parliamentary party member described as the “extortionate” charges for connecting premises.

Video: Oireachtas TV .Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald: Playing the man not the ball? Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireDing-Dong! Mary Lou on high (horse).Maybe a bit late for a Christmas carol, but old scores were all the rage in the Dáil on Wednesday, where rage was also all the rage.But before we get to that, how about some good news?For in the midst of vicious exchanges on the housing crisis between the Taoiseach and the leader of Sinn Féin, there came confirmation from a gilded bunker in Baggot Street which gladdened hearts all across the land.Robert Watt, the Generous Salary, sorry, general secretary of the Department of Health, is now happily restored to optimum pay (nearly €295,000).This emerged in a one-line statement from his department: “The secretary general has confirmed that he is in receipt of the full salary for his role.”Having previously waived the €81,000 pay rise he was due upon moving from the Department of Public Expenditure to his current berth, the civil servant recently refused to tell the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee if this was still the case. Pointed remarks about transparency from two senior Government Ministers this week may have forced a change of heart.Because after a couple of gentle whacks from Darragh O’Brien and Heather Humphreys, The Generous Salary revealed he is now accepting his full whack.Word came through around midday, after a Labour Party motion on spiralling inflation and the soaring cost of living had given way to a rancorous clash on affordable rents.It lifted the spirits of our post-pandemic inflation nation.Shouting matchThe news sustained us through the bitter row over housing during Leaders’ Questions and helped us recover from an angry shouting match between Michael Healy-Rae and the Labour Party which took place just before.There is always an edge to the exchanges between Micheál Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, with the Taoiseach constantly annoyed by the Sinn Féin leader’s attempts to box him off as a supporter and enabler of billionaire property developers while he tries to explain what his Government is doing to tackle the crisis he repeatedly calls “the single most important issue facing our country at this moment in time”.Mary Lou has the justifiable anger and frustration of shut-out buyers and stressed-out renters on her side. She has an arsenal of harrowing anecdotes to draw upon. She has Eoin Ó Broin to throw his book at him. She has the entire dysfunctional mess of the property market for ammunition.Go fix it, she tells the Taoiseach. Fix it now. Do something. Do something now.He outlines the projects and schemes under way. He talks about the biggest house-building programme in the history of the State. Record “commencements”. Billions being spent. Construction bouncing back. “The momentum, as it were, is in the pipeline.”But it needs time and “a whole-of-government approach” and cross-party buy-in.Mary Lou McDonald gets to her feet.“So, you failed,” she tells him. “Let me help you, Taoiseach, to try and absorb the reality.” She holds up a photocopied page showing an advert for a flat to rent. Mad money. “So, this is a storage room . . .” she begins, before producing two more pages of equally dismal places for rent.Converted hallwayOne in Cork where “you could touch your fridge if you stretch your feet out of your bed” and a converted hallway in Dublin going for €910 a month.“That’s probably a snip, in your mind.”But she wasn’t finished with him yet.She had shown him the reality for Generation Rent. “Don’t you dare talk to me about false narratives or claim that you understand the crisis. You clearly don’t. While you’re there scratching your head I’ve told you two things you can do that will work . . .”If he does them, people might believe “that you finally get it”.Sinn Féin TDs cheered their leader as she resumed her seat.The Taoiseach rose, clearly annoyed by the personal nature of the attack. So he took the personal route too, stung by her parting shot that he doesn’t “get it”.“You paint a narrative in terms of me” – he pointed to himself – “as being orced from reality and all of that.”Across the floor the TDs couldn’t resist. “You are! You are!” they chorused.He put up a hand to silence them. “Okay. I just want to say to you, deputy, my background and where I grew up and what we had to put up with is far different to yours.”The Taoiseach was leaning forward, directly addressing his opposite number. He didn’t raise his voice but his anger was evident in those clipped, level tones.A few dissenting voices rose up. Again, his hand went up to quell them. He wanted to make his point, which he did, eyes still locked on his political rival.“Don’t you dare lecture me,” he said slowly. “Okay?”Bus driverThere was a sense of an old score being settled here by a man frustrated and totally fed up by the constant inferences that he is a heartless member of some detached, moneyed elite. Micheál Martin, the son of a bus driver from Cork city, who believes he incorporates the decent values of old Fianna Fáil, had had enough.“I understand the realities of life as well as anybody in this House. And I don’t pretend to understand it more,” he said as the heckling grew in intensity and the back-and-forth became more and more bitter, Eoin Ó Broin and Pearse Doherty joining Mary Lou in the fray.Still angry, the Taoiseach accused Sinn Féin of talking from both sides of its mouth and exploiting the crisis for political gain.“This crisis is too big for politics,” he said.Mary Lou McDonald shot over a pitiful eye, batting his words away with a dismissive hand as if speaking to a difficult child.“Stop that. Stop that. Stop that,” she repeated. “Stop now.”“Deputy, you are not the leader. You were not appointed by the Politburo,” snarled Micheál.“So just BACK OFF!”The Taoiseach’s unusual reaction was understandable – there is a definite element of playing the man and not the ball to Mary Lou’s approach, but when the Ceann Comhairle called time, one suspects Sinn Féin will have been far more satisfied with their afternoon’s work.Earlier in the day, it was Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae who took the chance to settle an old score. Last year, after lambasting the Labour Party for its lack of affinity with the plain people of Ireland, the Kerry businessman was badly roughed up by the party’s new deputy for Fingal, Duncan Smith.“I’m not going to be lectured on understanding workers. I do not have to put on a political costume and a caricature to pretend I am working class, like some,” Smith told the Healy-Rae brothers during his excoriating contribution.Cost of livingSo, when Labour brought forward a motion on the rising cost of living, Michael saw his chance to get one back for the team.“The people who are moving the motion are the people who wanted to put a water tax on everybody in this country and said they’d turn off the water if they did not pay the tax. These are the people who did away with the death grant you attacked every woman in this country you did away with their pensions you hurt them beyond belief.”A noisy shouting match ensued between MHR and the Labour duo of Brendan Howlin and Jed Nash.Michael repeatedly asked Howlin to shut up. He said Howlin and his crowd are nothing like the “old Labour” they once had in Kerry, people like Breeda Moynihan-Cronin and the Spring family. There were “good people”.This has the makings of an excellent feud."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives face 1997 style annihilation dont stop drift","story":"Time is running out for the Conservative Party: the epidemic of rule-breaking, broken promises and generalised incompetence and carelessness are trashing not just the PM’s reputation but that of all Tories.Without drastic, urgent action, the party will be sucked into the kind of death spiral that sunk John Major’s government in the mid 1990s, and a Left-wing coalition led by Sir Keir Starmer and supported by the SNP, Welsh nationalists, Greens and other rabble-rousers may seize power in 2023 or 2024. Such an outcome would be calamitous, and result in a vicious class and cultural war from which the country would never recover.There are now just two viable options if the party is to bounce back. The first is for Boris Johnson to remain in office, attempt to fix the immediate damage caused by Partygate, and then recant his worst policies and delegate huge amounts of power to a David Frost-like CEO in No 10. We would need the old Boris back: he would have to ditch the National Insurance increase, embrace a freeze on public spending and accept major shifts to his green agenda. There would need to be a clear-out of the Cabinet as well as advisers, with all the neo-socialists, green fanatics and pro-woke crowd exiting immediately.Every policy would need to be judged on whether it makes Brexit Britain more competitive, andor by how it improves the lives, and addresses the fears, of culturally conservative and aspirational Britain. The aim would be to ruthlessly target the 43.6 per cent of the electorate who voted Tory in 2019, but by following the broadly conservative approach these voters expected, rather than the weird blend of reheated neo-Brownite social democracy and green paternalism that was unleashed upon them instead.Crucially, the about-turn I’m describing is not about lobbing a few shreds of “red meat” to a starving base, penning random “Right-wing” tweets announcing a policy that unravels within hours, or even replacing a few figures in No 10 or Whitehall. No, only a total reset will do.The second option, regrettably, would be for Johnson to step down and be replaced by somebody who follows an improved version of the 2019 strategy. This inidual would need to grip a machinery of state recaptured by the Blob – and even more so now civil servants have been tasked with potentially terminating the careers of elected politicians. He or she would then need to impose, at great speed, an agenda that fuses pro-capitalist reforms while appealing to suburban cultural conservatives with a tough agenda on crime, human rights, wokery, Brexit and much else besides.Reverting to a Cameron-Osborne, Southern hoodie-and-husky-hugging approach would be calamitous, delivering even less than it did in 2010 or 2015: the metropolitan elites have shifted to the Left because of Brexit, the woke revolution and other factors, and in any case, Cameron was only successful when he briefly tacked “Right-wards”, taking on the SNP and promising a referendum.All other options for the Tories are a guaranteed disaster. Indeed, a failure to seize the moment risks jeopardising the PM’s two historic achievements: Brexit, and the political realignment which returned the Tories to levels of support last seen in the 1980s, giving them a mandate to reverse the UK’s decline.On Brexit, the job is a quarter done. We’ve left that dreadful, amoral technocratic entity de jure, although Northern Ireland remains unresolved. But de facto the only significant changes have involved immigration and foreign policy. Yet the former is being ruined by a shocking inability to control illegal arrivals from France, and the latter, a hugely significant and laudable gain delivered by Liz Truss, doesn’t affect normal people’s lives sufficiently.Yes, Truss has signed trade deals, but – through no fault of her own – she has been prevented from being as liberal as she could have been. All the other tweaks to the acquis communautaire post-Brexit could have been delivered by Labour. It would be extremely easy to rejoin the single market tomorrow given how little true ergence has taken place.Brexit can only deliver its potential if it is accompanied by a series of radical reforms. Yet for all of Johnson’s boosterism, the structure of the state remains unchanged the antiquated nature of the civil service untackled the tax system has become ever less pro-enterprise and pro-growth Britain is a worse place to do business than it was five or 10 or 20 years ago there is more regulation, rather than less freeports have been adulterated beyond recognition the planning system is a joke the universities are a mess and the schools in decline and the NHS is imploding as a result of systemic institutional failure, absurd gigantism and lethally misplaced incentives.This is madness. We need revolutionary shifts in a range of areas, from the precautionary principle to tax to reporting rules to the regulation of financial services: in each case, the UK needs to be the best place in Europe (and hopefully, the world) to hire, set up or expand a business, erect a new factory or recruit scientists. Unless all of this happens, the establishment drumbeat that Brexit has been a failure will grow ever louder, there will be hundreds of academic papers seeking to “prove” this “lack of success”, and by the late 2020s a Labour government will feel sufficiently emboldened to sign back up to myriad European initiatives. The Tories must erge so much that this becomes impossible.The Great Realignment is the other one of Johnson’s achievements that must be salvaged from the ruins of Partygate: the creation of a new coalition for the 2020s and beyond, consisting of Brexiteers, Thatcherites, blue collar workers, suburbanites, the aspirational lower middle classes (including a growing number of ethnic minorities) and wealthier Southern shire-dwellers. That coalition, at its widest, is stronger than the urbanwokeScottish nationalist alliance that Labour can deliver. The 2019 election saw people – especially in the North – who should previously have been Tories because of their lifestyle, interests and beliefs finally make the jump. This coalition is now in crisis, and must urgently be rebuilt.It can sometimes make sense to play for time in the hope that something turns up. This nightmare is different. The Conservative Party must urgently stop this catastrophic drift, or face the prospect of complete ruination.More from NewsCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servantsPrince of Wales: Portraits of British Holocaust survivors a \u0026#39permanent reminder\u0026#39 for new generationsHolocaust Memorial Day: Faith leaders remember victims of genocide with 600 candlesBBC to have ‘less people on our books’ as licence fee freeze forces cost-cuttingUS rejects Russian demands on Nato and Ukraine in hand-delivered letterMaida Vale killings: Met refers itself to watchdog as thousands demand ‘hero’ driver avoids chargesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london has lowest covid case rate country sadiq khan insists","story":"London has the lowest coronavirus case rate in the country, figures show, despite Sadiq Khan’s insistence that omicron still poses a significant threat to the capital.The London mayor has said that face masks will remain mandatory on the London Underground and buses when Plan B measures end on Thursday, and has called on the Government to keep them in shops and indoor venues.However, latest available figures show that seven-day case rates in the city were 850 per 100,000 on January 21 and had fallen nearly six per cent in the past week.In contrast, the rest of the regions are seeing case rates between 926 and 1,258 per 100,000.Business owners said that the requirement to wear masks on the Tube and buses was creating an atmosphere of fear that was putting people off from returning to London as normal.Hugh Osmond, who founded the Punch Taverns group and has invested in a number of the capital’s restaurants, said: “Being told to wear masks on tubes and buses creates a psychological message that people should still be fearful and not go back to work and not travel into the capital.“It’s a signal for people to be worried, which has a tremendously damaging impact on the economy and specifically the hospitality sector. It’s a destructive message which keeps people away from what they would normally do, such as visiting pubs and restaurants, and other activities. That’s not only economically damaging, but also to their mental health and wellbeing.”Fellow entrepreneur Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Pizza Express and Channel 4 who now runs a number of restaurants, cafes and hospitality venues, said mask-wearing rules were preventing people from resuming their normal lives.He said: “It’s taking a lot of people a long time to shrug off their concerns about travelling and going out and mask-wearing continues the narrative of fear at a time when in fact omicron rates are plummeting in the capital and it’s a far less serious threat.“Mask-wearing perpetuates the fear and acts as a constant reminder of disease and danger, which is very unhelpful for anyone running a business.“Most businesses want people to go back to the office for most of the time and mask-wearing doesn’t help that at all. It is stopping people from resuming their lives as normal and that is what we have to do.”Latest infection data from the Office for National Statistics shows that the virus is decreasing everywhere in Britain apart from Northern Ireland. The only age groups still seeing rises are children, which has coincided with the return of schools.The Government is still advising that people wear masks in crowded and enclosed spaces where they come into contact with strangers, although it is no longer a legal requirement.More from NewsCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servantsPrince of Wales: Portraits of British Holocaust survivors a \u0026#39permanent reminder\u0026#39 for new generationsHolocaust Memorial Day: Faith leaders remember victims of genocide with 600 candlesBBC to have ‘less people on our books’ as licence fee freeze forces cost-cuttingUS rejects Russian demands on Nato and Ukraine in hand-delivered letterThe Conservatives face 1997-style annihilation if they don’t stop this driftMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shakespeare del boy gave us phrases live longest","story":"When did you last say “Pip, pip”? Some opinion-survey company has been going round asking people if they use phrases like pip, pip or dog’s dinner. Since more than half the people asked didn’t use them, the survey folk concluded that “phrases that were once commonplace in Britain are seldom used nowadays”.When was pip, pip ever commonplace? It was first used in the 1890s to imitate a car horn, but we’re all familiar with it from P G Wodehouse – Pip, pip! Toodle-oo! Tinkerty-tonk! These were seldom off the lips of Gussie Fink-Nottle, and as long as Wodehouse is read, they will remain familiar to us. We’re not going to start using them seriously, only jocularly or with invisible inverted commas.“The survey’s a bit of a dog’s dinner, scientifically,” says Dot Wordsworth, the Spectator’s longstanding language expert. “Even the phrase that 78 per cent said they don’t use – pearls before swine – would be recognised by most. Otherwise, the old joke (sometimes attributed, like many others, to Dorothy Parker), ‘artificial pearls before real swine’ would fall flat. But it’s as popular as ever.”So it seems wrong to think that once upon a time we scattered our speech with noble phrases from the Bible and Shakespeare, but now can only summon up secondhand wit from TV ads, even if it’s true that some authors of letters to The  end them “Simples!”, for want of anything better to put before their signature.That’s bad, and I get quite annoyed to hear “Lovely jubbly”, as though it were bound in itself to bring joy, rather than being a mere catchphrase from Only Fools and Horses. It was first used there in 1989, as a tacit adaptation of “lubbly Jubbly”, a 1950s advertising slogan for an orange-flavoured drink in a triangular-pyramid packet. In my schooldays it was sometimes frozen and sucked free of its flavour through one chewed corner.Such phrases are annoying partly because they are associated with recent decades and have gone out of fashion, like words such as groovy or fab (though that has come back in, half-ironically). But an origin in Shakespeare is little guarantee of cultural superiority. Take be-all and end-all. Often it is used to express disapproval of someone who gives himself airs, thinking himself the be-all and end-all, as though he were the only pebble on the beach. Macbeth, though, used it in quite a different sense: that it would be fine if the murder he contemplated was the end of the affair.We deploy plenty of phrases from Shakespeare, unaware of their origins. The same goes with the Bible. The skin of your teeth is now used for “a very narrow margin”. It comes from the Book of Job in the very literal translation of the Authorised Version. What Job meant by “I am escaped with the skin of my teeth” is hotly disputed, but that does not affect its common meaning today.It’s trivially true that when people heard the Bible read out in church they often picked up phrases from it. Now we share advertising slogans in common: “Vorsprung durch Technik,” I heard Tim Harford say jocularly on Radio 4’s More or Less last week. How could anyone use it not jocularly?Yet borrowed phrases take on a life of their own – or become dead metaphors, better known as clichés. On the Today programme, someone said “across the piste”. I’d like to think that the phrase originated as “across the piece” (or “across the board”, as we used to say, with reference to a bookie’s blackboard of odds for a win or place). The broadcasting classes, however, are more familiar with the ski slopes than with a piece of work, and stick to the snowy linguistic high ground.Some phrases, though, slog through the centuries with surprising tenacity. A parent today may say encouragingly to a small child that it’s time to climb the wooden hill to Bedfordshire. It might be thought to go back to 1936 when Vera Lynn released a record by that name. But Bedfordshire features in Jonathan Swift’s dramatised collection of clichés known as Polite Conversation (1738). The fashionable characters round the card table grow sleepy and Colonel Atwit says: “I’m going to the Land of Nod.” (A place mentioned in the Bible, open to an obvious play on words.) Miss Notable replies: “Faith, I’m for Bedfordshire.”For those of a less savagely satirical mind than Swift, clichés can almost seem like poetry. After all, we hardly know why we like proverbs saying obvious things. “It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good,” we say cheerfully, to no apparent purpose.A proverb has made it when it starts being quoted in part: “It’s an ill wind...” “When the cat’s away...” “The proof of the pudding...” In fact, once a proverb is ground down, speakers don’t always know how to finish it. Instead of “The proof of the pudding’s in the eating thereof” (a nice archaic bolt-on), they erroneously come out with: “The proof’s in the pudding”. That’s not the extinction of an endangered phrase, just part of the endlessly playful development of language.More from NewsCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servantsPrince of Wales: Portraits of British Holocaust survivors a \u0026#39permanent reminder\u0026#39 for new generationsHolocaust Memorial Day: Faith leaders remember victims of genocide with 600 candlesBBC to have ‘less people on our books’ as licence fee freeze forces cost-cuttingUS rejects Russian demands on Nato and Ukraine in hand-delivered letterThe Conservatives face 1997-style annihilation if they don’t stop this driftMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"voters tiring labours legalistic boris hunting","story":"For a confident opposition leader who truly believes in what he and his party have to offer, it is obvious how to approach a prime minister hit by crises and scandals: you call for a general election.“Let the people decide” is a battle cry that is hard to argue against and stresses a politician’s respect for democracy and the instincts of the electorate.So it is telling indeed that Keir Starmer has not so far adopted such an approach to the partygate scandal, instead delighting in new twists and turns in the official process of investigation – from the Cabinet Secretary, to Sue Gray, to the politan Police – and continually demanding Tory MPs ditch the PM.Just as when he was one of those relying on the legal establishment to thwart Johnson’s effort to enact the democratic will on Brexit, so Starmer is once again expecting processology to knock-out an opponent Labour has never been able to defeat at the ballot box. Even now he has a handy opinion poll lead, he sticks with the approach of a lawyer rather than a leader.And it isn’t only Starmer who seems obsessed with enacting the removal of Johnson by order of the establishment. So does most of the broadcast media which leads its news bulletins on the latest breathless tales of social gatherings in No10 for day after day, week after week, no matter what else is happening in the world. Again, the atmospherics are reminiscent of the peak of the effort to block Brexit in autumn 2019.Despite the gulps which will have been caused throughout Downing Street by the police starting an investigation into its partying ways, my impression is that the fury towards Boris Johnson is starting to dissipate, at least among conservative-minded people. Tory MPs certainly report a dying away of email volumes about the matter. The conservative thinker Phillip Blond last night tweeted: “Out with 12 Tory MPs tonight across the range of the party – all think Boris will win a confidence vote and hopefully repurpose his Government around a real Red Wall agenda and all feel the alternatives to Boris Johnson are worse.”This is no thanks to the efforts of some of the PM’s supposed allies such as Conor “ambushed by cake” Burns or Crispin Blunt, who decided to turn his guns on the great British public, accusing millions of them of having flouted lockdown laws themselves. Polling by YouGov indicates how wide of the mark this is, with YouGov finding 68 per cent of people never knowingly broke lockdown rules at any point in 2020. No doubt Tory-leaning households, which tend to be older and more law-abiding than average, will feel especially aggrieved by Blunt’s unwarranted accusation. With friends like these, who needs enemies?Johnson has enemies aplenty of course, even on his own side. Ruth Davidson, former Tory leader in Scotland and no admirer of his, tweeted that her partner shared a birthday with the PM and she recalled her own experience of the day of his tea party in No10 as follows: “We marked it in 2020 by inviting one other household to sit outside, socially distanced, in our garden. It didn\u0027t occur to us – literally couldn\u0027t conceive – that we would act outside the rules.”As it happens, a relation of mine has a birthday around the same time and we did similar. And very nice it was in the sunshine of that glorious early summer. But that just serves as a reminder of the first lockdown and the fact that most of us weren’t desperate to meet up in large groups indoors for a spot of partying, but were in fact locking down out of self-interest – to keep ourselves safe from a deadly plague that had descended from out of the proverbial clear blue sky. Johnson and his inner-circle did not have the option of cutting themselves off from workmates, which probably explains why so many of them – Matt Hancock, Chris Whitty, Dominic Cummings and the PM himself – contracted Covid in the first wave, when treatment was by trial and error and the fatality rate was at its highest. Unsurprisingly, it was the larger man among them who got it worst and nearly died.If Boris Johnson did knowingly break his own lockdown laws and is prosecuted for it then of course he will have to go. If the long-awaited Sue Gray report is damning enough of him then there is still a significant chance that Tory MPs will bring him down via a confidence vote. But neither of those prospects now seems very likely to me. Johnson would seem to have an alibi of sorts for all the key lockdown infractions – the say-so of a senior civil servant in the case of the garden party, not being there in respect of the Christmas bash and leaving dos, having a surprise birthday gathering inflicted on him by his no doubt well-intentioned other half on June 19, 2020.Given what his administration was demanding from the rest of us, he deserves a rap on the knuckles and perhaps to be marked down by voters for presiding over a “booze culture” of sorts, with his own ready recourse to the wine bottle in working hours likely to have been taken as a cue by others among the 200 or so folk based in the large office building also known as 10 Downing Street.But to be driven from office over the heads of the voters by Keir Starmer’s monstrous regiment of nit-picking lawyers? I really don’t think so. As Jacob Rees-Mogg was probably trying to suggest in his erroneous pronouncement that a general election would necessarily have to follow any forced removal of Johnson, politicians and the media would do well to remember that in a democracy the most important mandates are given by the people.More from NewsCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servantsPrince of Wales: Portraits of British Holocaust survivors a \u0026#39permanent reminder\u0026#39 for new generationsHolocaust Memorial Day: Faith leaders remember victims of genocide with 600 candlesBBC to have ‘less people on our books’ as licence fee freeze forces cost-cuttingUS rejects Russian demands on Nato and Ukraine in hand-delivered letterThe Conservatives face 1997-style annihilation if they don’t stop this driftMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke push cancel fairy tales daylight magic","story":"Once Upon a Time there was a boy called Jack who traded in his cow for beans in order to demonstrate the merits of agri-entrepreneurship. But a wicked giant lived at the top of the beanstalk and all the exceedingly tall people were offended, so the story was banned.And Once Upon Another Time there was a sweet-natured girl whose stoical forbearance enabled her to triumph over a wicked stepmother and two ugly sisters, but her tale must never be told because all the blended families and body-shaming activists took umbrage.And now, Once Upon This Very Time, a live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has come under pre-emptive fire because, although it isn’t yet in production, it is already an affront to people of small stature and should be set alight with torches on the village green.The Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage, who has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, has decried Disney for “hypocrisy” after it trumpeted its ersity by casting a Latina as Snow White, at the same time as telling a “backwards story of the seven dwarves living in a cave”.Generations of children may have been enthralled by the fable of Snow White – one of fortitude, friendship and the potentially fatal consequences of accepting unwashed fruit from strangers – but in our literal and hypersensitive age, the depiction of dwarves within this enchanted fantasyland is now an apparently justifiable cause of outrage.This is by no means the first time this favourite fairy tale has been castigated. In May of last year the newly revamped Disneyland ride, Snow White’s Enchanted Wish, fell foul of cancel culture because it mimicked the classic cartoon with an animatronic prince kissing his princess to rouse her from her poisoned slumber. Complaints about this supposed sexual assault went viral, as ill will so often does.We appear in these moments to forget the original intention of these stories. Snow White serves for the entertainment of little children who still believe a kiss makes things better. This one was a classic long before the early 19th century, when the Brothers Grimm set about collating these “crucial repositories of human understanding and culture”, as the fairy tale academic Marina Warner puts it, that were passed down in an oral tradition that predates mass literacy.To obsess over the identity politics of Snow White’s dwarves – or, say, the “sexism” of evil stepmothers and wicked witches – is to ignore the simple fact that fairy tale characters are all cartoonish caricatures whose real purpose is to serve as vessels for far deeper moral lessons.Fairy tales are full of life lessons and stern warnings about the fate awaiting those who break rules or transgress a community’s boundaries. Little Red Riding Hood’s troubles begin when she ignores her mother’s instruction to keep to the path. Beauty and the Beast is a moral primer on not judging people by their appearance – especially when they are excessively rich. We lose the importance of these lessons if we begin to tamper with the characters that deliver them.Viewing ancient myths through a modern lens should enhance our understanding of our forebears and societal mores. Redacting their folk tales of evil queens and gallant knights is worse than letting daylight in on magic it is to drive a fairy coach and horses through a fantastical world that still has the power to bewitch us today.More from NewsCries of ‘cover-up’ over Sue Gray report, as unions call for redactions to protect civil servantsPrince of Wales: Portraits of British Holocaust survivors a \u0026#39permanent reminder\u0026#39 for new generationsHolocaust Memorial Day: Faith leaders remember victims of genocide with 600 candlesBBC to have ‘less people on our books’ as licence fee freeze forces cost-cuttingUS rejects Russian demands on Nato and Ukraine in hand-delivered letterThe Conservatives face 1997-style annihilation if they don’t stop this driftMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"6 questions everyone needs sue","story":" questions everyone needs Sue Grays report to answer - but it might not answerTop civil servant Sue Gray plans to send a full report to No on lockdown-busting gatherings imminently - after deciding it would not prejudice a police probeSue Gray is a top civil servant Image: PAByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Jan It was another day of chaos at Downing St as Boris Johnsonaposs government continued the wait for Sue Grayaposs report into the Downing Street lockdown-busting gatherings. Ms Gray, a top civil servant, is due to set out the facts around a string of gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall in  . The Mirror understands Ms Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. These facts could be enough by themselves for reasonable people to decide the PM either followed - or broke - lockdown rules. But Ms Gray might not actually say in black and white that the Prime Minister broke the rules. That’s because her terms of reference state “any matters relating to the conduct of Ministers” will have to “follow the process set out in the Ministerial Code.” The Ministerial Code adds: “It is not the role of the Cabinet Secretary or other officials to enforce the Code.” Instead that is for Lord Geidt, the Independent Advisor on Ministerial Interests, who can only start an investigation with Boris Johnson’s permission… and who can have his findings overruled by Boris Johnson. Did Boris Johnson break the law  At the time of many of the gatherings, it was illegal to gather indoors for social reasons with people not in your household. A key defence will be whether the PM and officials believed birthday and Friday night gatherings were “reasonably necessary for work” - an exemption under the law. Ms Gray’s report could shed light on this. If the facts she sets out indicate to most reasonable people that the Prime Minister might have broken the law, it will add huge pressure on him to resign. But she will not say in concrete terms whether or not Mr Johnson broke the law - that is a job for police, not civil servants. Police are now investigating a “number of” gatherings, and it will be up to them whether to issue fixed penalty notices against the PM or staff. But they could take months to report.  Was Boris Johnson warned about the May  ‘BYOB’ party or not  One of the key contested claims is about the ‘bring your own booze’ party in the Downing Street garden on  May , when outdoor gatherings were banned. Mr Johnson has admitted attending for  minutes but claimed he thought it was a work event. Crucially, he has denied being warned in advance that the event could break the rules. This is disputed by ex-aide Dominic Cummings. He backed up claims by a former No staffer who, according to the Sunday Times, believed “at least two people” told the Prime Minister it was “a party” and should be immediately cancelled. Mr Cummings said a senior staffer replied to an e-mail invite from top aide Martin Reynolds, voicing concerns, and that Mr Reynolds promised to raise that with the PM. Will Ms Gray’s report blow this defence apart  We don’t know. It’s a crucial question.  Are there photos of Boris Johnson with wine  According to Sky News, Ms Gray has been handed photos of Boris Johnson with bottles of wine at one gathering. But earlier this week, it was thought she was unlikely to include any such photos in her report - which was more likely to be presented in text form. She could, perhaps, allude to any such photos in the text of a report. But not publishing them would leave questions about exactly what evidence she received. It would also risk any such photos leaking out in a steady “drip drip” of revelations after the report was meant to put the issue to bed. Dominic Cummings - who Ms Gray questioned - has also claimed there are more photos yet to come out. Are there more incriminating text messages and e-mails  A bomb was lit under the Partygate scandal when ITV News published an e-mail from Martin Reynolds to more than  staff inviting them for a drink. The Mirror also revealed that No staff had “wine time Fridays” programmed into their electronic calendars. But other than that, many of the revelations have been based on sources and eyewitness accounts rather than documents. If Ms Gray reveals more incriminating emails or texts - especially any that involve Boris Johnson - it could be a fatal blow for some people’s careers. But it’s thought she is unlikely to write sweeping annexes of full streams of messages, or to name the staff who require disciplinary action. So there are questions over how far the report will get to the bottom of this in the eyes of the public. Were there gatherings in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s private flat  On multiple occasions since early December, claims have emerged of gatherings being held against lockdown rules in the private flat Boris and Carrie Johnson share above  Downing Street. Each time these have emerged, they have been denied as categorically untrue by the Downing Street and Mrs Johnson’s press operations. We don’t knowMs Gray has been told the same claims that were made to the press, including the Mirror. Butshe has - andshe were to make a ruling on whether the claims were true - that could be explosive for the PM and his we.

Instead they were given bleak advice for each worker to bring “your own personal mini-buffet” during the third lockdown in Spring . The guidance still appeared to be in force in November  - even after most legal restrictions were lted. Downing Street has tried to defend a cake-sharing gathering for the PM’s birthday on  June  by saying it was a “brief moment” between meetings.  Staff, the PM’s interior designer and his we Carrie gathered in the Cabinet Room in  Downing Street during the first lockdown, while indoor socialising was still illegal. Now Covid guidance for Department for Work and Pensions staff, leaked to the Mirror, appears to show the gulf between the Prime Minister’s behaviour and that expected from junior workers. The document, issued during the pandemic, described arrangements for “religious festivals, birthdays and retirements etc”.  It said “buffets and food sharing etc” were “not possible” due to “restrictions around hygiene and keeping your distance from other people”. It added: “There are alternatives you can consider such as bringing your own personal mini-buffet, finding a suitable socially distanced area where you can eat your own food together but stay safely apart, whilst ensuring suitable hand hygiene.” The guidance even told workers to “avoid passing cards physically to colleagues” and consider making a charity donation instead. And it said: “Any get-togethers for meals   drinks etc. outside the office should meet current Government and Devolved Administration guidelines.” The Jobcentre worker told the Mirror: “We in the lower levels of civil service specically weren’t allowed to arrange events based on sharing food. “So it wasn’t just  minutes and a bit of cake for Boris Johnson - it was a kick in the teeth. It’s relatively small in comparison to people who have lost loved ones. “But for civil servants at the very bottom to be following strict guidance while doing a gruelling job, as those at the top laughed and ate cake and drank wine together to let off steam, feels really unfair to me.” A senior DWP manager e-mailed the guidance to staff to remind them ahead of Christmas in November , four months after England’s ‘Freedom Day’. He wrote: “The use of DWP premises for holding any sort of s apart from normal business was curtailed some years ago due to an incident at a party.“At this time and given the current Coronavirus guidance, the holding of social s on a DWP site is not permitted.”The guidance added: “The best present is to know we have kept each othersafe from coronavirus.” The DWP was approached for comment on the leaked guidance.

But Downing Street had still not received Sue Gray’s report as of .pm tonight. And the Commons adjourned for today at .pm - meaning Mr Johnson cannot make a statement until .am on Thursday at the earliest.  That suggests No will not publish Sue Gray’s report tonight, eventhey receive it in time, because Mr Johnson would have little chance to own the narrative in Parliament. It follows days of chaotic briefing and counter-briefing over the report after Sue Gray concluded her work into around a dozen parties in Downing Street and Whitehall. It was thought the report would have to be delayed or split in two after Scotland Yard announced it would investigate “a number of” gatherings inside No. But it then emerged Ms Gray would send her full findings to No after all.  While there were concerns it could prejudice the police investigation, lockdown offences are punished with fines so any Scotland Yard probe is unlikely to end up in court. Boris Johnson ’s spokesman indicated the delay was due to checking with police, saying: “We need assurance that nothing we’ve received cuts across the Met”. No insisted its “intention” was to publish the Sue Gray report in the same format Boris Johnson receives it. The Mirror understands Sue Gray expects her full report to be published - but it will not contain all the evidence she received, and may not contain elements like text exchanges or photos of Boris Johnson with wine bottles. Instead it is likely to be a detailed summary, and could recommend disciplinary action against inidual staff but this would be kept secret. Boris Johnson could be interviewed by police over the parties - the first time a sitting PM has been grilled by cops in  years. The PM’s spokesman said he was not aware of the police asking to interview the Prime Minister in relation to the Met inquiry, but as a rule Iaposm not going to be getting into iniduals who may or may not be involved. Labour could use parliamentary procedures in an attempt to force the publication of the full Gray reportMr Johnson does not release it.That could take the form of a humble address, effectively a message to the Queen demanding the publication of papers. The Prime Minister has been speaking to Tory MPs in the Commons in an attempt to shore up his position while he waits for the report. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions earlier, Mr Johnson rejected calls to resign and insisted he was getting on with the job, although he acknowledged there were people who want me out of the way. The contents of Ms Grayaposs report could play a signicant role in deciding the fate of Mr Johnsonaposs leadership. Tory critics are waiting for its findings before decidingthey will submit formal letters of no confidence in him or not.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested Mr Johnson had misled Parliament about Downing Street parties, something which would normally require a minister to resign.Askedhe would now quit, the Prime Minister said: No. Sir Keir said: We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit. He said Mr Johnson and his Government had shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country. Mr Johnson replied: Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I donapost deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way. But he said Sir Keir wanted him out because he knows that this Government can be trusted to deliver. He added: Weaposre - and in particular I am - getting on with the job.  The issue of what form the Gray report will be published in appears to be a source of tension between the inquiry team and No . Sources close to the probe expect it to be published in full, although ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide. The steady stream of alleged breaches of lockdown rules have undermined the Prime Minister, but many critics have held off putting in formal letters of no confidence until Ms Grayaposs report is released. If Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench  Committee, receives  letters - from % of Tory MPs - a vote on Mr Johnsonaposs leadership would be held. Robert Halfon, Tory chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said Mr Johnson needs to reset his administration. I donapost need Sue Gray or the police to tell me or my constituents of Harlow that whataposs gone on has been pretty awful, he told Times Radio. We all feel let down and disappointed.

The inquiry chief wants the report to be published in full so needs their sign off before sending it to the Prime Minister. It means Mr Johnson’s leadership is still hanging in the balance - with No  anxiously awaiting the contents of the final draft. It could even be delayed until next week, raising the prospect of already mutinous Tory MPs encouraged to take action by angry constituents this weekend.The PM also faces being interviewed by police after Scotland Yard said Downing Street parties crossed the threshold for investigation. But the Mirror can also reveal that Mr Johnson’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, downplayed down the severity of the police probe in a meeting of Government advisors on Tuesday night.  “At worst it will be like getting a fixed penalty fine for speeding, nothing to worry about,” he told them.During a rowdy PMQs, Mr Johnson rejected calls to quit as he waited anxiously for the official report into the ‘partygate’ row.The PM insisted he was “getting on with the job”, although he acknowledged there were people who “want me out of the way” for a iety of reasons.  He and his allies have been speaking to dozens of Tory MPs in his Commons office over the last  hours in an attempt to shore up his position. Labour leader Keir Starmer accused the PM of showing “nothing but contempt” for the public over lockdown parties.The ex-Director of Public Prosecutions blasted: “If he misled Parliament, he must resign.” But pressed on whether he would now quit, Mr Johnson said: “No.” Mr Starmer said: “We now have the shameful spectacle of a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom being subject to a police investigation, unable to lead the country, incapable of doing the right thing and every day his Cabinet fail to speak out they become more and more complicit.”  The Government had “shown nothing but contempt for the decency, honesty and respect that define this country”, he added. Mr Johnson replied: “Of course he wants me out of the way - he does, and of course I don’t deny, for all sorts of reasons, many people may want me out of the way.” An indication of how damaging the Gray report could be for the Government came when Scotland Yard chief Dame Cressida Dick announced a police inquiry was being carried out. Downing Street has previously said the report will be published in full - and sources close to the Gray inquiry said that was their expectation.  But ultimately it is a matter for Mr Johnson to decide - and No  would only say it was its “intention” to publish the whole report. However, any attempt to hold back parts of it would be met by a barrage of criticism.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, tipped as a leading candidate to succeed Mr Johnson, said: “He’s admitted that mistakes were made and I % support him, and want him to continue as Prime Minister.”She claimed there could be “security issues” which mean parts of the Gray report are “problematic to publish”. But she stressed: “We have been absolutely clear that we will publish the findings of the report.” The steady stream of allegations over alleged breaches of lockdown rules have rocked No . Many of the PM’s critics, from all wings and generations of the Tory party, are waiting for Ms Gray’s report before deciding whether or not to submit formal letters to trigger a confidence vote.In a warning to wavering rebels, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested there would have to be a general electionMr Johnson is ousted. However, neither John Major, Gordon Brown nor Theresa May called one when they took over in No  mid-term.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyScotland YardJacob Rees-MoggLiz TrussTheresa MayBoris JohnsonCressida DickJohn MajorGordon BrownCivil servantsPoliticsDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But she was absolutely horried when she couldnapost fit through the turnstile. Someone saw me struggling and called out that they’d open the gates which was so embarrassing, because I was just too big to get through the turnstiles, she said. Everyone around us saw and heard it. The traumatic event stayed with her for years, but she was still unable to shed the weight and hated how she looked. But now at the age of , Amy, from Hatton in Derbyshire, has shed an incredible st lb - dropping from st b to st lb. The day nursery manager, who is mum to six-year-old Noah, said: I wanted to make sure I was here for my son and that I was fit enough to run around with him. That was why I decided to do something about my weight. I always knew one day I would lose it. I just never knew when. Amy wore a size  at her heaviest and hated seeing her reflection, but was finally shocked into action by her festive photos from Christmas  following months of comfort eating after a relationship ended.Amy, who stands at ft in, had a body mass indexused to gauge a healthy weight, of  - compared to the NHS healthy range of . to . - making her dangerously obese.With the support of her best friend, Lucy, , she joined a diet club online, started exercising in earnest and watched her waistline shrink until she felt like she had a brand new identity. Now wearing a size - with a healthy BMI of ., she said: “My real friends will tell me, aposYou were beautul then and you are beautul now.apos Some people have said, ‘I always knew there was a beautul face in there.’ But I’ve not done this for anyone , I’ve done it for me.  “I’ve always been the ‘Big Girl.’ I wasn’t bullied at school, because I hung out with the popular girls, but when they all had boyfriends I didn’t. “And I always hated PE and having to get changed in front of other people at school. “Throughout my le, when Iaposve looked in the mirror, Iaposve hated what I saw, as I just didn’t love myself. Remembering how she and her brother were fussy eaters and refused to eat vegetables as children, Amy also realises now that her parents splitting up when she was nine accentuated her already unhealthy relationship with food. She said: “My brother and I just ate crisps, potatoes, bread and sweets. “After my parents split up, we lived with my dad and I remember stepping onto the scales in the bathroom for the first time when I was  and being horried because I weighed st. It really hit home, because I knew my dad weighed st, so not that much more than me. ” After leaving school, Amy trained in childcare at college and landed a job at a local nursery, where she worked for  years. Then, seven years ago, she moved to the nursery where she works now, saying: I am very determined. “Once I have made my mind up to do something, then I don’t lose that focus.” And while she spent half of  comfort eating, after splitting up with Noahaposs dad in the May, she soon called on that gutsy determination to tackle her weight problem once and for all. She said: “I’ve always had a big appetite, so I’m not sure whether it was comfort eating or just the fact I didn’t care much about my weight after Noah’s dad left. Whatever the reason, confronted with photos of herself at her  Christmas celebrations, she was shocked into slimming with gusto. Confiding in Lucy, a clothes and shoe shop assistant manager, she said: “We’ve been best friends since we were  and although we were chalk and cheese physically, we really love each other, so I knew she would support me. Too shy to go in person to a slimming club, instead she joined WW online and was soon off to a roaring start.  And Lucy was there boogying alongside her when she started following hour long YouTube dance exercise videos. Amy said: “We both love dancing and when we go out, that’s what we do … we dance, so it was the perfect exercise plan for me to start with.” Each week Amy, who now restricts her calorie intake to , a day, weighs herself on a Sunday, which is also her ‘treat’ day. Preferring savoury to sweet things, she will still forgo all snacksher weight has gone up, so she can get back on track. She said: “I know people are surprised by my determination, because they’ve seen there’s nothing I won’t say no toit means keeping my weight healthy. “As a result, I’ve only gained weight about five times since losing it and I’ve always managed to lose it again. “A pizza is my all-time favourite food, but I will say noI need to. Another thing that happens when you lose this much weight is your digestion changes, so you then have to be careful about what you eat. Luckily, exercising alongside her weight loss has also helped Amy to reduce the apron effect experienced by many people, who have had drastic weight loss and end up with large folds of loose skin. She believes using a weighted hula hoop was key to toning up as the pounds fell away. At first, she ended up with bruises to her hips and thighs when she used it but is now an expert and can keep the hoop circling around her waist for an hour at a time. She said: “I’ve lost .ins from my hips and . ins from my waist - which now measure .in and .in - thanks to working out with the hoop. “When I started this, I couldn’t even run for a bus. Now, I run three times a week on my treadmill at home which is the equivalent of - miles each week. And Iaposm hoping to do a k run for charity.” Not only has her weight loss made her feel physically better, Amy says that psychologically, she feels far more positive. “I can go into any clothes shop and wear anything I want now and when I look in the mirror, I like what I see, she said. “I’ve learned to love myself and although it sometimes still doesn’t feel real, I know that I’ve achieved this. “People tell me I am an inspiration and that makes me so happy I want to cry. But even better, I can now race Noah across the field and run around with him in the park.”Amy’s main advice to her , WW Community followers and people who follow her on Instagram - @ww__ - is to never give up on their own weight loss goals.She said: “If you have a bad day or a bad week or a bad month, just move on and start again. “I’ve had a motto for some time now which is, ‘I can and will. Watch me.apos This, basically, says to anyone that ever doubted what I was capable of, that actually it is and was possible. As for Amyaposs son, Noah, he just has one question for his mum.

The Romanian rescue dog had a devastating virus named distemper, which she fought with all her might to survive but left her with a permanent tremor. An angel lady in Romania nursed her back to health and taught her how to trust, before transporting her to a Manchester dog sanctuary. The Dogs  Rescue team took Damaris into their care in October, and after just three days, she was scooped up for adoption where she fitted in right away with her new family. On Monday, Dogs  Rescue shared the amazing news on theirFacebook pagein a touching post that read: “We know you’ll all be thrilled with this happy ending. Damaris has been adopted into a forever home.“We chose to rescue Damaris as she was a dog no-one  wanted. “She had suffered distemper as a pup, a highly contagious devastating viral disease which she fought with all her might to survive. “It left her blind in one eye and with a permanent tremor which made her a little dferent. “But we thought she was perfect and wanted to give this fighter a chance of real happiness. “She arrived from Romania on the happy bus in October. She was such a gentle girl. “We thought she may be with us a while in order to build her trust, but she was one of the ones that surprised us, and went on to foster within a few days and settled in brilliantly. “At the end of October, she went to live with Louise, her family and new fur brother Jerry, for her trial which we’re so pleased to announce has now become her forever home.”  Damaris’ new adopted owner Louise said: “Thank you so much for letting us home Damaris. It’s safe to say we all fell in love with her straight away. “She’s hilarious and fiesty and doesn’t let anything hold her back - she’s definitely the boss of the house! “She’s fitted in right away. If she’s not sleeping she’s playing with Jerry or telling him off when he snores. “When I saw her photo my heart melted and I knew I would do anything I could to give her a good le. “Her missing eye and tremors make her even more special to us. “Thank you to Emma for trusting us with her and also her rescuer who originally saved her for making this possible.” The Facebook post received more than , likes and  comments.One supporter wrote: “This brought a tear to my eye. She wouldnapost have stood a chance in a kennel rescue. Big thank you to her new family for giving her a chance.” Another said: “I’m crying with happiness for Damaris and her family… DR is awesome.” A third commented: “Another post from you that brought me to tears ....of happiness..... for one of your beauties finding their family.

At first I thought it was a plane about to crash, but I realisedit was a plane about to crash it wouldaposve been going down,” he said.The youngster, who attends Wellfield Junior School, posted the video online which has since attracted hundreds of views.  Mum Yvonne, , said: The children come out with rubbish all the time”. “So you donapost really pay a lot of attention to it. But then I saw the video and I thought: aposActually, thataposs weirdapos. I said: aposYouaposd better start looking out for a bit of rock, it might be worth some moneyapos. I was going to send them down to Ashton Park to see where it landed.Late last year the Mirror reported on a meteor that was captured by a Darlington local’s doorbell camera as it shot through the sky one evening.The doorbell camera was filming after a family cat activated the recordingjust in the nick of time.  Julie Richardson, from Darlington, in the north east, said she “didn’t quite believe it” when her husband, Lee, showed her what their new doorbell camera had captured. Julie’s family cat, Stanley, is filmed between two vehicles at the bottom of the footage and happened to be walking past at just the right time to set the camera rolling. After walking theof the car, Stanley sits down on the drive, where he stays put until the impressive display is over. He then turned around and scarpers back towards the house. The fireball was spotted in Peterlee and the Northumberland coast, with residents also commenting that they saw the meteor after Julie shared the footage on social media. Julie said: I didnapost quite believe it, my husband Lee was the one that spotted it. I just thought it was a firework but that didnapost make sense as the aposfireworkapos was going down not up.”She said she put it on Facebook “just to see what other people thought about it” and came to the conclusion that it was “definitely a meteor”.The UK Meteor Network also shared several images of a meteor spotted that same evening.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"d day hero who carried","story":"D-Day hero who carried wounded soldier over shoulder for  miles under fire dies at Denis Bounsall survived three dferent assault landings in eleven months, including D-Day, and won a Distinguished Conduct Medal for bravery.

I was told by the caretaker that it closed in . “A lot of capital was put into this site as it is enormous, with an opulent architectural design rarely seen in Thailand. The original site had over a dozen buildings aside from the main grounds, which included stables and both an indoor arena and outdoor playing field.  “The clock fountain, furniture, ornate staircases and decaying piano were the highlights for me, with the clock fountain being the most interesting  Dali-esque feature. “They really bring out an undeniable surrealist aesthetic.”  Dax added that he could understand why ghost hunters may pick up some activity in the abandoned location, as there were some definite ‘spooky’ spots. He said: “I have a Thai ghost-hunter friend who has spent time at the polo club with his paranormal team. “I’m not surethey found anything but wouldn’t be surprisedthey did, as the place, although beautul, has some spooky spots.  “Walking around the facility, it isnapost hard to imagine horses and riders scurrying around during and between matches, people having drinks at the bar and spectators watching the action on the fields. “The few short years that it was in operation must have been a sight to behold. “Nowadays, as is obvious from the pictures, everything is decaying and being overtaken by flora and fauna.  The aposfaunaapos being a pack of aggressive soi dogs, snakes and lizards, as well as the fish in a nearby canal, which seems to be a popular local spot to cast a line. “I really enjoyed visiting this location and would put it easily in the top  of my favourite abandoned sites in Thailand.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Abandoned placesThailand\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether. Here are the rules being removed tomorrow and what will remain. What restrictions will be removed when Plan B ends As of Thursday, January , Covid passes for large venues will end. However, Boris Johnson said that venues would have the right to choose on whether or not they want to continue with the policy.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. Though the government no longer mandates wearing masks in any setting, Johnson added urged that people should still think about wearing a mask when in public environments, particularly in crowded or enclosed spaces. Restrictions on visiting care homes will also be eased. But Mr Javid warned that the end of Plan B shouldnapost be seen as the finish line. He urged people to continue taking protective measures including washing hands, ventilating rooms and self-isolatingpositive. Anyone who has yet to receive their Covid vaccines are also being urged to come forward. Which Covid rules will remain   Along with self-isolating for at least five full daysyou get a positive Covid test, the requirement to take lateral flow tests when travelling internationally will remain in place. While legal requirements stay in place for now, Johnson said he hoped to not have to renew self-isolation rules when they expire on March . He added that the aim is to remove the legal requirement for people to isolate after testing positive and replace it with advice and guidance as the virus becomes endemic.  For now, anyone planning to travel abroad need to book and pay for a Covid test before coming back to England - although this will change on February  from amyouaposre double-vaccinated. From now until then the test - either lateral flow or PCR - will have to be taken after you arrive back. If the test comes back positive, you need to self-isolate. Those who arenapost fully vaccinated need to book and pay for day two and day eight tests. You will also have to quarantine at home or the place youaposre staying for  full days. If youaposve been fully vaccinated then you donapost need to isolate for  days unless you test positive on or before day two.Everyone also needs to complete apassenger locator formbefore travelling back to the UK.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusPlan BOmicron iantBoris Johnson\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Early data suggests that BA., a sub-iant believed to have emerged from a mutation of the Omicron coronavirus iant, may be both more transmissible and better able to evade vaccines than the more common BA. sub-lineage.Currently the BA. lineage accounts for % of all cases globally but in Denmark, the BA. has grown rapidly.In the last week of , it accounted for % of all Covid- cases. By the second week of , it accounted for % of cases. On Wednesday, it was reported that BA. had become the dominant strain in Denmark.In a national address on Wednesday, Danish Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said: “There is no evidence that the BA. iant causes more disease, but it must be more contagious.”  Initial calculations by Denmarkaposs top infectious disease authority, Statens Serum Institut, show BA. could be . times more infectious than BA.. So far, early data has not shown a dference in the risk of hospitalisation for BA. compared to BA.. There is some indication that it is more contagious, especially for the unvaccinated, but that it can also infect people who have been vaccinated to a greater extent, SSIaposs technical director Tyra Grove Krause said at the briefing on Wednesday. The BA. has been nicknamed “stealth Omicron” as it is poses a challenge for scientists to track, unlike the original Omicron that stood out on the widely-used PCR tests without the need for extra genome sequencing. The new strain shows up as being S-gene positive under PCR tests, whereas the BA. did not.  According to the World Health Organisation, BA. sequences have been reported in more than  countries, including the UK, Sweden, Norway, Singapore and India. On Friday, the UK Health Security Agency designated BA. a “iant under investigation” – one level below a “iant of concern” – saying it could have a growth advantage. It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so itaposs to be expected that we will continue to see new iants emerge, Dr Meera Chand, incident director at the UKHSA, said. Our continued genomic surveillance allows us to detect them and assess whether they are signicant.  So far, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether BA. causes more severe illness than omicron BA., but data is limited and UKHSA continues to investigate.” In the UK, some  cases of the BA. sub-lineage have been sequenced, according to Reuters, and the UKHSA said early analysis suggested an increased growth rate compared to BA.. Imperial College London’s Tom Peacock, one of the first virologists to raise the alarm over Omicron, tweeted that very early observations from India and Denmark suggest there is no dramatic dference in severity compared to BA.. This data should become more solidin the coming weeks.” He added that there is likely to be minimal dferences in vaccine effectiveness against BA. and BA.. Personally, Iaposm not sure BA. is going to have a substantial impact on the current Omicron wave of the pandemic. Several countries are near, or even past the peak of BA. waves. I would be very surprisedBA. caused a second wave at this point. Even with slightly higher transmissibility this absolutely is not a Delta-Omicron change and instead is likely to be slower and more subtle, he continued.

However, she claims that on the night of one of their alleged encounters, Andrew sweated heavily as they danced at Tramp nightclub in London.  The Prince told Newsnight: There’s a slight problem with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time and that was…was it…yes, I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falkland’s War when I was shot at and I simply…it was almost impossible for me to sweat.

City of London Magistrates’ Court heard self-styled “international DJ” Maressa Innerarity, who also goes by the name Carmen London, was not the event’s organiser but arrived with her own sound system. Prosecutor Nathan Paine-Davey said this is enough to charge her with holding or being involved in holding a rave type gathering in England of more than  people indoors. Innerarity admitted the offence on the first day of a trial.The party was held three days before an alleged Downing Street flat party on the same day as Boris Johnson ’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and communications director, Lee Cain, left their roles.The prosecutor said: “This relates to November  and . The defendant has been charged with an offence against the public protection coronavirus restrictions regulations which were in force on November , .“On November , the police were called to Poyser Street as a result of a complaint of noise from a resident in the block of flats. They believed that there was some sort of event going on. When police arrived they met with local officers and they could hear loud music coming from the location and approximately  to  people in the street leading up to the location. A cordon was placed on the street. At that point, police entered the building and stopped the unlicensed music event. It is believed  to  people were in the premises. Itaposs described as a squat - itaposs a warehouse-type building with very low ceilings. The court was shown police body-worn footage of attendees “pouring out” of the venue after officers shut down the event.  Mr Davey-Paine said: She accepted at the scene the music equipment was indeed hers and she was then warned she may well be prosecuted under the regulations. Clearly it was unlikely that that number of people would gather in such a space simply to have a chat. I donapost say the defendant organised it but the presence of her musical equipment and obviously she has been employed as a disc jockey previously. There is no evidence she was in fact operating that equipment. Eric Kawoya, defending, said Innerarity had been asked by two friends named aposGabriel and Jamalaposthey could borrow her sound equipment. He told the court his client did not know the equipment would be used for a party. Mr Kawoya said: She packed them in the car and drove to the venue. She was not told what kind ofwas taking place. When she arrived at the venue at the time the place was empty but as time went by, people started to arrive. She had cause for concern and she asked what was going on and they said to her not to worry. She then stayed around. She was not given any sort of money for this. She couldnapost leave because she was concerned for the safety of the speakers and damage to the speakers.The court heard Innerarity has not worked in two years and is on Universal Credit.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

It was sufficiently disturbing to neighbours that police were called. Most signicant of course this was during the national lockdown that began on November . That is a fact of which you were aware as of course was everyone at the event. It is clear from the video footage that people were crowded into a cramped location. It was a blatant breach of the lockdown and coronavirus regulations in force at the time. You said you didnapost appreciate what they would be used for but it was inconceivable that you did not appreciate the gathering was used for some kind of unlawful gathering during the lockdown.It is hard to imagine an event more likely to spread Covid- than the sort of event being held on this occasion.What those attending may have been willing to risk is not only their own health and wellbeing, they risked the health and wellbeing of others who they may be in contact with subsequently and they may be more vulnerable. Those who attended this event were acting in a supremely selfish way. Innerarity, of Tooting, south London, was fined £, and ordered to pay £ prosecution costs and a £ surcharge.

Iain Francis, , had recently retired to India and was enjoying his daily ritual of yoga practice at the riverside by his hotel when he accidentally fell into the water and drowned. The dad-of-three, from Moretonhampstead, is believed to have hit his head during the fall on March , , and is likely to have been unconscious by the time he went into the water.An inquest at Exeter’s County Hall on January , heard the family had endured a long wait for more information surrounding his death from the Foreign Commonwealth Office and Indian police authorities due to the coronavirus pandemic, reports Devon Live. The -year-old, who had no known medical conditions, was described by his daughter Angela as having been aposextremelyapos healthy and fit for his age and did yoga every day to help ease pain in his hips, knees and sometimes also his feet.  In a statement, she recalled: He went to India in October  to enjoy this retirement warmer climate where he could stretch and climatise. He intended indeed to come back in the spring. Mr Francis had previously been a plumber for many years but also had an extensive career working in microfinance as a financial consultant in foreign agricultural programmes. He worked in  countries including Nigeria, Vietnam and Bangladesh. After retiring he travelled to India on his own and had been staying in the district of Koppal in Karnataka. The location of his death was Hanumanahalli Thungabhandra River Gangavathi. His daughter recalled the majority of his trip had been spent near the sea in Goa. Angela said: He was a strong swimmer, although he did not attempt to go in the water much or for long periods in later years.  The manager of the hotel where Mr Francis was staying told police in India that every day he would do yoga and body exercises at a riverbank near the hotel. On the day of his death he left the hotel at .pm and at pm the hotel manager was informed he had fallen in the river. He recalled he had gone to the river and saw Mr Francis floating in the water wearing shorts, and his belongings were on the bank of the river. The police investigation confirmed Mr Francis had accidentally fallen down into the river and had hit his head on a rock on his way into the water. The conclusion was he had died by accidental drowning and there was no third party involvement. A post mortem examination conducted in India confirmed the cause of Mr Francisaposs death was drowning. It was noted that there were lacerations to his scalp and a deep injury on the left side of the top of his head. Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Philip Spinney said: “The deceased died from the effects of drowning.” Following the inquest, his daughters paid tribute to Mr Francis and said: Our dad was wonderfully caring, funny, sensitive and generous. He had a spirit, heart and presence like no one  and he will always be dearly missed.

People crossing at junctions  According to the government, the new update will mean that:When people are crossing or waiting to cross at a junction, other traffic should give waypeople have started crossing and traffic wants to turn into the road, the people crossing have priority and the traffic should give way people driving, riding a motorcycle or cycling must give way to people on a zebra crossing and people walking and cycling on a parallel crossingA parallel crossing is similar to a zebra crossing, but includes a cycle route alongside the black and white stripes. Walking cycling and riding in shared spaces  Shared areas will ask that people on pushbikes respect the safety of people walking, although pedestrians too must take care not to endanger anyone. The government says: People cycling are asked to:not pass people walking, riding a horse or driving a horse-drawn vehicle closely or at high speed, particularly from behind slow down when necessary and let people walking know they are thereremember that people walking may be deaf, blind or partially sighted avoid passing a horse on the horse’s leftPositioning in the road when cycling  The road position that cyclists take up when using highways is due to have updated guidance. The government will now ask cyclists to begin:riding in the centre of their lane on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions or road narrowings keeping at least . metresaway from the kerb edgewhen riding on busy roads with vehicles moving faster than themThis section of the code will also impact people riding in groups, saying they:should be considerate of the needs of other road users when riding in groups can ride  abreast - and it can be safer to do so, particularly in larger groups or when accompanying children or less experienced riders Cyclists are also asked to be aware of people driving behind them and let them overtakethey wish to. This might include moving into a single file or even stoppingnecessary.It also discusses that people riding bikes need to:take care when passing parked vehicles, leaving enough roomto avoid being hita car door is opened watch out for people walking into their pathOvertaking when cycling  Updates are expected about safe passing distances, as well as speeds. The government say this will include:leaving at least . metreswhen overtaking people cycling at speeds of up to mph, and giving them more space when overtaking at higher speeds passing people riding horses or driving horse-drawn vehicles at speeds under  mph and allowing at least  metresof space allowing at least  metresof space and keeping to a low speed when passing people walking in the road This also means waiting behind someone and not overtaking until it is safe to do so by meeting these spaces. The update will also confirm that people cycling may pass slower-moving or stationary traffic on their right or left, although they are advised to be careful as people they pass might not be able to see them. People cycling at junctions  When turning in or out of a side road you need to give way to people waiting to cross or who are already walking across. The government also say: Some junctions now include small cycle traffic lights at eye-level height, which may allow cyclists to move separately from or before other traffic. People cycling are encouraged to use these facilities where they make their journey safer and easier. If there are no separate cycling facilities on a junction, then people on bikes should behave in the same way as car drivers. This will mean, where safe, positioning yourself in the middle of your correct lane at junctions. When it comes to turning right, advice is be handed down for cyclists using junctions that involve making the turn in two stages:stage  - when the traffic lights turn green, go straight ahead to the location marked by a cycle symbol and turn arrow on the road, and then stop and wait stage  - when the traffic lights on the far side of the junctionturn green, complete the manoeuvre The new advice also adds that people on bikes have priority when going straight ahead on junctions.They have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise, the government says. People cycling are asked to watch out for people driving intending to turn across their path, as people driving ahead may not be able to see them. Cycling on a roundabout  Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should:not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundaboutCyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.

Plans have been submitted for a two-storey restaurant in Bolton town centre to serve the classic late night feast to both indoor diners and passing drivers. Documents suggest converting an empty premises into the drive-thru restaurant under the German Doner Kebab name. It would transform the currently shabby and deserted building into an urban chic kebab joint equipped for all.Glossy CGI images published by Bolton Council in support of the application show its intended transformation, reports Manchester Evening News.The site was previously used by charities including the Mental Health Independent Support Team and Bolton NICE, which develops community and business enterprises and job opportunities.  Synergie Holdings submitted the proposal and opening hours for the venture are unknown at this stage. Five on-site parking spots would be created at the site, according to the application. Responding to the form, Boltonaposs highways department said it will need more information before giving an opinion. It said: “Owing to the premises location in relation to the highways around the town centre of Bolton, the applicant will need to submit some form of transport statement in order to justy the proposed change of use.  “The statement should provide a rough indication as to how accessibility to the premises will be controlled and how abuse of the one-way system on Gas Street will be prevented, as well as giving a rough indication of traffic impact from the proposed use. “In its present form there is insufficient information available within the submission for the Highway Authority to fully comment.” The drive-thru kebab restaurant will be considered by planners in Bolton after a period of consultation with neighbours.

Health experts have issued a medical warning regarding his activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic.Mr Jones, , himself told Derbyshire Live heaposs had a lot of people question him over why he does it, but believes they would understandthey saw the happiness it brings to the families he provides his free donations to. He said: Iaposm probably the worldaposs most prolic sperm donor with now being at  aposbabiesapos, well,  babies born, nine ongoing pregnancies. I might continue for another few years. Get to  anyway. I know of clinics and sperm merchants with greater numbers but they donapost donate, but rather sell semen. I think people would understand morethey saw the messages I get and the photos of the babies with very happy mothers. I feel the happiness it brings. I once had a grandmother message me thanking me for her granddaughter. I do it for free, though sometimes ask a bit for petrol. Itaposs illegal to charge and doesnapost seem right to take money when I have more than them. Mr Jones, who has three grown-up children of his own, said: It all started in May, over nine years ago. For some people, having children is very important as it was for me. I read in some newspapers the plight of some people that canapost have children. Reading the newspaper, it explained how people were using Facebook to make arrangements. I thought I could help so I put a post on one of the sites. I wasnapost expecting any response with me saying how old I was, but I had a lady in Derby contacting me within an hour asking me to help that evening.  Iaposve not advertised Iaposm a donor in years. It has not quite worked out as I had guessed, Iaposm just as busy now and have so many people contact me through people just talking, referring. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has issued a medical warning regarding Mr Jonesapos activities, saying that all donors and patients should be treated at a licensed UK clinic. A spokeswoman for the authority said: As the regulator of UK fertility treatment and research we donapost have the powers to stop people from making their own arrangements for sperm donation but we do want to help them get the information and advice they need to make the best informed choices, which is why we always encourage both donors and patients to be treated at a licensed UK clinic. If arrangements are made outside of the clinic environment there can be medical and legal risks, for example, without the proper consents in place the donor is likely to be seen as the legal parent, with all the rights and responsibilities that involves. Clinics will also rigorously test all donors for medical and hereditary illnesses. That’s why we always encourage sperm donors and patients to go to a licensed clinic, where these medical and legal issues are taken care of for them, and where the welfare of the child is always of primary concern.  Mr Jones says heaposs been married since , but now lives apart from his we who he says is not at all happy about what he does.Back in , Mr Jones appeared in  Men  Babies, a Channel  documentary which follows the lives of four men who donate their sperm for free to women who contacted them online. A clip from the show was featured on Gogglebox, which has received more than four million views on Facebook. Of the  children he claims to have fathered, Mr Jones says heaposs met around  of the babies which are located within around a -mile radius of Derby, including in Birmingham, Stoke and Nottingham. After first making contact, Mr Jones says he then gets to know the couple, who are often same-sex or cannot have children of their own, and discuss when their ovulation cycle is. He said he then places the date on his planner, and when he gets the call saying ovulation is only hours away, he jumps into his van and drives close to where they live. Describing how he does it, Mr Jones previously told Derbyshire Live : I drive somewhere where Iaposm not likely to be disturbed and go into the back of the van and pull the curtains down. Then I take the cup and a syringe so the stuff canapost come out, put a bag under my arm and text them to say Iaposm outside and Iaposll be round in three minutes. If that doesnapost work sometimes they suggest I meet them in a car park. I can tell how nervous they are. No other donor does it from their van normally, they go to the front door and ask to use the toilet.

Shout - a text service for people struggling with their mental health - was Kate and Prince William’s first major project with Meghan and Prince Harry.It launched in May  following a £million investment from the Royal Foundation, when the royals were dubbed the Fab Four. However, today when visiting the service in Londonaposs Notting Hill, Kate was flying solo as she met volunteers and those who have raised funds for the organisation. Among them was a teenage Scout who raised £, for the service by sleeping outside in a hammock for a year. Kate met Leo Street, , and called him ‘an inspiration’ after he braved temperatures as low as minus five to raise money for the charity.The duchess, who wore a £ olive green Derek Lam dress and £ ASOS earrings, joked: “There really isn’t a big enough Scout badge for that. What you achieved is really inspiring.”“You must have had some impressive kit to keep warm,” she said.Leo, from Swanley, slept under a heavy-duty tarpaulin to shield him from the extremities of the weather.

He told the duchess his next fundraising adventure will be to cycle to Scotland during half term. Mark Ungless, , an analytics expert, said that children as young as  and under formed eight per cent of their texts – which are received mostly between pm and midnight “I told the duchess we were surprised by the number of very young people reaching out and the time too. It needs addressing,” he said. Kate’s visit to Shout was to mark the mental health text service reaching over one million text conversations with those in need and struggling to cope.Shout has seen usage on its  increase by  per cent since the start of the COVID- pandemic and Kate was hearing how it needs more volunteers to join to ensure it can meet growing demand.The duchess was also told that conversations taking place on the Shout can be used to provide insights on mental health in the UK, with suicide , depressionand anxiety or stress , being cited as the main reasons why texters have sought support. During the visit, Kate also viewed a live demonstration of the  before joining a small group of Shout Volunteers to hear about their experiences of helping those in distress. She was also shown how people have personally benefited from taking part in the service, including by gaining new skills and developing a sense of purpose and also met Cassie Waters who began raising money for Shout after using the service herself when she suffered mental health challenges in . During her visit, Kate also met clinical supervisors, volunteers, and fundraisers to thank them for their invaluable efforts to ensure that vital mental health support is available across the UK at any time of day or night. She heard how the service is inviting members of the public to become Shout Volunteers to meet the growing demand for support.

The politan Police had issued an arrest warrant for Leon McCaskre three weeks before he brutally killed Yasmin Chkai on the streets of Maida Vale, west London on Monday morning. As the -year-old repeatedly stabbed the mum-of-two with a kitchen kne, a -year-old motorist allegedly ploughed his car into the killer. Paramedics were unable to save either Yasmin, a qualied childminder and masters student, or McCaskre. Before her death, the mum-of-two had told friend Adele-Sara Richards that he had put cameras in her flat and had stolen her mail and phone in order to get her personal information. Ms Richard said that in April  she messaged her to say: Heaposs had cameras in my house recording me for months. She went on: Heaposs stolen my mail, my phone, has access to all my personal data. I think he will kill me. Iaposve tried everything. Family members, including two young men thought to be her  and -year-old sons, said that the -year-old had a panic alarm installed in her flat. They also accused Scotland Yard of doing nothing to help the mum, who they said took a restraining order out against McCaskre and orced him three years ago. Records show that McCaskre was wanted for failing to appear in court on January  after breaching stalking orders banning him from contacting Yasmin, The Times reports.  Deon Nelson-Wright, a close friend and former flatmate of the mum, said she knew the psychotic man spelt bad news for her pal from the moment they met. She told The Mirror: I knew this was going to happen. I just knew it. He was psychotic. A petition has been launched dubbing the unnamed driver a hero and calling for him not to face criminal charges. On Tuesday he was released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of murder. A friend told The Mirror that the driver, thought to be a dad-of-three, was in shock and living in a nightmare.

He says he was unable to eat for days after the apparent mix-up on January . He said after taking one bite into his double cheeseburger he found it was stuffed with bacon. The fast-food fan shared his ordeal on TikTok and says he has avoided bacon his entire le for religious reasons. However, other social media users have claimed that Burger Kingaposs cheeseburgers are not halal anyway. In a video, which has been viewed more than , times, Gundogdu told the burger chain to sort their staff out as he felt that his simple instructions were not followed.Gundogdu also reveals that he was left vomiting and suffering headaches and claims it has impacted his mental and physical health.The Stansted airport employee said he was shocked he was offered two free Whopper meals as an apology, after vowing to neverto Burger King again. Burger King has since apologised for the error and said they are retraining their team to aposminimiseapos mistakes like this. Gundogdu, from Enfield, Greater London, said: I was on my lunch break and I headed to Burger King to get a double cheeseburger. I specically say with all my meals aposno baconapos, and itaposs always been correct. I told this to the till lady a couple of times, and when I got my food, I didnapost expect otherwise.  It was a simple instruction. Itaposs a mistake and weaposre all human, but it wasnapost busy so they werenapost working under pressure so there wasnapost a reason for them to have made a mistake. Itaposs just down to basic instructions. Weaposre all human, we all make mistakes, I appreciate that. When I went to eat my burger, I took a bite and it didnapost taste right. I opened the bun and it was loaded with bacon. Even the smallest bite made me feel mentally and physically sick. For three days after, I wasnapost eating properly. I was physically hungry but I couldnapost eat without vomiting. I was feeling sick. The thought of the bacon made me feel sick. Even when Iaposd be chewing anything, I was automatically thinking it was bacon. The first day, I didnapost eat. By the third day, I was slowly getting back to eating. I was starving, but I physically and mentally couldnapost eat anything.  Itaposd been my plan that I was never going to eat it in my le. I didnapost know whether I was going to have an allergic reaction. Thataposs how important it was to me. I went back to the Burger King and complained, but they werenapost very helpful. They just apologised and that was it. Nothing , which really shocked me.Gundogdu decided that further action was required, and shared his experience on Twitter and TikTok.Gundogdu said: I took it to Twitter and posted pictures on there until Burger King got back to me. They apologised and gave me a link to email them. It took days for them to get back to my email complaint, and all they did was apologise and offer me two free Whopper meals. I thought they were taking the p*ss. Burger Kingaposs response really shocked me, that it was just an apology. I told them about my mental health and how I didnapost eat for three days.  I emailed back saying aposyouaposve not taken my mental health or religion into considerationapos. Nobodyaposs done anything regarding the situation. This has % put me off going back. Iaposll never go back to Burger King again. At the time of his visit, Gundogdu admits he didnapost realise that Burger King didnapost serve halal meat - meaning the meat is not considered permissible under Islamic law - but says he is not a strict Muslim. Gundogdu said: A lot of people on my TikTok were telling me that Burger King isnapost really halal, which I didnapost really know about. I thought any meat that wasnapost pork was halal. Iaposm Muslim but Iaposm not really religious. I donapost pray, so I donapost really know a lot about it. My biggest shock came from how much bacon was on there. Even my friends were shocked. All of my friends sympathised and % of my TikTok comments were sympathetic, which surprised me. Itaposs sad because it feels like nobody is taking this seriously. Several TikTok users empathised with Gundogduaposs predicament. One wrote: Eventhe burger isnapost halal itaposs the principle. Another commented: Eating bacon is so traumatising. Youaposre not overreacting, I suffered too. Itaposs just unbearable, and the disbelief too. Other commenters werenapost as sympathetic and chastised Gundogdu for eating at Burger King in the first place. In his video, which has been viewed over , times, Gundogdu says: I was on my break, so I went to Burger King Airside to get a burger meal. So I ordered a double cheeseburger meal and I specically said aposNo baconapos twice to the cashier. Got my meal and went back to my crew-room to eat it on my break. So I bit my burger, first bite. Iaposm chewing it, but Iaposm thinking aposThis does not taste right at allapos.  for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Open the bun and find itaposs loaded with, full of bacon, yeah. And Iaposm  years old. Iaposve never ever ever eaten bacon in my entire le, and Iaposm never planning on eating bacon. Itaposs just for like religious reasons, itaposs just not in my thing and Iaposve never eaten it and never will, so that needs to be appreciated and respected, I believe, in my f**king way. So here are the pictures now. So first, I want to show you this, on the wrapper of the burger, theyaposve specically crossed this out, so no bacon. Thataposs my first proof and thataposs the first mistake that theyaposve done. Anyway...Iaposve obviously finished my chips, this is the burger that Iaposve obviously had first bite of it. And then until I realise, I find this on my burger. How  How  Can someone like explain this to me  It just doesnapost make sense. I just do not understand. But I do want to say that Iaposve not been eating anything for the past three days. Iaposve been physically sick, Iaposve been vomiting, Iaposve been having headaches. Because Iaposve never ever eaten it in my entire le, and I was never planning on eating it. This is absolutely ridiculous. So I do want to give a big shout-out to Burger King,youaposre going to watch this, because you will be tagged in this. You need your staff out, you need to let them know that they need to listen to simple instructions that they have been given by customers really. A spokesperson for SSP, who operate Burger Kingaposs Stansted airport branch, said: Weaposre committed to providing passengers with a great experience at our restaurants, and we’re sorry to have fallen short on this occasion. In light of this incident, we will be retraining our team and making sure all customised orders are double checked before they are served to help ensure it doesn’t happen again. We have been in contact with the customer to apologise directly. A spokesperson for Burger King said: Burger King UK understands the impact and upset this incident has caused Gundogdu Yuzudik and sincerely apologises for this unfortunate human error. Staff are trained to follow customer specications to ensure they can have their meal their way and we will be reinforcing our training at all restaurants, to guarantee mistakes like this are minimised.

However, Morrisons has confirmed they will welcome maskless shoppers, BBC reports.The retailers said visitors wonapost be forced to wear masks, but they will be encouraged in order to keep staff and other people safe. Downing Street rolled out Plan B at the start of December to battle the surge of Omicron cases. The measures are being lted from tomorrow because the mutation has already peaked, the government has said. Though no longer a legal issue, the Government is still advising Brits to wear a mask in enclosed or crowded spaces, and when meeting strangers.  Retail worker trade union USDAW is also urging shoppers to observe Covid safety measures. Speaking to the broadcaster, Sainsburyaposs said safety was its highest priority. The supermarket plans to put up posters and remind customers over the tannoy about their guidance. In a statement, they said: In Scotland and Wales face coverings remain mandatory for those who can wear them in our stores, in line with the latest government restrictions.  We continue to have a range of safety measures in all of our stores, including screens and sanitising stations. Department store John Lewis, which owns Waitrose, will be suggesting people wear masks but say it will be down to iniduals to make a personal choice. Meanwhile, electronics store Currys will ask staff to wear masks in-store and while delivering products. But customers will not be expected to do so.  We will continue to assess our approach based on infection rates and colleague feedback, the company said. Usdaw, which represents , retail workers, said the Governmentaposs move to end the measure was deeply disappointing while infections rates remain high. General secretary Paddy Lillis said: We hope all retailers will continue to put staff and customer safety first. Wearing a face covering is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with the public. Rail operators also plan to ask travellers to adhere to mask-wearing rules on their services.  Boris Johnson confirmed all Plan B measures will end tomorrow. This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country. UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.This means that the end of Plan B does not mean the end of restrictions altogether.

And she applauds the St Albans headteacher who is ripping up the rulebookEva Simpson says schools should scrap their hair rulesImage: Getty ImagesopinionByEva Simpson:,  Jan | comments Like most parents on their child’s first day of ­ secondary school, I was filled with immense pride.My son looked so smart in his new unorm – blazer, tie, shirt, gleaming shoes. I took loads of pictures to show family and friends.When we arrived at the school, a teacher pointed to my son and called out “can this boy’s parent come and see me I stepped forward proudly. I didn’t expect to be singled out for how well turned out and smart my son looked on his first day of big school. “Good morning,” said the teacher. “I’m just wonderingyou read the school’s policy on hair  Your son’s haircut is in contravention of that.” I was stunned. Contravention. What was he on about My son had a perfectly normal hair cut, one that he’d had all through primary school. A short crop, similar to one sported by US President Barack Obama. But as far as the school was concerned it was an “extreme” haircut because it wasn’t a number four or above. In other words it was too short. I won’t lie, I was so upset I was on the verge of tears. Of course in typical British fashion I apologised profusely and assured him it wouldn’t happen again. But I was fuming. It immediately created a ­ision when there didn’t need to be one and left a very bad taste. There have been too many incidents of black children being penalised for hair ­“transgressions”. So I was heartened to read about St Albans headteacher Julie Richardson who has ripped up the school’s rule book on hair and thrown it out of the window.Now kids can come in with cornrows, Afros, short hair, whatever, without being put into isolation and missing valuable teaching time.Too many unorm policies around hair are ridiculous. They ignore children’s cultural heritage. Black schoolgirls for instance have sometimes been banned from having braids as they’re classed as hair extensions, even though they’re neat and mean the child can get ready for school much quicker. This fosters resentment, all to the detriment of the child. Part of the problem is the lack of ­ersity among school governors. It’s a closed shop. Many schools, especially those with a large black student body, have practically no black representation among the governing body and that needs to change. So I applaud Ms Richardson. I hope more schools take a leaf out of her book.

They came across a lion cub called Christian in the pet department of Harrods department store and bought the animalJohn Rendall and Anthony Bourke with Christian the lion in their London home Image: SHARED CONTENT UNITByDeborah Collcutt:,  Jan | commentsThe trio were as common a sight in seventies Cha as mini-skirts and Mary Quant eyeliner, driving around in a convertible Mercedes, dining in the finest restaurants and partying with glamorous women. And one of them was a lion. Christian the lion cub was famous among the bohemian and glamorous social world which congregated in that trendy part of south west London and included The Beatles, Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix and Vivienne Westwood, as well as his owners Anthony ‘Ace’ Bourke and John Rendall, whose death at the age of  was announced today. The Lion Man of Cha, as Rendall came to be known, and Bourke were flatmates who ran a furniture store, coincidentally called Sophistocat. They came across Christian in the pet department of Harrods department store, where back in the day you could buy tapirs, snakes, monkeys, pumas and even lions as well. This was before the Endangered Species Act of , which made it illegal for exotic creatures to be sold to the public. For the princely sum of  guineas – about £, in today’s money – Christian was theirs.  The men set about feeding Christian from a detailed diet sheet supplied by Harrods: raw egg and vitamins for breakfast, raw meat — usually chopped beef or rabbit — for lunch and supper, and, as a special treat, a delicious marrow-filled bone at night. Local restaurants and butchers offered steaks that were past their sell-by date, and cut-price meat. But exercise soon became a concern as Rendall and Bourke didn’t know where to walk him in this densely populated and traffic-choked corner of London. The local vicar came to their rescue when he offered Christian the use of a churchyard, near the shop. When he was nearly a year old, Christian had grown rapidly and his owners heartbreakingly decided they had to set him free. Lion expert George Adamson agreed to rehome him at Kora reserve in Kenya, so two weeks after Christian’s first and last birthday in England in August, , they headed for Africa. When they took Christian for his first walk in the bush, they witnessed the animal instincts that would ensure his survival. Spotting a lost cow in the bush, Christian instantly froze and began stalking his prey, stealthily creeping forwards. George was worried about the cow’s horns and told the men to grab Christian.  For the first time ever, the lion turned and snarled at them, leaving the pair profoundly shaken by the transformation in Christian from a biddable pet to a deadly hunter. Although sad that it was time to say goodbye, the pair were relieved to see he possessed the instincts he needed to stay alive. “Once we’d got him to Africa, I think Ace particularly had a real sense of, ‘my God, we’ve done it. Phew’.” said John years later. “But it was also sad: this wonderful presence had gone.” A year later, in the summer of , the men ed to Kora to see George and, they hoped, Christian. George warned them not to get their hopes up as Christian, now the head of a small pride, hadn’t been seen for weeks. But when they landed in Nairobi, George was beaming. “The lions turned up this morning,” he said. “Christian must have known you were coming.” The moment he heard his former owners’ voices, Christian ran towards them, grunting with excitement. Watching the lb lion bounding towards them at about  miles an hour was a breathtaking moment – would he greet or attack them  Bracing themselves, suddenly Christian was jumping up, rubbing their heads, and running backwards and forwards between them as he tried to embrace both men at the same time. He knew exactly who they were. The wonderful moment of reunion was captured on film and has since been watched more than  million views on YouTube. “I look at the photos of that meeting and realise how overwhelmed I was by the powerful emotion,” Rendall said in an interview. “At that moment, the gulf between humans and lions had been blurred by sheer euphoria.” Rendall, who was found dead in his study on Sunday by his magician son, Max, said in an interview once: “Christian changed my le forever and I will never forget him.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Daily MirrorLions,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The condition means that the ligaments in Allesha’s spine are tense and tighter than usual, subsequently pulling her brain into her spinal canal which causes crippling headaches making sound and light unbearable for the teen.The potentially fatal condition can also lead to ‘internal decapitation’ or paralysis when the tension builds so much that these ligaments become severed. The former law student, whose dreams of becoming a lawyer were initially dashed by the devastating diagnosis, needed £, to fly to Spain and have an innovative new operation which will stop the malformation in her spine. Have you got an incredible story to tell  Email webnews@mirror But following an exclusive Mirror appeal to help her raise the funds she has received an incredible £, from people around the world. Allesha said: “The surgery is booked, all I need to book now is my flights and work out who is going to come with me. “I’m literally so happy it’s unreal, I can’t believe it. “The Mirror is the reason this has all happened, I donapost know where I would be without all these amazing people who have donated and the help I have had to raise awareness.  “Thousands of people have donated, some of them I’ve never met. “I rang my sister crying when we hit £,. I’ve had to take the last few days just to process it. “I never thought I would even manage to raise the money I needed, never mind do it in a few days.” Allesha had started looking for answers three years ago when she was struck down with daily headaches so severe that she can’t bear to look at light or hear anything louder than a whisper. The teenager was forced to give up her placement with a law firm and quit college just as she was about to go to university, instead spending her le confined in a dark quiet room.  Now her surgery at the Filum System clinic in Barcelona is booked for February  and Allesha will be supported by her boyfriend, Kieran, . Although the recovery period ies between patients, Allesha hopes to be home and healthy in time for her th birthday in April, when her le can finally begin again.

The latest figures mark an increase on the number of cases recorded this time last week, and mark a reversal on the downwards trend seen in infections following the New Year period.In recent days the number of new cases has hovered around the , mark after peaking at nearly , new cases in early January.Case numbers have substantially dropped since peaking around New Year’s - with , cases recorded on January . However, the lag between catching Covid and falling ill, and then falling seriously ill and dying, means death rates are spiking now. The UK recorded , cases yesterday and have once again increased today, suggesting the decline in cases has been brought to a halt.  The  deaths recorded over the  hours to Tuesday pm marked the highest number of deaths confirmed in one day since February  last year. New data suggests the Omicron strain caused unprecedented levels of coronavirus infection in England this month with the new iety almost completely replacing Delta.The highest prevalence was seen in primary school children at .%, while overall it was .% between January  and  this year. It means that during this period one in  people in England was infected with Covid. The latest figures come just hours before Covid Plan B measures are due to be axed in England tomorrow. This means that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops, work-from-home guidance and the need for Covid passes will all be axed, despite rates of Omicron infection still surging across the country.UK will revert to Plan A with a focus on vaccine rollout, with Health Secretary Sajid Javid warning last Wednesday that itaposs not the end of the road eventhe number of cases are falling.Work-from-home guidance ended last week, with people ing to offices almost immediately after it was axed. Similarly, face coverings are no longer a legal requirement in public spaces including transport and shops. Face masks will also no longer be required in classrooms. The scrapping of Covid tests required for travellers reentering the UK also signals the continuation of efforts to learn to live with Covid. The elimination of the tests, no longer needed from February , also led to a boom in bookings for people keen to escape for the February half-term of Easter break.Meanwhile the country is awaiting the publication of Sue Gray’s report into the ious Downing Street parties - which it’s thought could lead to the end of Boris Johnson’s leadership. The Met police yesterday confirmed they were investigating the number of potentially law-breaking ‘events’ thrown by No. throughout the pandemic.One of these ‘events’ was reportedly a surprise birthday party thrown for Boris Johnson which involved cake.Despite originally resisting calls to investigate any of the  reported parties which were thrown at ious stages during lockdown, Cressida Dick has confirmed that the police would look into the claims. The report by top civil servant Sue Gray has looked into the same events.

Iaposm not happy, I felt disappointed. I thought I might fancy a Subway so went to seethey had any offers in the leaflet. I turned it over and to my dismay I felt they were making a mockery of Veganuary, Jamie, from Norwich, said. Iaposve never seen any company, let alone such a big one, make a mockery of Veganuary. They include so many meats like aposSteakuaryapos or aposTurkeybreastuary, it was just a marketing opportunity for them  Iaposd rather they just promoted Veganuary, it was unnecessary to add all the other terms. This should be a time of promoting a more ethical option. I was just pretty dumbfounded. Iaposve never seen any other wording like that. Iaposll happily boycott them now.The -year-old, who has been a vegan for two years and was previously vegetarian for  years, took to Facebook to vent about the absolute p***take pamphlet to his followers, who branded it pathetic and f***ing vile.Subway UK  Ireland very disappointed with you making a mockery of Veganuary, he wrote.

Now the animal rights activist has vowed to boycott Subway despite having at least  within walking distance of his home as he feels the chain have undone their efforts to support plant-based eating. Jamie said: This is a month where it should really be hitting home that thereaposs other tasty options. I posted it online to seeanyone  had the same feelings as me, and an awful lot of people do. That was the first time Iaposve ever addressed a big company directly and Iaposve still not had a response from them. Itaposs a leaflet with six vouchers inside - only one of which is for their plant-based section. The rest apply to any of their meat or dairy products. Other than the post, people have been contacting me [privately]. The general consensus is that people arenapost happy. I do generally speak to like-minded people and they think itaposs degrading to the cause. I thought [Subway] had made a step in the right direction by bringing out plant-based options and theyaposve done a  now. Itaposs like theyaposve undone their efforts so far. After posting online, Jamie received a number of responses from unamused followers who agreed it wasnapost the best move for the sandwich chain. Pathetic. Wouldnapost go there anyway, one wrote, while another added: F***ing vile to use the Veganuary word and [to] add flesh aposfleshanuaryapos it is literally taking the p***. I’m pleased I’m no regular at this place. This poster is not funny, a third wrote, while a fourth commented: They can stuff it! Iaposll make my own rolls and a lot cheaper too.

But moving from Kent to Cheshire meant she also had to say a heartbreaking goodbye to her dog Jak, who had been a gt from Roy  years ago. The -year-old left the Bichon-Lakeland terrier mix with a relative who lived more than  miles away, which meant she didnapost get to see him very often. After hearing the story, staff at her care home hatched a plan to find him a local home so she would still get to see him. And before long employee Claire Dunnettaposs sister, Sarah Roberts, came to the rescue and adopted him - and Diana and Jak have now been reunited.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Diana had the surprise of her le when she was told by staff at Redwalls Nursing Home, Sandiway, Cheshire, that they had found Jak a home nearby. Now with Jak being so close, he is able to pop in and see Diana every few days. Diana, retired hotel owner, said: I couldnapost believe it. Itaposs a miracle. Jak leapt up at me from the door and jumped on me and we had cuddles and kisses. Itaposs just like old times.  Regional activities coordinator Jodie Solaiman, , and relatives had seen how distraught Diana was at being so far away from her -year-old dog and put out a plea to rehome him somewhere local. Luckily local Sarah Roberts jumped at the chance to make a dference and travelled to pick him up from Kent the next day. Sarah said: As soon as I heard about Jodie looking to home Jak closer to Diana I just thought, aposIaposll have him. Iaposm local so I can pop to Redwalls any time and the dference it will make to Diana is immeasurable!apos So much so, my children and I travelled to Kent the next day to collect Jak and the reunion was so happy and emotional that I knew I had made the right decision. Diana was very surprised when she found out the news. When I told Diana that weaposd found Jak a home just five minutes away she couldnapost believe it, Jodie said. She was in tears with happiness. Jodie also managed to capture the moment the pair were reunited for the first time in over a year. An excited Jak jumps up onto Dianaaposs lamp straight away after seeing her.

Speaking in a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry said deals with the streaming giants were never part of the plan, but said they needed cash to pay for security. He said: That was suggested by somebody  by the point of where my family literally cut me off financially, and I had to afford security for us. Upcoming shows  Although no programmes have made it to screens, details of several shows Harry and Meghan have been working on have been released.In April , it was revealed a documentary called Heart of Invictus was in the works - with Harry saying he couldnapost be more excited for it. The series will focus on injured or ill service members around the globe preparing for the  Invictus Games at The Hague, The Netherlands. The episodes will chart the journey of the competitors as they train up, the organisers as they set to work making the planned games a reality, and also the national teams working with both sides for the delayed games in the Spring.Meanwhile, last July, it was announced Meghan would be acting as an executive producer on an animated series about a young girlaposs adventures.It has the working title Pearl and the young character will be inspired by a iety of influential women from throughout history. Other executive producers include Elton Johnaposs husband David Furnish, Carolyn Soper, and Emmy Award-winning filmmakers Liz Garbus and Dan Cogan. No air date has been given for the show. Fly-on-the-wall documentary   When Harry and Meghanaposs Netflix deal was announced, it was speculated that the pair could feature in their own fly-on-the-wall-style documentary.However, this was swtly denied by the Sussexes, with their spokesperson telling Hello:The Duke and Duchess are not taking part in any reality shows. But last September, it was reported that Harry was spotted with a mic during his and Meghanaposs tour of New York.The black wire could be seen sticking out his trouser pocket and into his shirt and it has been suggested the couple may have been recording content for their Netflix deal. Hiring help Now it appears that Netflix is on the look out for a Los Angeles-based production designer to work on the Pearl project.According to MailOnline, the job ad posted on social media states the person will help to develop, create and support the aesthetic vision of the executive producer team.The job ad also states: The ideal candidate will need to be someone who can collaborate with grace, humility, inclusion and open-mindedness.

The treatment of the disease damaged her pituitary gland, leaving it nearly inactive, so now she stands at just ft, even though she is the age of a fully-grown woman. Sheaposs now spoken out saying how upsetting le can be, as people judge her for not dressing like a child or for wearing make up, and they even approach her mother and criticise her parenting. What do you think of Shaunaaposs bravey  Let us know in the comments...Shauna is starring in a TLC documentary called I Am Shauna Rae, and in the showaposs advert, she said: If you were to look at me, you would think Iaposm just a normal little girl, doing normal little girl things with my fun, crazy family. But the truth is Iaposm not a little girl. Iaposm a woman, a -year-old woman stuck in the body of an eight-year-old.The channel also shared a clip from the show on TikTok, @tlctv, which includes an interview with Shauna and her mum, Patty Schrankel.  Patty said: Shauna likes to dress up, like any other -year-old, but we go out together and she gets looks like aposoh wow, what is she doing  What is that kid doing apos Then I get the looks of aposhow could you  How could you let your child dress like this  And the negative comments have an impact on Shauna, even though theyaposre not directed at her. Shauna said: My mum has to explain that Iaposm old enough to make my own decisions, but they donapost believe her - they call her a liar. So thataposs not fun. I feel horrible for my mum because I donapost deal with all the backlash, they donapost think itaposs appropriate to come up to a child and say these things - they think itaposs appropriate to come up to the mother which isnapost appropriate at all, in my opinion.

Cameron Newsom, , first developed a white spot on her tongue and was referred by her dentist to the local hospital for a biopsy. The spot was not painful and, when the results came back negative for any signs of cancer, she and her husband Anthony, also , and their son Hudson, , were told not to worry.But a year later, Cameron, from Colorado Springs, Colorado, developed another identical spot and was admitted to hospital again for a deeper, more invasive biopsy, Bristol Live reports. The results once again showed no signs of cancer but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots.  Months later, her tongue became sensitive and sore, and immediately contacted her dentist. She was given antibiotics to combat any potential infection but her condition continued to worsen, as the original spots had transformed into a pinkish tumour on the left side of her tongue. She was sent for further tests and a third biopsy and after being referred to an ear nose and throat specialist, Cameron was diagnosed with stage four squamous cell carcinoma – skin cancer of the tongue. Cameron said: At the time of my diagnosis Iaposd lost over seven pounds because I was unable to eat or drink. It took three years from when the first spot originally appeared for doctors to finally diagnose me - no one ever mentioned it could be oral cancer. When I was told, it seemed like I was being handed a death sentence there and then, but straight away my reaction was Iaposm ready to fight this. I was  at the time and in very good shape, so I couldnapost understand why this was happening to me.  When I got home that day I googled my type of cancer and as you can imagine the results were absolutely terrying. There were images of people after having their jaws removed or sawed in half - Iaposd never been so scared. Cameronaposs diagnosis came in May  and she was scheduled in for three rounds of chemo, starting in July and finishing in September that year. Throughout that time, she was unable to eat or drink anything without suffering excruciating pain - all whilst undergoing grueling cancer treatment. There would be times at the dinner table where I would just burst into tears because I couldnapost eat a thing, she said.results showed no signs of cancer - but medical experts couldnapost identy the cause of the spots. Hudson, who was five at the time, didnapost know why I was always so upset and it got to the point where I couldnapost physically speak to him or my husband. A low point for me was when I went to a party with all my closest friends and I had to leave because my mouth was in so much pain. I went home and took a shower to calm down, and thataposs when clumps of my hair started falling out - it was so upsetting. Thankfully for Cameron, her chemotherapy was successful and as a result the tumor had shrunk a considerable amount. Her body had reacted well to the treatment, but the next part of her recovery was to have the tumor completely removed. She then flew back and forth to the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas to meet with some of the best oral surgeons in the country and organise the operation. On December , Cameron went under the kne, and oral and plastic surgeons worked together to remove the left side of her tongue. In what was a nine-and-a-half hour operation, they then replaced that part of her tongue with skin and muscle tissue from her thigh. Surgeons then performed a Tracheotomy on Cameron, where they sliced a hole between her two collar bones and inserted a tube into her neck so she could breathe. The mum also had a feeding tube taped to her nose so she could ingest vital calories which were desperately needed to help her body recover. Read More Cameron said: They usually take skin from your forearm, but I’m only five foot two, so I didn’t have enough skin on my forearm to replace what I was having removed. However, Iaposve been an athlete all my le, and there was plenty for them to use from my thigh - so thataposs what we decided to do. The oral surgeon removed part of my tongue, and the plastic surgeon took muscle and skin from my thigh to replace it. When I woke up I had tubes coming out my neck and nose which allowed me to breathe and eat. The next few weeks were hell because my mouth was so swollen I couldnapost swallow or breathe unassisted. I had to be under constant observation and every time my throat had a build up of blood and body fluid, it had to be flushed away using water. That was basically like being waterboarded by the nurses once or twice a day which was absolutely horric. The weirdest part of the whole experience was when I felt a rough texture on the thigh part of my tongue - and when I looked in the mirror it had started growing leg hair! For nine weeks after her surgery, Cameron underwent  rounds of radiation and another three rounds of chemo to rid of any remaining cancer cells. In that time she was unable to speak, and for six months had to use a tube inserted in her stomach to eat and drink whilst her wounds healed. From then on, Cameron started getting used to le with her new tongue - which included relearning how to speak, chew, drink and swallow. I had to teach myself how to speak again after the radiation therapy which was a really bizarre feeling, she said. I can only taste on the right side of my tongue which is the real side, and only chew on the right side because the left is attached to my gums. My manners are terrible because food sometimes just falls out my mouth, and when food gets stuck underneath my tongue it feels like having a small rock in your shoe. Because the left side is sewn to my gums I donapost have the full range of motion I used to which can be frustrating. A feeling I could compare it to is like having a dead arm or dead leg all the time - it is constantly tingly and numb. Only the healthy side produces saliva and I cant stick my tongue out my mouth at all, so licking things is a big no no! Itaposs now been nine years since my diagnosis and thereaposs been no signs of regression. The longer you go without regressing the less likely it is the cancer will come back, so were all feeling really positive.  was the toughest year of my le and I couldnapost of done it without the support of my amazing Antony and the rest of my family. In June , once she proved she could eat and drink unaided, Cameron ed to her job as a gymnastics coach and was finally able to start living le again. She has since mentored several other people whoaposve been diagnosed with the same cancer as she was, offering them support and guidance throughout their treatment.

After the vehicle ran into trouble, some of the crates broke after spilling out and it allowed many of the caged monkeys to run free. She approached one before it hissed at her and the woman from Pennsylvania, US, says she’s been experiencing ‘pink eye’ symptoms since the incident last week. She was also reported an inflammation of the eyeball and a cough and believes she may have caught something following the road accident.  Now Mrs Fallon has begun a course of antiviral drugs and treatment to prevent rabies. Following the rescue mission, she became alarmed after hearing officials warn the public not to approach the escaped monkeys as they could be carrying infectious diseases. She told news outlet WBRE: “I thought I was just doing the right thing by helping. “I was close to the monkeys, I touched the crates, I walked through their faeces so I was very close. So I called to inquire, you know, was I safe ”  Since the incident, the animal lover says she has experienced a number of symptoms.She wrote on Facebook : “What a day! I tried to help out at an accident and was told there were cats in the crates. So I went over to pet them only to find out it was monkeys.Then I noticed that there was three in each, with some completely broken, so I knew four had got away.  “I came home to go to bed and my aunt ran into a news crew and she found out not to get too close to the monkey. Well, I tried to pet one. I touched the crates and walked in poop. I was told meet the police at the scene to talk about exposure. “I spoke with the police and a woman from the CDC. I am getting a letter and Iaposm very low risk for I donapost know what yet. But my symptoms are covid symptoms. Like seriously. A day from hell!” Mrs Fallon visited a hospital where she was told by medics to closely monitor her health for the next month in case she develops any infectious diseases. The monkeys that managed to escape and go on the run were later captured and euthanised.

Andrew Pougnet and his we Sabrina Pougnet, both  from Ontario, Canada, moved into their home in June  and discovered the pool that hadnapost been used for around two decades. It was covered with decking and during that time, it had slowly filled with debris and rainwater, causing it to develop its own ecosystem at the bottom, like a lake. We started renovations on the home the day we got the keys, Sabrina said. We finished almost the entire main floor before working up the courage to tackle the in-ground pool this past summer.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. We had learned from the original owner when we bought the home that it would take a lot of work to get the pool up and running and ultimately restore it to its previous glory days. The couple were told by neighbours that it had been around  years since the pool had last been in use, which made them consider getting some extra help. Sabrina said: Initially we had reached out to local pool companies to seewe could hire someone to restore it for us, as neither of us had any experience, but our emails went unanswered likely due to the high demand for pools due to covid. Andrew and I didn’t knowthe pool structure would even be salvageable until the deck was removed - as it sat for so many years collecting rainwater and debris with a damaged liner. Finally, we decided to try restoring it ourselves and share the process as a series on our TikTok account. After Andrew, who works as a carpenter, and Sabrina, who is a recreation therapist, removed the deck, the couple could immediately see the rust on the walls they had feared. She added: We were worried that the pool may be too damaged to try restoring,that was the case, it was about to be the shortest TikTok series ever! Luckily for us, after draining the water and cleaning out the debris, we could see that the pool structure was salvageable, aside from minor surface rust which Andrew removed to prepare for a new liner. We knew it was going to be full of water and that there was a good chance of many dead critters and debris. However, we were surprised by the lack of smell, you would think that having a swamp of a pool for so many years, the smell would be unbearable, but it really didn’t smell at all! Even after draining the water to expose the ecosystem at the bottom of the pool, the smell was comparable to that of seaweed at a beach - a little fishy but not that bad.

Sharing her story anonymously on Mumsnet, the woman explained her friend is also currently pregnant and when her announcement was made, she splashed out on flowers and apregnancy hamper and began calling her every day to see how she was getting on.When the mum then fell pregnant a few months after her friend, she expected her tothe favour and be just as excited for her - but so far, she has been consciously not celebrating the womanaposs pregnancy news. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: My best friend found out she was pregnant last Autumn after trying for a year. I was so thrilled for her, I sent flowers the day after she told me the news, made her a pregnancy hamper, showered her with love, and checked in on her every day to see how she was getting on. I askedsheaposd be happy for me to think about baby showers for her when sheaposs further along and started sharing ideas with her. Once my friend conceived I told her that I wanted to start trying and she was very supportive. She knew I was holding off for her to get pregnant, as I already have a toddler who I conceived straight away so thought it could possibly happen again. She was fine up until I conceived in the first cycle and told her I was due two months after her. She seemed in shock that I was pregnant and I think some of it could be that it was so quick for us in comparison to her journey. The mum said she feels disappointed that her friend hasnapost made any effort to check in on her, and said that while she would usually make a big deal out of important events, she seems uninterested in her pregnancy.  She added: A few months on, despite me still checking in on her almost every day, she doesnapost ask how Iaposm doing orany of the love and support I give her. I donapost expect gts like the ones I gave her, but as an example, weaposre planning a meal out as a big group and I askedshe had any cravings or aversions so we could decide around that, but she didnapost ask about me. Sheaposs the type of person who would normally make a big deal about this , so feels like sheaposs consciously not celebrating my pregnancy. This is my best friend of  years so I was expecting her to be excited weaposd be on Mat leave together and experience this together. But commenters on the Mumsnet post were baffled by the mum, as many of them said she was being over the top and putting too much pressure on her friend - especially when sheaposs also going through her own pregnancy journey. One person wrote: You are very over the top. It would make me very uncomfortablemy friends reacted like that to a pregnancy announcement. While another said: I think your friend is probably feeling somewhat smothered, and maybe you should back off a bit. Sheaposs probably fine, and thinks you are too. And a third added: As lovely as your intentions are, it all sounds a bit suffocating to me personally. Also, it sounds like this is your friendaposs first pregnancy and your second one  So youaposve been through all this before, why do you need special handholding the second time around  I understand wanting a bit of support, but it all just sounds a bit intense and needy.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PregnancyUmm what Parenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite it being traditional for wives and children to take on the manaposs last name, the mum-to-be decided against this when she married her hubby three years ago.At the time, however, they came to an agreement that any future children would take on his name, to appease his traditional family - but with their first child on the way, the woman has now grown to regret her decision.When I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already discussed this and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum.But recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husbandaposs family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and in-laws are ridiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it.  The woman went home and told her husband sheaposd changed her mind about their childaposs last name, and had decided she wanted their son to have their surnames combined, or she would be changing his name to hers. He was confused saying we had an agreement and then asked what was the cause of this sudden change of mind. I told him and he said I canapost just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that Iaposm the mother I get a say too, she continued. We went back and forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son, asmy last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just aposdealapos with it now but I wonapost accept it. The woman then turned to Reddit to question whether others also agreed with her husband, or whether they thought she too made a valid point. You literally mention that you’ve had this promise at least since you were married and have both discussed and agreed! He is right to be upset knowing you have already agreed and it’s a big deal to his family, which you are aware of, one Reddit user commented. It must be out of nowhere for him, yes you are the we and future mum but that doesn’t mean you can just switch sides and go back on your word whenever you feel like it. Meanwhile another added: Hyphenated is a reasonable compromise, but you’re still an a**hole for agreeing to give them his name and going back on it now that it’s time to follow through on your word.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Water from the lake’s waves has recently landed on his next-door neighbour’s lamp post, thus creating the two menacing aposvisitorsapos Ben has since nicknamed Jack Frost and Grim Reaper. However, in a further unsettling twist to the tale, after Ben showed his daughter the photographs, she recognised the looming figures as being “spirits” that she believes have been visiting her in her dreams. Ben continued: “My youngest daughter had previously told us that she would have nightmares when sleeping in her lakeside bedroom in the old cottage – such that sheaposd sleep on the couch at times. When I showed her the pics of the ice formations she was stunned. She told me that the dejected-looking figure with head bowed was the image she had been tormented by in her dreams.

Nato is bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea regionRussian President Vladimir Putin Image: Alexei Nikolsky TASSByChris HughesDefence and Security Editor:,  Jan | commentsRussian air force chiefs sparked an attack scare by planting war plane transponders on military vehicles, it was claimed tonight. The ruse looked like  military planes grouping up and moving in circles at west Russian airports close to the Ukraine border.If it was a “spoof manoeuvre” security experts suspect it was to hide another “activity” happening where and keep NATO guessing. British Rivet Joint spy planes are known to have been flying patrols over Ukraine to hoover up Russian radio chatter and other communications. They are there to provide an early warning of where and when an attack might be launched by Russian forces moving into Ukraine.  Alarmingly Moscow’s air force planes have been steadily increasing in number in airports to the west of Russia without being involved in exercises. Around , Russian combat troops are gathered close to the Ukraine border, along with , pro-Moscow separatists in contested Donbas. Russia also has a large number of regular and special forces bolstering Donbas separatists, although Moscow has repeatedly denied this. An expert in Russian military matters told the Daily Mirror: “I havenapost seen anything like this before. Air force people in the UK are baffled.  “Circuiting round and round and up and down a large airfield is not a recognised manoeuvre. “These aircraft could be seen moving all day, burning fuel. “So it was likely a spoof with jeeps or cars meandering around with transponders on them. “This could mean not that nothing is happening, but something is happening where that we cannot detect.  Russia has warned it would quickly take retaliatory measuresthe US and its allies reject its security demands regarding NATO membership. Russia has demanded guarantees that Nato will never admit Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as members and that the alliance will roll back troop deployments in ex-Soviet bloc countries. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said he and other top officials would advise President Vladimir Putin on the next steps after receiving written replies from the US to the demands. He said: If the West continues its aggressive course, Moscow will take the necessary retaliatory measures. Nato is bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region and the US ordered , troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe. Western nations including the UK have also sent plane loads of weapons to help Ukraine strengthen its defences.

The close ally of Vladimir Putin told senators that Russia should examine imposing chemical castration routinely for men convicted of child sex offences, a punishment used in neighbouring Kazakhstan. Her deputy Andrei Turchak intervened and said: “Iaposd suggest physical [castration].” Matviyenko, , said Russia should further toughen its laws and called for looking at castration as a punishment and “study the experience of other states”. But the priority was to jail child sex attackers, she said. Turchak won applause from senators when he said le sentences should be imposed on first-time paedophile offenders. The new laws which apply to cases when the victims are under  follow a spate of cases which have received big publicity in the Russian media. An attack this month saw “a convicted paedophile and his male lover” snatch a girl, five from a snowy street.  The child was subsequently raped and then killed, say reports citing law enforcement. She had been stabbed multiple times and her body hidden in a duffle bag. When the suspects were later detained, they needed police protection to stop a lynching by furious locals. The child, Veronika Nikolayeva, had been playing near the cinema and cultural complex where her mother works in Kostroma. One of the suspects was named as Denis Gerasimov, , earlier jailed for paedophile offences including producing child pornography. He was released from jail in March last year, after serving four-and-a-half years for convictions which included sex with an underage girl. The other suspect, Vadim Belyakov, , reportedly has a conviction for theft. The case led to politicians vowing to rush new laws through parliament.

The -year-old reportedly posted a clip of bringing a bear into her flat in Mytishchi in the Russian area of Moscow Oblast on TikTok. She lives in the flat with her one-year-old Mark, sparking concerns from her neighbours. Tatarintseva filmed the moment the bear was brought home with the help of a man. In the clip, she appears very excited and wonders what her sonaposs reaction will be. Local news reports she ordered the bear for her son. Tatarintseva also filmed another video of her playing and singing with the bear in her flat and shared it with her followers. In one scene, she appears to be standing behind the beast and dancing. The bear is wearing a collar and has a leash attached to it. The son is not seen in the video, but the influencer is seen stroking the beast in the clips. Tatarintsevaaposs neighbours, who were aware of the incident after the videos went viral, called it unacceptable. An unnamed neighbour said: The neighbours showed me a video of a huge bear being brought into our apartment building. This crosses all sorts of boundaries. This is a wild animal, it does not belong in an apartment building. And whatit had encountered children or pets in the hallway  It was kept on a lead with only one person accompanying it. If the animal had felt provoked by something, it could have led to terrible consequences. The videos, which have since been taken down, also caught the attention of the local authorities. The Public Prosecutoraposs Office of Moscow Oblast confirmed that law enforcement agencies have launched an investigation. The investigation will centre around allegations of animal mistreatment and child endangerment, local news reported.

Lucy Anne, from New Jersey, US, first realised her desire to revert back to infancy at the age of nine but only began acting like a baby aged . The cyber-security analyst spends her time at home lounging around in nappies, onesies and dummies while also selling pictures of herself dressed as a baby online. Despite this, Lucy claims she does not dress up as a baby for sexual reasons, but for comfort and acceptance after years of resenting how she felt. She said: “These feelings and desire to revert to a baby-like state started when I was really young. “I didn’t understand them at the time and I grew up hating how I felt. “As a teen, I experimented by wearing diapers and started to explore the ‘adult baby diaper lover’community after thinking about it for over ten years.  Lucy said she became involved with the ABDL community with an ex-partner, who was also part of it, and has since worn onesies and nappies to relax at home.She added: “I opened an Instagram to share my images because I feel cute and will sometimes get direct messages where people will ask me for specic photos or will just send me money because they like my content.“I’ve made £ from commissions but I’ve probably made more from people who have sent me money to buy new stuffed animals, paciers or diapers. “I actually have one contributor who actually sends me £ of adult diapers each month.” Lucy’s acting age range is between three and five years old and she tries to immerse herself in the experience as much as possible. She said: “I really want the experience of being a baby to be as realistic as possible and knew I couldn’t just do that with a diaper. “I use the diapers for the reason they are intended for and find that it actually helps me sleep through the night without being disturbed by weak bladder issues. “I sometimes will wear a diaper to work, hidden under everyday work clothes. “I have a collection of paciers, pyjama onesies that have a flap on the bottom for easy access and lots of cute fleece blankets. “Stuffed toys also make up a big part of my baby collection, and I also have a few cat ears to match. Due to her interests and desire to revert back to a baby, Lucy often gets requests she is uncomfortable with as well as struggling to reveal her lestyle to some family members and friends. She said: “As I’ve never seen this as a sexual thing, when I get sexual requests, I am quite uncomfortable and will always try and ignore it. “One of the grossest requests askedI could dry hump one of my stuffed animals on a video call, so they were blocked immediately. “When my mum found out, it took her a while to understand it, but she came around when she realised I was doing it in private and not causing any harm. “A few of my friends think it’s a bit weird but know that it’s just a part of who I am. “I’ve always wanted to reveal myself to my dad and other family members, but I’m not sure they’d understand.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsOnesiesGiant babies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chandra Morton, , from Johnson City, Tennessee, claims she is lucky to still have her top lip after filler was accidentally injected into an artery in her face. The US waitress says her face changed colour and white blisters began to appear due to vascular occlusion - which happens when circulation of oxygen is blocked from the area. She claims she has lost a small chunk of her top lip but says she is grateful the doctor eventually manage to fix the issue before she lost more of her lip to necrosis. Chandra added: I wanted to get lip fillers because I had always felt insecure about my top lip. So many people have had their lips done and I thought it would be fine. I was looking forward to having fuller lips. However as soon as I had the procedure done, my lips felt so numb and started turning white. Eventually the colour of my face changed and more and more white blisters kept appearing. I was absolutely terried and I was in so much pain. I was told thatI waited a day longer I would have lost my entire top lip to necrosis. I lost a small part of my top lip and I have some scarring around my mouth, but eventually the doctor managed to reverse the damage using hyaluronic acid. I just want to raise awareness of the risks that come with these procedures. In March , Chandra saved up for a month to have the £ procedure done.  She claims she had .ml injected into her top lip and couldnapost wait to see the results. Chandra, who has decided not to name the doctor, said: Although I am scared of needles, I was so excited to have it done. The procedure was super quick and over within  minutes but it was so painful I almost passed out. On the way home my lips were still so numb and I noticed them going white. I wasnapost surethis was normal but I tried not to think too much of it. Later on my face became so painful and stung. I kept checking the mirror and more white spots were appearing. I was panicking so I emailed them during the evening but as it was a Saturday I didnapost hear back. I cried the whole way through the night. The next morning my face was even whiter and I was freaking out. It kept getting worse.  On Monday I eventually managed to have a call with the doctor and he video called me to see how my face looked. As soon as he saw me he started freaking out and said that in  years of doing filler, he had never seen anything like this. Chandra claims the phone call worried her as the doctor revealed she would probably need to have it dissolved. She says that she called other clinics for a second opinion, and after emailing over pictures she was told to get seen immediately. Chandra added: A doctor from a dferent clinic told me that I had vascular occlusion and that I could have necrosis setting in. I went back to the doctor who done my filler and he injected four shots of hyaluronic acid to try and fix the issue. It was so painful and I was screaming while it was happening. I went back home thinking that it seemed better but more blisters were appearing and my face was still going whiter. The next day I had to go back again for nine more shots of hyaluronic acid in my face. My whole face was so swollen and I hadnapost eaten for almost a week because of the amount of pain my mouth had been in. The doctor had finally corrected his mistakes and after also going to trauma care, I was told I luckily didnapost need to use a hyperbaric tank and I was given some numbing cream and medication to help with scarring. A little chunk of my lip did fall off and I still have some scarring around my lips but it is a reminder to never put anything in my face again. The doctor kept in touch with me for two months to make sure everything was okay. He took care of me afterwards and tried to make things right. Iaposm not trying to scare people, I just want to raise awareness of the risks that come with getting filler injected into your face. I will never do anything like this again.

We have never tried to overfeed Liznya.  Some people wrote we do it on purpose. How do you imagine that  She even refuses to eat any other food than her diet food. It is true that our cat was pregnant and spayed after it, but we do not claim this is the exact reason for her to become obese. We wrote that she began to gain weight quickly since her pregnancy and even quicker after it. In an Instagram reel on Liznyaaposs page, her owners showed themselves measuring out g of Royal Canin diet food for her. In their post to answer questions about her diet, they explained that Liznya had been to the vets multiple times and that this was her current recommended diet.  But they also hit back at trolls who have wished death upon the owners and dispelled suggestions the rotund feline is unable to walk because of her weight problems. The post continued: She has been to the vet many times and has changed her diet plan more than once during this time. Now she seems to have stopped gaining weight with her current plan, but still there are problems with losing it.  We can’t show her to a vet too frequently, but we will definitely do it again and againneeded. We do not support any kinds of abuse and it is not OK to threaten the owners. And we also can’t ignore that some point out that our cat was slimmer in .  It is true, but she did not gain much weight since then, look at other old pictures taken from a dferent angle to make sure. And yes, Liznya can walk, she even loves to play hunting! We agree she needs to be more active to lose her weight. If some people still do not believe the above, well, that is your opinion, but please do not spread  information and do not wish the owners to die. It is a bit sad to read messages like this.  The fattest domestic cat to have lived on record was an Australian Tabby which weighed kg . In , an kg rescue kitty dubbed aposthe real-le Garfieldapos made global headlines when pictures emerged of his enormous figure. The lb cat, whose real name was Bronson, was quickly given a diet overhaul by his new owners Mike Wilson and Meghan Hanneman.

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

At that time, the local authority said the land was allocated for “circa  homes”.However, Persimmon Homes has gone beyond that figure and is looking to create a residential development of “circa  units”.Twenty-five per cent of the properties, which would include terraced, semi-detached and detached homes, would be classed as affordable.Access to the new homes would come from two new junctions created on Lammermoor Terrace, while a SUDSwould be created in the east of the site.Various studies will make up part of any application to the council.If the scheme is eventually approved, the developer will have to agree a sum for contributions to a range of projects, including extending both Windygoul Primary School and Ross High School.A sum would also be agreed “towards the enhancement of community sports facilities at Polson Park”.Money would also go towards covering the impact on a number of junctions, including Bankton Junction onto the A.Representatives from Persimmon Homes East Scotland were available to answer any questions about the scheme last Thursday afternoon.A spokesperson for the company revealed that nearly  people attended the online event.They said: “We hope local residents found it helpful:  attended and  questions were asked.“The most frequently raised concerns were general disruption during construction and extra local traffic on Birsley Road and Lammermoor Terrace.“Anyone who was unable to join the consultation can find out more about the proposed development by going to persimmonhomes lammermoor-terrace and sites.google view lam mermoor-terrace“Those wishing to comment can still do so by submitting an email or via post before January .“We will be reviewing all comments and how they can be addressed within the next stage of our planning application to East Lothian Council.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-railway-station-office-opening-hours-slashed","story":"Opening hours of the office at the station, which links the county with the north of England as well as Edinburgh, could be reduced by nearly  hours per week.The idea is being weighed up by ScotRail, which operates more than , train services through  stations throughout Scotland.Fewer than  stations have staffed ticket offices, with Dunbar making up part of that number.The move has been criticised by rail union RMT and the county’s MP Kenny MacAskill and MSP Paul McLennan.RMT is “wholly opposed” to cuts to ticket offices and believes that these will deter passengers from the rail network and make it less accessible for disabled and elderly passengers.They claim that cuts to ticket office hours worsen passenger service, safety and security by reducing the times that staff are guaranteed to be present at stations and make it far easier for operators to reduce overall staffing levels in the future.Mick Lynch, general secretary, said: “Cuts to ticket office hours will do nothing to restore passenger confidence in Scotland’s sustainable rail network, which has a central role to play in delivering modal sht away from high-carbon transport.“These proposals affect nearly all of the ticket offices in Scotland and will undoubtedly worsen passenger service and accessibility, as well as turning many of our stations into a mugger’s paradise.”Mr MacAskill backed the RMT in opposing the reduction in hours.Currently, the booking office – the only one of its kind in East Lothian – is open from .am to .pm from Monday to Friday.The proposed changes would see the office open at .am and shut at .pm with the exception of Friday, when it would close  minutes earlier.Changes would also be introduced on a Saturday and Sunday.The booking office opens at .am on a Saturday and shuts at .pm, with opening hours of .am to .pm on a Sunday. The changes would mean a am opening on Saturday, with a closure of pm, while Sunday would retain its opening time but shut at .pm.Mr MacAskill said: “As a regular user of the station, I share the views of RMT.“It’s a retrograde step.“The staff are helpful and essential, evenI’m often just picking up tickets from a machine.“It’s only Dunbar as others are unmanned but it’s a major station for the county.”Paul McLennan, who is East Lothian’s MSP as well as a councillor for the Dunbar and East Linton ward, encouraged people to take part in the consultation.He said: “Dunbar residents have less than three weeks to make their views known on the proposed changes to the ticket office opening times.“The changes to opening times at the weekends are the most signicant and will likely impact residents who travel to Edinburgh from Dunbar socially in the evening.“Last year, the community response from Dunbar residents was a driving force in the delaying of the proposed changes to rail services in East Lothian as part of the new East Coast Mainline timetable.”ScotRail offered a breakdown on how people purchased their tickets.More than  ticket vending machines have been installed across the country, with more than a quarter of all ticket sales coming through the machines.Internet access also accounts for about  per cent, with the number of people using ticket offices dropping from  per cent in  to  per cent in .According to ScotRail, the proposed changes would impact on  stations across the country.A spokesperson said: “Some locations may see minor changes whilst other locations may see reduced opening hours to align with customer usage. No staff will lose their jobs and will instead be redeployed to provide enhanced customer service on the frontline.”The consultation, which can be found at scotrail scotrail-ticket-office-consultation, closes on February ."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-week-hurdles-haddington-station","story":"The proposed level crossing at Gateside is almost certain to be a non-starter.

In fact, the benefits of plants and green spaces are now so well documented that medical professionals are beginning to see gardening as an important means of helping improve the wellbeing of some patients.Although not everyone is fortunate enough to have a garden, most will have space for an indoor plant and the value of those shouldn’t be overlooked. They remove the invisible air-borne pollutants that exist in all homes coming from everyday household cleaning products, decorating materials, upholstery and furniture.This, together with a plant’s natural ability to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, means that they are continuously improving the quality of the air that we breathe.In addition to these direct physical and mental benefits, home-grown vegetables are undoubtedly one of the best ways to source fresh, healthy food and reduce food miles. Just imagine the satisfaction of growing your own herbs and veg, and collecting on the very day you plan to use them in your meal – it just doesn’t get any fresher than that!If you’d like to try growing your own fresh, healthy meals, here’s a few ideas about how you might start:l Potatoes should be grown from certied seed potatoes which have been tested, are disease-free and true to iety. Seed potatoes are available now in reputable garden centres and you can start them off indoors, encouraging them to sproutso they have a start when you plant them out. Potatoes will generally be planted out in March April, with First Earlies harvesting as early as June July. Second Earlies can be harvested in August September, while Maincrop potatoes can be harvested into October. The early potatoes are those wonderfully tasty ‘new potatoes’ but don’t store as well as the maincrop ieties are able to be harvested and kept for use throughout the winter.l Brassica vegetables such as cabbage, caullower, sprouts and broccoli can be grown from seed starting in the next few weeks or purchased as seedlings in the garden centre in springtime when it’s time to plant them out.l Root vegetables such as carrots or parsnips can be dficult to transplant and prefer to be grown from seed sown directly into the place where they’ll grow.l Salad vegetables are mostly very easy to grow from seed and can be started indoors in the next few weeks until it’s warm enough to let them grow outdoors. It’s also an economical way to feed the family – for the price of a lettuce in the supermarket, you could buy a pack of seeds that could grow several hundred lettuce! Many salad vegetables only take a few weeks from sowing to harvesting, so we suggest that you sow a few little and often and you’ll have a continuous crop for many months of the year. Extend the season by starting or finishing the crop indoors when the weather is too cold for growing outdoor.l Microgreens, miniature vegetables that make an attractive and tasty garnish, take only days to grow from seed and are an easy kitchen window-sill crop. As with the salad vegetables, sow little and often to have a continuous crop.Hopefully this gives you some suggestions to help you with your plans for a healthier lestyle and even helps your budget!If you need more help and advice, our plant team are always delighted to help and you will find lots more information on the seed packets and online at merryhattonHappy gardening for !"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gastropub-named-best-uk","story":"The Bonnie Badger in Gullane, East Lothian placed in the - category, being awarded position number .The Estrella Damm Top  Gastropub Awards is created each year by an academy of several hundred judges spread throughout the UK who vote for who they think are the must-see gastropubs.The academy is made up of food industry experts, chefs, operators, food writers and journalists, all of whom keep a close eye on the market and the trends within.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CYUfxDIBS  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

That’s why regular lateral flow testing –we feel fine – continues to be an important part of our collective efforts to drive down infection levels.“Stoneyhill will continue to offer testing for people with no symptoms – complementing the deployment of mobile test units, pop-up collection services around local communities and self-ordered home deliveries.“As part of a national pilot, the facility will also now be offering PCR testing for people with symptoms.”There are more than  local and regional PCR testing centres and  mobile testing units operating in Scotland. The integrated community test sites are part of a pilot project designed to enhance testing provision in communities.Maree Todd MSP, minister for public health, women’s health and sport, said: “We continue to work with our partners to enhance the Covid- test system in Scotland. Including PCR testing within our targeted community testing programme through integration with our regional hub laboratories is a signicant development and will increase availability of testing within the four communities it is being piloted in.“By identying and isolating cases, we are breaking chains of transmission within those communities and giving us a better chance of stopping the virus from spreading.”For those who have symptoms of Covid, the advice remains to book a PCR test, evenyou have a positive lateral flow test.However, from January ,a lateral flow test is positive, and the person does not have symptoms, they will no longer be required to take a PCR test to confirm the result.Instead, the person concerned must immediately isolate and also report their result online so that Test  Protect can commence the contact tracing process and give advice as quickly as possible.As well as being available for collection from the Stoneyhill facility, it is possible for people to order home delivery of lateral flow testing kits online or collect a testing kit from a local pharmacy."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-start-plan-underwater-super-highway-east-lothian","story":"The SP

There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

From airport pick up to drop off, groups can play the world’s finest and most famous links, parkland and heathland golf courses.“All golfers are keen to play the Old Course, and we can arrange that,” says Derek Anderson. “But many, particularly ing groups, want to play one of the lesser-known courses and that can only come with knowledge of superb courses that might not appear in basic searches.“We have more than  courses in Scotland and many groups will want to play several while theyre here. Thats where we can step in. We can plan those routes, and make sure that when it comes to courses, we don’t miss those hidden gems.”With such a passion for everything that Scotland has to offer, GHW Golf Tours can offer experiences that take in the very best of everything we have to offer. In fact, even non-golfers will find so much to inspire and entertain them.“The knowledge and contacts I gained during the first few years in the industry were invaluable when GHW Golf Tours was established in ,” says Derek Anderson.“It was clear that we could offer a much more rounded experience than just providing the best possible golfing experience. This is Scotland. Look at everything we have to offer. I knew that we could create bespoke packages for every group, no matter their budget.”GHW Golf Tours can offer personally tailored packages to major golfing events, historic excursions, distillery tours, whisky tastings, castle visits, loch cruises, shooting, fishing and so much more.Talking with one of GHW’s Golf Tour consultants will show just how much is on offer. More importantly they listen and only offer a carefully curated tour. There’s nothing straight out of the box. Everything can be looked after. All you need to do is relax and concentrate on your game.The level of detail even runs to working with a company called Ship Sticks. “This means that golfers dont have to take their clubs on the flight. There are instances where clubs can go astray in transit. Golfers are rightly precious about their own clubs and when they have to use rented clubs, it really takes away something from the experience. So we can have the clubs ship to the first hotel, then they’re picked up at the end and transported back. It makes a huge dference.”It’s the care over those details that makes groupsto GHW Golf Tours.“Our drivers are much more like a concierge service. If you need a recommendation or where to locate a restaurant or a gt, they’ll know.“We can even provide helicopter transfers. When we’ve done that from St Andrews to East Lothian, the group has had the most spectacular view of flying over the Old Course, over the bridges and down to East Lothian. An amazing experience in itself.” It’s this level of attention to detail that led to the opening of a US office only two years later in , and located in Boston.“Perhaps it was having the Boston office, but we did find that the most inbound business was coming from America. But we have groups from Canada, France, Germany, Austria and Sweden. Even as far as Australia and Asia. This year we have a large group of Nigerian golfers coming over in May.”GHW Golf Tours also offers the same service to golfers looking to play the best courses across Ireland.“There are groups who only want to play championship courses and have a full luxury experience. Others are looking to play courses in one area, maybe the Highlands and islands. So we are constantly looking out for the best new experiences. No matter the budget, we can create the bespoke tour with memories that last a letime.”If there’s a fear of those memories fading, GHW Golf Tours can even organise a photographer or videographer to make sure that everyone gets a lasting record of the trip. That can be just shots taken on the st and th tee or candid shots and video can be taken throughout the round. Again there’s complete flexibility and the service can suit every group.“I’m looking forward to welcoming golfers back to Scotland from around the world. We couldn’t have groups over for about two years, but I’m optimistic that groups will be looking to visit and enjoy not only the golf but everything Scotland has to offer.”www.ghwgolftours"},{"url":null,"title":"sigrid-tickets-edinburgh-go-presale-today---get","story":"Sigrid has risen through the charts in the past few years with her standout single Don’t Kill my Vibe and globally acclaimed debut album Sucker Punch.The award-winning singer will be coming to Edinburghs Usher Hall on November  .Find out how to get beat the general sale and grab some pre-sale tickets. you haven’t bought tickets yet, you can get pre-sale access from this Thursday by pre-ordering a first pressing edition of my upcoming albumhttps:t.co mOAxBBUz pic zPMEJlXpnTo grab some pre-sale tickets you can sign up to My Live Nation and be in for the chance of the best seats when they go on sale at  am.Or you can pre-order a first pressing edition of the singers upcoming album via Sigrids website. You can also get general tickets for Sigrids UK tour on Friday, January  at  am via Live Nation. "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12939948.jpg?type=article-full","title":"adventure-cinema-open-air-tour-coming-edinburgh--films-can-watch","story":"The tour, which launches in April this year, will have showings of films such as Steven Spielbergs adaptation of West Side Story, musicals Mamma Mia!, Bohemian Rhapsody and classics like Dirty Dancing.These screenings give people the chance to watch cinema in the open air and under the stars in places like National Trust sites, medieval castles or country estates.HUGE NEWS!

The Mallaig to Lochboisdale service was to remain cancelled due to \"vessel availability\" being impacted by \"emergent steelwork repairs\" on the -year-old MV Caledonian Isles discovered while it was undergoing an overhaul.The MV Isle of Mull had been earmarked as potential cover for the South Uist service.The essential services timetable was introduced at the start of the month and saw cuts to ten of CalMac’s  routes including introducing a single vessel rather than the double ferry timetable for the service to and from Brodick on Arran - one of Scotlands busiest routes.Joe Reade, the chairman of the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee said it was the \"usual story of repeated breakdowns\".He said: \"The basic problem is that the service is relying on a small number of over-complex, over-aged vessels.\"In this instance, the Isle of Mull is now out of action whilst they investigate and hopefully fix it.

I’m looking forward to it and it’s a big game, so hopefully we can win,” he told manutd.“Me choosing to play for Iraq doesn’t mean I’m not a proud Mancunian or a proud Pakistani. I just feel this is the right opportunity for me as a player, the right step in my career and an honour, but it definitely doesn’t take away the fact that I’m a Mancunian and a Pakistani as well.”Iqbal became the first British South Asian to play for United as a late substitute against Young Boys in the Champions League in December.“It was massive, but it’s not something I really focused on since I was young,” he said.“I just enjoyed the sport and didn’t really think too much about that and as I got older, I realised that I was the first South Asian, so it’s a great thing but, ultimately, it’s just a lot of hard work that got me there.“The support has been great. I’ve had so many messages that I can’t read through them all! But the ones I have read have been really good and positive and hopefully I can keep it up and just excel from here.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

Covid passports will no longer be legally required in bars, restaurants and cinemas but will still be needed to gain access to a club or to indoor unseated or partially seated events with  people or more.On Tuesday the Department of Health recorded , positive cases of Covid and five deaths in the past  hours.Joe said he hoped that an Executive meeting on February  would remove mandatory Covid certication in all settings to bring nightclubs and other entertainment venues into line with the rest of hospitality.And he said nightclubs had suffered more than any other hospitality setting throughout the pandemic. “It’s coming up to two years since restrictions were introduced and as of today, we’ve been closed for  weeks and open for eight,” he said.“It’s not commonly understood just how catastrophic restrictions have been for us. There have been so many dferent permutations of reopening, that people are confused by it all.“If, for example, you attended a seated concert or a comedy or magic show and wanted to stand up or dance, that hasn’t been possible for  weeks.“Without clarity, we’ve lost access to touring events. A band or DJ touring England and thinking about adding a show in Ireland is faced with a tough decisionnot sure what the rules are orthey might change at any minute.“Anyone who plays to a standing or partially standing audience might then prioritise where, so that’s been very dficult.” Joe said that while it was harder to arrange gigs hastily following last-minute lting of restrictions, the demand for nightclubs was still evidently there, particularly among students. Club nights at The Limelight are selling out fast from Wednesday through to the weekend and staff are gearing up for a busy period ahead. But he’s in no doubt about the upcoming challenges for the sector.“Hopefully this is the end of the restrictions and we can get back to planning and back to business,” he said.“But it’s going to take a long time to fully recover from the damage for many sectors including hospitality, retail and travel.”At the Kremlin nightclub, a deep clean of the premises was under way ahead of reopening and staff were brought in to ensure the sound and light systems were ready for Wednesday night.Allen Gordon said the last reopening had been ‘phenomenal’ and that he was expecting an even better turnout this time around.And he said he was hopeful for the future of the nightclub.“There has been a fantastic reaction on social media to the reopening of the club and we’re expecting a big crowd down come the weekend,” he said.“The response was phenomenal the last time we reopened and we’re expecting an even better reaction this time.“It’s been a dficult time with all the closures and reopenings but it looks like we’re coming out of it now and I don’t think this will happen again, all these restrictions being put in place.“Here’s hoping we’re at the tail end of it, plus we’re coming into the better weather. People want out.“The reopening of nightclubs is a much-needed boost for hospitality.”Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid rules: When can I go to a nightclub and what  is changing today NI Coronavirus travel rules: Changes for arrivals from non-red list countries‘Solutions needed’ for hospital waiting list crisisSenior civil servant Sue Gray probing Tories ‘faced down IRA hijack bid’LatestSpoty ‘regrets’ Neil Young’s choice to remove music over Covid misinformationTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceUS stocks slide after Fed signals interest rates will rise ‘soon’Andrew’s civil sex trial threatens monarchy, says leading lawyerCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The building is being taken over by an art and drama group which, I believe, will have access to the required funding for a proper refurbishment.“We regard this as an exciting opportunity to literally move on to a site nearer the city centre, and we are most grateful that the Great Victoria Street Church is giving us such a warm welcome.“Our closing service this Sunday will include a number of special guests including several of our former ministers, and the Presbyterian Moderator, the Right Reverend Dr Bruce. It will certainly be a landmark occasion, and for some people an emotional occasion as well.”Over the years Windsor church, on the corner of the Lisburn Road and Derryvolgie Avenue, amalgamated with others in the South Belfast Presbytery. In  it merged with the former Broadway Presbyterian Church on the Falls Road, which is now an Irish Language Centre. Recently the Windsor members shared an Irish language service of worship at the centre.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Then in , Windsor amalgamated with Ulsterville Presbyterian Church on the Lisburn Road. Cecil Graham, a longtime Presbyterian and elder at Windsor said: “In  in response to the increasing number of immigrants coming to Belfast, the South Belfast Presbytery in partnership with the Council for Mission in Ireland established the International Meeting Point project on the Lisburn Road.“Partnership with the IMP has been instrumental in reviving the Windsor congregation, and many of its members attend our Sunday services.” In its heyday, Windsor was one of the most fashionable and influential Presbyterian churches in Ireland. Two of its ministers became moderators — Rev John Irwin in  and Rev William Corkey in . The Corkey family in particular made a signicant contribution to the wider work of the Church, including the establishment of Adelaide House and other care homes.Windsor church has also made an important contribution to the Mission Outreach of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, and particularly in China and India. During the Second World War, Windsor missionaries were imprisonment by the Japanese.It has had eight ministers in its history, including Rev Steen.The church is on the list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. It was designed in  by the architects Young and MacKenzie who also designed the Robinson and Cleaver building opposite Belfast City Hall.Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest Northern IrelandTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for leTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at riskAs the Big Two battling it out in a thrilling Premiership title race, three former players tell us who will have the edgeDoug Beattie must seek help for ‘misogyny issues’, says women’s rights expertLatestSpoty ‘regrets’ Neil Young’s choice to remove music over Covid misinformationTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceUS stocks slide after Fed signals interest rates will rise ‘soon’Andrew’s civil sex trial threatens monarchy, says leading lawyerCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We should consider putting the machine on the capital services list for expenditure or at least come up with some way to protect out employees.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I am conscious some staff are having to get down and lt it themselves. There are other health and safety issues as well, particularly in relation to children across parks and round by schools and quite often at the end of garden paths.“Hopefully it can be brought back through committee with a report detailing what Belfast are doing and there experience.”Sinn Fein councillor Keith Haughian seconded the proposal and called for an innovative approach to be taken to tackle the problem.“I would wholeheartedly second the proposal that more is brought to committee. This issue is not going away, in fact it is getting worse and that is a reflection on us as a council,” he said.“We need to be asking other areas what they are doing and to come up with better ideas.“It is fair to say although there is a lot of stuff that can ide us in this chamber, all of us will be united when it comes to these issues. When I speak to Alderman Stephen Moutray we can do nothing but agree that the dog fouling issue just seems to get worse and worse.“It is a timely proposal in a sense. As we move towards the end of the pandemic, we can’t just go back to what we did before and hope that it works, we need to be more innovative so I am happy to second the proposal from Councillor Causby.”Lord Mayor Glenn Barr noted there has been a “massive rise” in dog ownership throughout the borough recently.Councillor Kyle Savage noted it is not just the urban centres where the issue of dog fouling is a problem.“The rural areas of Waringstown and Dollingstown are feeling it too. There is one lady I know has lted  bags of dog poo, that is not acceptable it is not the dogs it is the irresponsible dog owners we need to be looking at,” he said.“I agree with the two councillors before me we need to be looking at other areas of good practice and seeing what we can do to improve but it really lies with the dog owner.“There are perhaps not enough people on the ground but it is totally irresponsible, dog owners need to wise up and clean up after themselves.”Noting the problem is just as bad in Rathfriland as it is in Banbridge, Lurgan and Portadown, Councillor Paul Greenfield said he believes the problem is “getting worse”.Thanking Mr Causby for bringing the proposal forward, Councillor Declan McAlinden said dog fouling in rural areas has become “absolutely ridiculous”.“We all see the figures for our town centres, but we need to see them for rural areas as well,” he said.“Rural roads at the minute are a disgrace and recently I was driving past a local school and the youngsters were having to step over dog foul outside the school, it is absolutely ridiculous.”With the proposal receiving the support of the chamber, officers will now draft and present a report on the issue to Council’s environmental services committee as soon as possible.Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest Northern IrelandTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for leTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at riskAs the Big Two battling it out in a thrilling Premiership title race, three former players tell us who will have the edgeDoug Beattie must seek help for ‘misogyny issues’, says women’s rights expertLatestSpoty ‘regrets’ Neil Young’s choice to remove music over Covid misinformationTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceUS stocks slide after Fed signals interest rates will rise ‘soon’Andrew’s civil sex trial threatens monarchy, says leading lawyerCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Then place a new, dry sheet of toilet tissue across the back of the pan. Leave it in place for up to three hours without using the toilet . If the paper is wet or torn in the morning, you know you have a leaky loo.A free LeakyLoo strip can also be ordered by visiting www.savewatersavemoney and entering your postcode.If you have a leak they normally are pretty straight forward for an approved plumber or keen DIY-er to fix, either by adjusting or replacing the bits inside a cistern with new parts.

retweeted untrue allegations of child sex abuse.Among those who had to pay out were Sally Bercow, we of then Commons Speaker John Bercow, and the comedian Alan Davies.Lord McAlpine’s legal counsel said at the time the latter’s “reckless retweet” of a defamatory statement “fanned the work of internet trolls”.Lord McAlpine initiated, or at least threatened, legal action against  Twitter users, with it being accepted by the court that the retweeting of a libel was actionable.Mr Beattie is still in his job despite dozens of other derogatory messages dating back to  coming to light, some containing racist, misogynist and Islamophobic slurs, as well as offensive posts about the Traveller community.On the same day the Poots tweet was posted, an opinion poll for the Belfasthad him as the most popular party leader.He has since said the posts were “pretty horric” and he was “deeply ashamed” of them.However, he denied he was a racist or a misogynist.Mr Beattie insisted the tweets were “not who I am”.Mrs Poots, a Sunday school teacher, has always shunned the limelight.She was said to be deeply upset by the Ulster Unionist leader’s post.Mr Poots originally said he accepted Mr Beattie’s apology, but he questioned his “poor” judgment in posting it in the first place.But now it has been confirmed that he is taking legal action over the post.Patrick Higgins, from solicitors Donnelly and Wall, said yesterday: “Today we instigated proceedings on behalf or Mrs and Mr Poots against Mr Beattie MLA and Mr Hoare MP who published this tweet.“This post constitutes a grave and unwarranted attack on my clients’ reputation.“As a couple of  years, married for , it has caused my clients profound distress.“As a lady who has recently retired after dedicating her le as a nurse to caring for terminally ill children, it is wholly inappropriate for any persons to make such comments, and the publication has caused immense hurt to her, her husband and their family.”Following a meeting of Ulster Unionist MLAs and party officers yesterday, it was announced Mr Beattie would remain as leader.He said: “I have had detailed conversations with all of my MLAs, I apologised for what I had done directly to each one of them, and then I spoke [about] whether or not I still had their support to remain as party leader — overwhelmingly, every one of them said ‘yes, I did’.”While there has been no public statement from senior elected members, some of the party’s junior members have come out in support.Kate Evans, who works in Mr Beattie’s constituency office, posted online that she had worked for the Upper Bann MLA for six years, adding: “I wouldn’t be the person I am todayit weren’t for his support and encouragement over those years as I recovered from domestic violence.“I don’t recognise the man in those tweets.“I accept his apology and I support him.”Julie-Anne Corr-Johnson, who joined the UUP last year as a North Belfast representative, said: “There is no other leader I trust more with my children’s future than @BeattieDoug.”Bethany Ferris, a party officer, said: “Everyone has a past. This is why I fundamentally believe in judging people for who they are now. @BeattieDoug has always been kind and supportive… I admire him for taking responsibility for his past and trust him to lead our party into the future.”Most ReadDoors close on Windsor Presbyterian ChurchMan who died in Carrickfergus crash incident named locally as John TraynorMichelle O’Neill says historical tweets by Sinn Fein politicians ‘not acceptable’ as three MLAs issue apologiesQuiet man: Sue Gray’s country singer husband prefers to let his music do the talkingIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesTop VideosPlayVideo: School bully is knocked out after trying to punch a blind kid - Warning Graphic LanguagePlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayDoug Beattie apologises for tweeting #joke# about DUP minister#s weLatest Northern IrelandTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for leTranslink cuts put over , bus and rail services at riskAs the Big Two battling it out in a thrilling Premiership title race, three former players tell us who will have the edgeDoug Beattie must seek help for ‘misogyny issues’, says women’s rights expertLatestSpoty ‘regrets’ Neil Young’s choice to remove music over Covid misinformationTaoiseach set to attend Bloody Sunday memorial serviceUS stocks slide after Fed signals interest rates will rise ‘soon’Andrew’s civil sex trial threatens monarchy, says leading lawyerCrusaders threaten to ban Glentoran assistant manager Paul Millar for le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Geraldine Scott and Patrick Daly, PA Political StaffJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBoris Johnson is coming under increasing pressure to explain his role in the evacuation of animals from Afghanistan amid reports he did influence their removal from Kabul – despite his denials.No  has repeatedly said Mr Johnson had no involvement in pushing for help for the charity Nowzad, after accusations that officials’ time was taken up supporting the charity rather than people who could have been brought to the UK.Leaked emails surfaced on Wednesday in which Foreign Office officials suggest the Prime Minister “authorised” their rescue, despite Mr Johnson previously saying it was “complete nonsense” that he had intervened.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ba .ece

was then parliamentary private secretaryto Mr Johnson, had contacted a private charter company to try to secure a plane to help with the Nowzad evacuation, and a source at the company told the broadcaster it was implicit that she was acting with the PM’s backing.Ms Harrison previously wrote to former Royal Marine Paul “Pen” Farthing, who ran the Nowzad shelter, to inform him the evacuation would go ahead.She told Sky News on Wednesday that she had contacted companies, and had told staff she was a PPS to Mr Johnson, but that she was acting as a constituency MP and Mr Johnson was not involved in plans around the evacuation.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, in his second comment on the situation in a matter of hours, said the Nowzad evacuation was “nothing to do with the Prime Minister”.Documents released by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee overnight showed how Sir Philip Barton – the Foreign Office’s permanent-under secretary – said he was “not aware” of support for the decision to evacuate Nowzad either in No  or from the Prime Minister.He said that “beyond speculation in the public domain” he did not know of any reason civil servants would attribute the decision to the PM.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aebcb--cd-bb-ec_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk fbc .ece AUTOCROP w

it’s correct”.Earlier, the Defence Secretary told broadcasters: “The claims that have been made and emails from the Foreign Office, who were not responsible for the actual evacuation operation, I don’t know where they come from but they certainly don’t show the reality, which was: I was in charge, the Prime Minister never asked me, it was nonsense.”No  also issued a statement, coming shortly after the Prime Minister’s official spokesman held a briefing with reporters, stressing that Mr Johnson had played “no role” in the UK armed forces rescue mission, Operation Pitting, or the evacuation of animals from the Taliban-captured territory.Mr Farthing launched a high-profile campaign to get his staff and animals out of Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul, using a plane funded through donations.The UK Government sponsored clearance for the charter flight, leading to allegations that animals had been prioritised over people in the exit

leaked email exchanges to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, with MPs making them public on Wednesday.The evidence shows an official in the private office of Lord Goldsmith – a joint Foreign Office and environment minister – told colleagues working on the evacuation on August  that “the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated”, in reference to the charity Nowzad.Lord Goldsmith tweeted: “I did not authorise and do not support anything that would have put animals’ lives ahead of peoples’.“My position, which I made clear publicly, was that the UK should prioritise evacuating people.“I never discussed the Nowzad charity or their efforts to evacuate animals with the PM.”The email was handed to the committee by Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Officeat the time, and has claimed the animals were evacuated following a direct instruction from the Prime Minister.Dominic Dyer, who led the political lobbying campaign from the UK for Nowzad to be offered support, said Mr Johnson’s refusal to acknowledge his role in the evacuation had “tarnished” the campaign.Mr Dyer said the published emails “vindicated” what he had previously set out, and argued the Prime Minister could be “very proud of giving support to this as a humanitarian rescue mission”.He told the PA news agency: “I’m not certain why he didn’t feel he could explain his involvement in August at the end of this operation.“It has tarnished what has been a very important operation that had huge public support.”He told Sky News: “I know Trudy Harrison, the PPS to the Prime Minister that was helping us on the campaign team, reached out to the CEO of Virgin Atlantic, and we were just looking at dferent options that were available to us.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aebcb--cd-bb-ec_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aebcb--cd-bb-ec_embedded w\"

is expected to start shortly on a major internal upgrade at Ballynahinch Community Centre.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has drawn up plans to reconfigure the internal layout of the Windmill Street facility as part of a signicant investment initiative.Local people are being asked for their views on the planned upgrade which could be completed as early as the summer and cost in the region of pound,.Confirmation that work is to start soon on the centre upgrade has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who has also thanked Strangford MP Jim Shannon and her council colleague Billy Walker for their support in driving the renovation programme forward.She revealed that she had been contacted by a number of residents about the slow progress of the scheme and is pleased that everything is now on track.In addition to the planned work at the community centre, consideration is also being given to investing around pound, to finance internal alterations of the local authority-owned Market House in the town centre.And the Recorder understands that consideration is being given to providing an ultra-modern G sports pitch at the Langley Road playing fields with the adjoining sports pavilion also in line for a major upgradeA number of politicians have been lobbying for the local authority to address what they described as the organisationrsquos ldquounder investment in Ballynahinch and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities is a critical component of its future investment plans.Council officials had previously been asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.However, they have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

And as well as their cultural signicance the implications for the economic and tourism attraction of the historic centre of the county are obvious.They add: ldquoWe call on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to halt its current direction of travel and demonstrate a commitment to restoring what was an internationally recognised centre of excellence in Downpatrick.ldquoWe ask it to respect its moral responsibility to honour the trust placed in the museum by those thousands of donors and friends who expected the council to cherish and support this public treasure house of the shared histories of County Down.Last week a spokesperson for the council said it was ldquocommitted to the continuous improvement and development of its museums.The spokesperson also said a meeting was held in December with stakeholders and elected representatives to clary there would be a reduction in ldquostaff head count following the restructuring.ldquoFurther engagement with stakeholders is planned for early this year and we look forward to working with all our partners to advance the councilrsquos ambitious and exciting plans for our museum services, the spokesperson added.See Letters on pages  and ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"Down go under against Antrim  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo disappointing start to their Dr McKenna Cup campaign continued when they lost out to Antrim by two points in Newry last week.The defeat means back-to-back losses for James McCartanrsquos new-look side, despite some encouraging inidual performances throughout from the Mourne outfit.Down will count themselves unlucky not to gain anything from the contest, having gone tit for tat with the Saffrons in the first half and Barry OrsquoHagan seeing his last gasp goal bound effort ricocheting over the bar instead of hitting the back of the net.McCartanrsquos men got off to a dream start when the newly ed Niall McParland sent a long ball forward into the hands of Ryan OrsquoHiggins, who opened the scoring through a well struck goal just three minutes in.Ruairi McCann and Odhran Eastwood confidently kicked over frees to bring Antrim within one point of levelling the scores before Packie OrsquoHagan doubled Downrsquos lead just before the  minute mark.Antrim did manage to completely reduce the deficit before the first water-break, with two quick-fire scores coming from Patrick McBride and a Pat Shivers free.As the players rehydrated, the surrounding supporters at Pairc Esler were awarded time to catch their breath as the fast paced game was momentarily brought to a halt.Veteran Darren OrsquoHagan entered the fray in the place of John McGeough upon the resumption before James Laverty kicked over a point from play to give the visitors the lead for the first time in the match.A well worked attack ended with Kevin McKernan levelling proceedings once again for the hosts, and soon after captain Caolan Mooney fired over between the sticks to give his side the advantage.Things began heating up in the cold weather, with plenty of firm challenges on show.Anytime the Mourne side were edging ahead, Antrim were right on their coattails and were now starting to overpower the home side in dferent areas of the pitch.Antrimrsquos McCann kicked over two unanswered points, the first from a rsquorsquo and the second from a free, although Downrsquos sharpshooting Barry OrsquoHagan restored parity in a matter of seconds.With three minutes to the interval, McCann converted his fourth free of the night to give the Saffrons a one point lead.Half time: Down - Antrim -.Down boss McCartan made his second change of the night in the form of Ross Carr swapping out Josh Connery to help give his county a dferent option at the back, although they conceded their first goal of the contest a minute into the restart.Patrick McBride duly converted a fisted effort past Downrsquos Rory Burns after Antrim team-mate Jamie McCann powered his way through the home defence.Down responded positively, splitting the sticks three times unanswered with scores from a Barry OrsquoHagan free and a brace of points from play through McKernan and Darren OrsquoHagan.After over ten minutes without a score on the board, Antrim finally kicked over the bar through Michael McCann.Causing further problems for Down, McCann proved important at both sides of the pitch when he managed to catch lsquokeeper Burnsrsquo attempted rsquo to rule out any chance of a goal.At the second water-break, the home side trailed by two with it all still to play for as both sides made changes.Barry OrsquoHagan took the mark and knocked over a brace of frees to level the scores but once again, Antrim would not be deterred and replied with a point from play by substitute Conor Murray.As the clock ticked down the next few scores would be vital in deciding the outcome and unfortunately for the home support they wouldnrsquot be given much more to cheer about.With two minutes of regulation time to go, Patrick McBride struck over what looked like an insurance point for the Saffrons.As the official announced three minutes of added time, Down pressed high in search of that crucial goal to share the points.With one last opportunity awarded to Down in the form of a free, Barry OrsquoHagan stepped up to fire his effort towards the net.However, the ball would have to travel past a sea of Antrim bodies that had smartly piled across the goal line.Agonisingly, OrsquoHaganrsquos effort smashed off the opposing Antrim wall of defence before clipping the crossbar on its way over to give the visitors a dramatic victory.Down: R Burns P Fegan, B McArdle, G Collins J Connery, N McParland, J McGeough A Doherty, L Middleton R OrsquoHiggins , C Mooney , C OrsquoRawe B OrsquoHagan , P OrsquoHagan , K McKernan Subs: D OrsquoHaganfor McGeough, R Carr for Connery, T Prenter for P OrsquoHagan.

So far the youths have engaged in wanton vandalism of ious areas of the village including putting dog faeces through letter boxes and damaging the villagersquos Christmas tree and festive lights last month.The RUC says it is vital that members of the public provide information which will bring an end of the vandalism problem.ldquoWe need the help of the community to bring those responsible to court, and without that help it will be very dficult to put an end to this problem, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Management at the GPT telecommunications plant in Ballynahinch have pledged to work towards ensuring that it continues to have a future following the weekend announcement of  redundancies.The company, which manufactures hi-tech switching equipment for the telecommunications industry, revealed on Friday that it is to slice its workforce by more than half.The job losses will reduce the workforce at the Antrim Road plant to .

The branches were burnt on a bonfire, and all plastic collected was taken to Drumnakelly dump for safe disposal.Among the workers who took part in the work day was Mrs Sheila Lewis-Crosby, who along with her husband John is the owner of the mill pond. She and Drumaness woman Mrs Carmel Mason cleared brambles constructing a path alongside the dam.After the clean-up, the secretary of the Friends of Drumaness, Dam Lisa Fagan, congratulated the volunteers and thanked local councillor Patsy Toman for initiating the venture.ldquoThe Drumaness people can be proud of our achievement here today, she said. ldquoThere is no doubt that the whole community is sickened by these incidents, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash People who take part in the after-dark practice of ldquolamping rabbits have this week been warned they are placing themselves in danger.The RUC has warned that people who dress up in combat clothing and walk around fields hunting rabbits with firearms could find themselves being confronted by a security force patrol.Over the Christmas and New Year period, the RUC received reports of ldquolamping in the Downpatrick and Crossgar areas and it also believed to have occurred around Saintfield.The practice has been a problem in the Castlewellan area for a number of years but it is relatively unknown in east Down.It involves hunters going into fields without farmersrsquo permission and shooting rabbits by torchlight.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history.

In the latest year tax revenues from NI amounted to only % of the cost of public services. The rest comes from taxpayers in Great Britain, from Treasury borrowing, and in the Covid crisis by the Bank of England printing new money.The main reason for this mighty uplt in spending in   was of course Covid, or to be precise, the UK government’s decisions on supporting the economy during the pandemic. The size and success of these policies has not been given its full credit. Especially in Northern Ireland there has not been sufficient recognition of how much we owe to our membership of a UK economic union which has been able to incur huge expenditure with minimal financial strain.The truly massive increase in national UK-wide public spendingwas accompanied by a fall in UK tax revenuesas the pandemic shrank the economy, and government borrowing soared to close to % of national income. In its efforts to prevent a general economic collapse and a catastrophic rise in unemployment, the Treasury spent £ billion on employment schemes including furloughing, a similar amount on the NHS, and £ billion on losses from its generous loans and loan guarantees to private firms. The measures have been a great success, with national output in late  back to pre-pandemic . The extra spending is often described as ‘tax-payers money’ but this is not correct. There has been no increase in tax rates evensome rises are in the pipeline. The pandemic measures have been completely financed by rising indebtedness, but is it not debt that needs to be repaid by future generations or that requires interest payments  In fact, nearly all of the extra finance came from the Bank of England printing new money. Although the printing of money is the most mysterious aspect of economics, what happened is relatively clear. To bridge the gap between its soaring expenses and its shrinking revenues the Treasury issued new bonds to pension funds and others. At the same time the Bank of England bought an equivalent amount of bonds from the pension and insurance industry, paid for by newly printed money. The result is that around a quarter of government bonds are now owned by the Bank of Englandand on which the government pays no interest. In this way Northern Ireland has been spared the enormous cost of financing the worst pandemic in living memory. A financially strong and independent UK allows Northern Ireland to carry on financially as though nothing untoward had happened. Nor is there a serious burden of debt to be repaid in future. My view is that the Treasury has handled the pandemic very successfully. Unemployment has hardly risen and relatively few firms gave gone bust. Some economists worry that printing money leads to inflationbut this does not necessarily follow in a temporary crisis like a pandemic. Prices have risen due to pandemic-related shortages but these rises should ease soon.Next year the government’s financial situation shouldto normal, but normal for NI means high spending on public services at % above the UK average per person. This generosity allows NI to spend more than other UK regions on key services like health, education, policing and housing. Most of the money comes as a lump sum for the NI Executive to spend as it wishes. Some decisions look decidedly odd. NI now spends less than almost any other region on economic developmentor science and technology but much more than other regions on culture arts and leisure, in the latter case more even than London on a per head basis.The largescale UK Treasury support for NI is viewed as a normal cost of maintaining the union. Support is also fairly lavish for other devolved regions although never as much as for NI. Within Northern Ireland the subsidy from GB taxpayers is a source of embarrassment and rarely discussed. It is seen as indicating a local economy too weak to pay its bills, but this not really correct. The economy is reasonably strong and grows, as expected, at about the UK average rate. However, with a traditionally highbirth rate, the population in NI expanded faster than in GB in the past. The consequence until recently was a serious shortage of jobs. Migration to GB kept the labour market in rough balance but unemployment rates were usually the highest in the UK. The national government responded by creating public sector jobs and fully funding the social security system. The Troubles increased this tendency and money poured in leading to rapid job creation. As a result, NI had less out-migration and thus a larger population than would have been the case in the absence of the UK’s largesse.In recent years with lower birth rates, out-migration has been reversed and more people come into NI each year than leave. Unemployment is now low, and living standards are quite close to the UK average not least because of the generosity of public spending but also because house prices are low. Nationalist commentators like to point to the public sector subsidies as a source of weakness but are perplexed because the high standard of public services undoubtedly persuades many Catholics to tell pollsters that they prefer the union to Irish unity. The strength of the UK economy means that this position is permanently sustainable and there is little or no political pressure to reduce the subsidies. Just the opposite in fact, since Tory economic policy is centred on levelling up living standards across the regions. The pandemic has shown again how important the UK financial union is, not least to Northern Ireland.• Dr Gudgin is honorary research associate at Centre for Business Research, Judge Business Scholl, Cambridge University and was an advisor to David Trimble as first minister——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast year because we were in deep lockdown it never happened and because of the current Covid rules it had to be postponed again, which is probably why only three walkers came out to meet him at the Knap car terrace in perfect walking weather, on a bright and crisp morning to join in a -mile replacement walk.On the hillside just above them are the neat foundations of a Roman Building which contained  rooms all grouped around a courtyard with the building being dated to the late rd century AD by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. It seems a natural harbour was to be found to the east of this area and one theory is that this was a guesthouse connected with naval activity at the harbour as no evidence of a water supply or baths common in villa’s could be found. In the early ’s the trust carried out excavations on site and pieces of Roman pottery and tiles were found and a public viewing  now overlooks the site.They soon warmed up due to a short but stf climb onto the clftop and followed a narrow path through woodland to descend the Golden Stairs into Porthkerry Country Park, where the frost covered board walk led them towards the ft Porthkerry Viaduct. Deviating off the cycle path at Robin’s Walk brought them into muddy fields beside the Whitelands Brook for the climb up to join the A opposite Welford and along the verge to cross a stile leading into fields behind Blackton Farm.A well-worn farm track led to the road for the journey to Penmark Village where they entered the churchyard of St Mary’s for their mid-morning refreshments, utilising the steps on the preaching cross as seating whilst enjoying the warm sunshine. The church dates to the th century being mentioned for the first time in  and a few centuries later the tower was added, but most of its medieval traits were lost when it was renovated during the Victorian era..removeThey continued and joined part of the long distance Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail, through fields on the boundary of Cardf Airport making towards Fonmon with its lovely duck pond and stunning weeping willow tree which cascades over the water. Then climbing steps into a small wood leading to muddy fields near Home Farm they eventually exited onto Port Road following it southwards to East Aberthaw.Taking time out they paused at the Blue Anchor for a swt pint outside in the fresh air before following Well Road downhill. This road was previously known as Marshe Way, one would presume because the River Thaw flowed to reach the sea by this route until the Aberthaw Power Station was built and the river was re-routed.Tramping muddy paths below the main Vale railway line through the nature reserve which is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest, they headed through the reed beds beside the western end of the delightful lake, overseen by the ruined Aberthaw Limeworks built in , to arrive at the sea defence wall. Heading out onto the beach they found a suitable place for lunch sitting on a washed up tree trunk beside the dunes and overlooking the Bristol Channel and English coastline before continuing along the salt flats.The beautul refurbished clf steps on part of the Wales Coast Path brought them steeply uphill into Fontygary Leisure Park, which was eerily quiet due to the winter months and reaching Fontygary beach, they continued up steps following the coast path past the old disused limestone quarries to reach the southernmost tip of mainland Wales and Rhoose Point. Onward through Porthkerry Holiday Park and the Iron Age hillfort at the Bulwarks, to slither downhill through the woods back into Porthkerry for the steep climb back up the Golden Stairs in order to make their way along the clftop to Cold Knap, just as the sun was sinking in the western sky.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

On Monday, January , the council’s cabinet signed off plans to consult the public on its plan to introduce the nursery places.Cllr Ben Gray, cabinet member for social care and health, said: “This school needs to be replaced — it’s clearly a building which is not fit for purpose. It’s really important that this moves forward and St Nicholas gets a primary school which is fit for purpose.”The new school would be built on the current site, just north of the main building. The main building would then be demolished, and the space used for car parking and spaces for parents and carers who drive to drop off their children, addressing existing congestion issues. The school would still be just a short walk away from the village’s church.According to a recent cabinet report, the current school buildings have “major defects”, with an estimated maintenance backlog of £,, adversely affecting teaching. The school has also faced issues with sinkholes and radon gas. Reception pupils have to walk to the nearby Old School building after morning assembly, along a road without pavement.Demand for local nursery places is growing, with new housing estates recently built in St Nicholas and Bonvilston, and permission for  more houses east of St Nicholas and  east of Bonvilston..removeBut the cabinet decided it would be too expensive to find an alternative site for building a replacement school twice the size of the current one, and instead chose to put forward the new plan for a school with  places and  nursery places. Refurbishing the current buildings was also seen as too tricky given the condition of the buildings and parking issues.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education, said: “The school wanted to stay where it is. It is a Church in Wales school and they felt that their connection to the church was very important. The buildings would be very dficult to refurbish — they’re not up to scratch and it would be very dficult to retrofit them and to fit in a nursery.”The council’s planning committee has not yet granted permission for the replacement school building. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The coal office is now home to the family-run business Robinson’s Shoes,” Lee added. “We will shortly launch a virtual reality tour of the exhibition which was funded through donations from the community.“As well as gathering people’s harbour stories online last year, we held a number of online events at the start of  before opening our shop in June . “We’ve held a range of conversations in the shop, music events, art classes and collaborative mapping workshops, taking people on a tour of the town and coming together to make maps that tell their stories of their towns and their aspirations for the future. “We’ve also supported local businesses and community groups who have used our shop space for meetings and as a pop up shop.”Plans for the year aheadAs for the coming year, Positive Carrickfergus is putting together plans to take forward the Wildest Dreams work and developing projects with a number of other organisations, such as Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and the Eco Rangers.Their work was also recognised in December  as the Best Community or Social Initiative award at the Carrickfergus Business Excellence Awards.To find out more about the group and any upcoming events, visit the website at https:positivecarrickfergus.org "},{"url":null,"title":"visitor guide out now ","story":"Young motorist was ‘very unfortunate’ says solicitor   Four casualties taken to Craigavon Area Hospital after crash in Co DownNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsCouncilVisitor Guide out nowThe latest Causeway Coast and Glens Visitor Guide packed full of things to see and do across the area is out now.By Una CulkinWednesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  This free publication features information about discovery points, trails and tours along with inspiration about Taste Causeway, Game of Thrones, the Économusee network and a round-up of the best places for a game of golf.Copies of the guide are available locally in the area’s Visitor Information Centres and they will also be used further afield to promote the destination to national and international visitors across Ireland, overseas and at trade and Consumer Shows worldwide.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
