The findings will now constrain the liberties of everyone in Britain for much of the next 18 months. (Stock image)DO NOTHING?The Imperial College calculations show that if coronavirus were allowed to run its horrifying course in Britain unchecked, the results would be apocalyptic.Deaths would peak in the third week of June, with more than 20 people out of every 100,000 in Britain succumbing to the virus — almost 13,300 every day.Ultimately, more than 80 per cent of us might be infected.Critical-care beds would be filled completely by mid-April, with an eventual peak in demand 30 times bigger than the health service\u0027s maximum capacity.America, the report adds, would see 2.2 million deaths.The authors point out that this would only be part of the toll: many more would die of other illnesses because hospitals would be overwhelmed.Thankfully, however, nobody is recommending this approach.NOT ENOUGH?         The paper suggests that stopping mass events is predicted to have relatively little impact. (Stock image)The Prime Minister\u0027s original strategy against coronavirus was relatively limited, including asking people who had contracted the virus to self-isolate at home.Just four days later, he was asking us to put our lives on hold, possibly for months or longer.That first \u0027mitigation\u0027 strategy was based on the hope that the virus might progress at a predictable speed.Since the vast majority of people recover from coronavirus with no lasting harm, thereby acquiring immunity (at least for a time), the theory was that so-called herd immunity would kick in and the epidemic would die out.However, the computer simulation from the Imperial College team showed that mitigation would let the epidemic run like wildfire, causing an emergency surge in demand that would be at least eight times larger than the health service\u0027s ability to cope.Even if all those emergency patients could be treated, the report grimly predicts that about a quarter of a million Britons would die under this approach.SUPPRESSION KEYWith doing nothing and mitigating both predicted to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, the report stresses that \u0027epidemic suppression is the only viable strategy\u0027.This aims to reduce cases to low levels, making sure that the average person infects less than one person.To achieve this, the entire population of Britain must be instructed to distance themselves from others as far as possible, at work and at leisure.That is why everyone is now being told to avoid socialising, travelling or going out.Anyone who shows symptoms of coronavirus infection must be isolated at home, and their whole household quarantined.Without a vaccine, it seems there is currently no alternative.         The findings show that each person passes the virus on to an average of 2.5 others, and the number of infected people doubles every five days. (Stock image)VIRUS REBOUNDThese rules may be relaxed after five months or so, predict the authors, if the measures cause infection levels to drop.However, the restrictions will need to be re-imposed, perhaps repeatedly, when the virus inevitably returns.This yo-yo process could continue for around 18 months until — it is hoped — an effective vaccine might be produced.WHERE YOU GET ITThe report estimates about a third of transmissions happen in the household, a third in schools and workplaces, and the rest in the wider community.The experts believe that people who catch coronavirus typically incubate the illness for five days before displaying symptoms.They become contagious on average about 12 hours before their symptoms first appear.Each person passes the virus on to an average of 2.5 others, and the number of infected people doubles every five days.About half of those infected show no symptoms, or ones so mild they\u0027re not identified as coronavirus cases. Those who do exhibit symptoms are twice as contagious as those who don\u0027t.Happily, those who recover are currently thought to be immune to re-infection by coronavirus, at least in the short term.DEATH RISKJust under 1 per cent of people who contract coronavirus are expected to die. Around 4.5 per cent of those infected will need to be hospitalised. A third of those people hospitalised will need critical care. Half of those critical-care patients won\u0027t survive.AGE PERILIt is more helpful (though more sobering) to look at how different ages respond to the disease.The older you are, the more likely you are to have serious complications from the virus.The death rate for people:In their 20s is 0.03 per centIn their 30s is 0.08 per centIn their 40s is 0.15 per centIn their 50s is 0.60 per centIn their 60s is 2.2 per centIn their 70s is 5.1 per cent80-plus is 9.3 per centCLOSE SCHOOLS?Experts acknowledge that the most effective way to cut transmission would be to close schools and universities in addition to the other proposed strategies.However, they acknowledge this would present a serious difficulty. Vast numbers of health service staff have children at school, so they would have to take time off work to care for them.That could push the NHS beyond breaking point.GIGS AND SPORTMass events have been put on hold or cancelled. But the report suggests this might not be necessary. \u0027Stopping mass gatherings is predicted to have relatively little impact,\u0027 it says.This is because people spend less time in contact with others at such events compared with at work or in bars or restaurants.WE DON\u0027T KNOW...For all the expertise and computer modelling involved, the authors admit that their report remains only a best guess.\u0027Given that this coronavirus is a newly emergent virus, much remains to be understood about its transmission,\u0027 they say.Predicting epidemics will always involve many unknowns: for example, the virus could eventually mutate and become more or less infectious.Moreover, people can behave in unpredictable ways.Chillingly, the report says: \u0027It is not at all certain that suppression will succeed long term. No public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such a long duration of time.\u0027For now, however, it seems we must seek to do everything we can to suppress this virus, thanks to the report\u0027s essential findings. "},{"url":null,"title":"Joe Biden massive lead Bernie Sanders Florida","story":"Your browser does not support iframes.Share this articleYour browser does not support iframes."},{"url":null,"title":"First giant nature reserve plants animals created size Blackpool","story":"Share this article The nature reserve brings together 11 types of habitat – including lowland heath, valley mires, woodland, coastal sand dunes, lakes and saltmarsh – which will allow wildlife and plants to move out of \u0027micromanaged\u0027 pockets of land to flourish in new areas.Creatures set to benefit include the sand lizard, the Dartford warbler and the silver studded blue butterfly.Having more land to roam gives wildlife a better chance of adapting and thriving in light of the climate crisis.The new super National Nature Reserve combines three existing NNRs at Stoborough Heath, Hartland Moor and Studland and Godlingston Heath, linking them with new land including nature reserves and conservation areas.

Art in the age of Covid-19? Perhaps. But also a call for unity as the nation faces pressure living under the weight of pandemic.With New York City close to a full lockdown, a local photographer has sought to bring a message of love at a difficult time. The Act of Love is a street art campaign across Manhattan and Brooklyn created by Arina Voronova.“While scientists are working on finding a cure for the virus, we, humans, can only spread love and support each other,” said Voronova.While roughly 500 posters have already gone up, 500 more will be distributed across New York this month, according to the artist. She also hopes to shed a light on the discrimination that Asian Americans are experiencing at the moment.“A lot of people won’t even walk through Chinatown right now,” she said. “What does Chinatown in New York City have to do with the virus, when you think about it? It could have started anywhere in the world, but people have this reaction.”“When I walked into an Asian coffee shop the other day, nobody was there,” said Voronova. “The worker said: ‘It is what it is, we can’t do anything about that.’”Jing Fong, the largest Chinese restaurant in New York’s Chinatown temporarily closed last week, while residents and business owners are worried about the long-term impact the discrimination will have on the community.The virus doesn’t have a gender, race or nationality, Voronova stresses. “It’s everywhere,” she adds. “We can only remember we’re all human beings.”It raises the importance of buying locally during the pandemic, rather than from large, corporate companies from ordering takeout from family-run restaurants to getting toilet paper from bodegas.“People, if you’re really freaking out, just support your local businesses,” said the artist. “It’s everyone’s choice how to act during a pandemic but be mindful of where and how you’re doing it.”The social anxiety Americans are experiencing, she says, makes us miss out on simple but important things: “Support, love, kindness and tolerance,” she says. “The project is a reminder to all of us of what being a human is, being able to deal with the current world’s most significant problem with love and sympathy.”It really started with the racism experienced by her Asian American friends. As a result, the artist went searching for face masks for her photo project. But after visiting 23 stores across New York, Voronova couldn’t find any, as there was a shortage (ordering online could involve a months-long wait). But in early February, she found masks in Flushing and hit the streets with her camera.Voronova approached strangers on the streets, mainly couples, but also parents with their children, across several New York neighborhoods. She’d ask: “Do you want to participate in my project?” and offer them the masks to wear, “to support a global community.”“I just wanted to get different people to show New York as the variety it is,” she adds, “all genders, relationships, skin color, all kind of love.”There are over a dozen photos in the series, but Voronova plans on shooting more.

Christie’s off-kilter style presented a peculiarly Canadian perspective on the vast, empty landscape: “My mother claimed that because nature was always trying to kill Canadians it made them different from other people.”The follow-up, Greenwood, is a dense yet exhilarating eco-parable that s a period from the great depression to a bleak prediction of the very near future. But at its heart lies that same Canadian paranoia about the natural world. Harris Greenwood is a lumberman raised during the leanest years of the 1930s, who has made a healthy fortune hacking down swaths of British Columbian forest. His rationale is that even the mighty sequoia are merely “weeds on poles” and that clearing them is a necessary, pre-emptive form of self-defence. “You think trees are sacred, that they love you. That they grow for your enjoyment. But those who really know trees know they’re also ruthless. They’ve been fighting a war for sunlight and sustenance since before we existed.”Over the generations the Greenwood lumber empire has diminished as catastrophically as the forests it plundered. The decline begins with Harris’s ill-advised deal to supply railway sleepers to Japan shortly before the outbreak of the second world war. Later his estranged adopted daughter Willow gains posthumous revenge by handing her entire inheritance to a chaotic hippie collective in the 70s. Her son Liam is left to scrape a living as an artisan carpenter, crafting increasingly scarce reclaimed wood into boardroom tables. But the opening chapters of the novel are set in 2038, and feature Liam’s daughter Jacinda Greenwood (known as Jake) a graduate dendrologist with a mountain of student debt living in a world almost entirely devoid of trees.Christie posits a world attempting to recover from an ecological catastrophe known as the Great Withering, during which rising temperatures unleashed a virulent new strain of fungus that destroys trees. The lack of a forest canopy causes soils to dry up, creating “killer dust clouds as fine as all-purpose flour”. The world is left swarming with desperate climate refugees, many suffering from “rib-retch” a lethal, hacking cough that “snaps ribs like kindling”.In the new world order, the Canadian prime minster emerges as the most powerful woman on earth, with the vast and, in places, still-green country functioning as “a global panic room for the world’s elite”. Jake finds herself working as a vastly over-qualified tour guide at a Pacific island re-branded as the “Greenwood Arboreal Cathedral”: an exclusive resort where the super-rich take therapeutic breaks in one of the world’s last surviving old-growth forests. “They come to be reminded that the earth’s once-thundering green heart has not flatlined, that it isn’t too late and all is not lost. They come here to the Greenwood Arboreal Cathedral to ingest this outrageous lie, and it’s Jake Greenwood’s job as Forest Guide to spoon-feed it to them.”The speculative episodes contain the most arresting and bleakly realised passages of the book, but they form merely the outer perimeter of a layered narrative constructed like the growth rings of a giant redwood. The scale of Christie’s ambition becomes apparent when the novel goes head-to-head with the greatest dust-bowl narrative ever told. The allusions to The Grapes of Wrath are far from hidden – Liam Greenwood observes the hipster clientele of a Brooklyn cafe “in their old-time canvas aprons, linen work shirts and perfectly distressed boots like they’ve stepped out of the pages of a Steinbeck novel”. But the sections set in the 30s resound with authentically Steinbeckian cadences, albeit slightly modified in vocabulary: “Smothering dusters scoured the lead paint from the barn and house, leaving great swaths of pinewood as white as a farmer’s bared ass.”Every generation produces prophets convinced that the age we are living in will be the last. Yet who in the present climate can confidently dismiss as fiction Christie’s depiction of “the quaint period before the Withering when people still believed that well-intended, measured engagement could avert catastrophe”? Perhaps the most prescient sections of the book are those that depict the dawn of climate activism in the 70s. Jake’s feckless grandmother Willow is among the original tribe of earth-warriors yet saving trees is to her as much a self-conscious pose as cultivating underarm hair and a lentil diet. “Why is it, she wonders casually, that we expect our children to be the ones to halt deforestation and to rescue the planet tomorrow when we are the ones overseeing its destruction today?”Christie’s book predicts a horribly plausible ecological Armageddon and though it may not be the first to suggest that the opportunity to avert catastrophe has already passed, its great summation could well be the old Chinese proverb that Willow is fond of quoting: “The best time to plant a tree is always 20 years ago. And the second-best time is always now.”• Greenwood is published by Scribe (RRP £16.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

From Wednesday, Sainsbury’s will also be restricting shoppers to buying a maximum of three items of any grocery product and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk. Previously Sainsbury’s had limited customers to five items of the most popular products.Coupe said: “We have enough food coming into the system, but are limiting sales so that it stays on shelves for longer and can be bought by a larger number of customers.”Sainsbury’s tighter restrictions are expected to be followed by other supermarket chains as many shelves lie empty across the UK. Over the weekend, shortages extended beyond toilet roll, canned food and pasta to fresh meat, flour, frozen vegetables, eggs, sugar and teabags.Aldi has introduced a four items per shopper limit on all products, and Tesco cut its limit from five to two items over the weekend on products including toilet roll, long-life milk, pasta and tissues. Industry insiders said all supermarkets were likely to extend these limits to more products and potentially reduce the maximum number of items each shopper can buy.The restrictions will not be centrally coordinated by the industry as doing so would breach competition regulations. Insiders said government-backed restrictions would take too long to implement and not be sufficiently responsive.One industry source said there was not complete agreement on whether restrictions would help. They said: “There can be a problem of people going to shops more often, swapping one big shop for several small shops.”As they try to keep up with demand, supermarkets are also expected to reduce the range of products on offer, with options such as wholemeal organic pasta disappearing and potential reductions in options such as single pints of milk instead of two- or four-pint bottles.Waitrose, Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have also called on hundreds of head office staff to help out in stores as they struggle to tackle queues. About 600 John Lewis and head office staff have been drafted into Waitrose outlets, and Morrisons said 500 head office workers were now working in its distribution centres and stores.Waitrose is also asking store workers in 40 outlets to recommend friends and family who can help out for about a month.In a call with the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, George Eustice, on Tuesday, retail bosses are also understood to have discussed ways to protect elderly and vulnerable shoppers.Some chains, including Iceland, have already set aside a couple of hours for older and more vulnerable shoppers to use their stores exclusively. Sainsbury’s said it would set aside the first hour of trading in all stores on Thursday this week for the elderly and vulnerable and would be giving priority to online orders from those over 70 and the disabled. From next week Morrisons is introducing three food parcel options, which can be ordered by phone for home delivery. The Bradford-based chain is recruiting about 2,500 pickers and drivers to meet demand for home delivery via its online store and Amazon.The grocery industry is preparing for a busy period – which could last months – after the shift towards home working this week, and the government’s advice to avoid restaurants, cafes and bars has also led to a rise in home catering.In recent days, demand for fresh produce has surged as people shift from takeaway sandwiches or lunch in the staff canteen to eating at home. In usual circumstances, dining out or takeaways make up about a third of what we eat.Fresh produce companies said there was currently no problem with supplies from Spain, where much of the UK’s fresh salad and vegetables come from at this time of year.But there have been some delays in deliveries to the UK as drivers are not keen to leave their home countries, while border crossings have taken longer because of restrictions on movement.

The European Central Bank has slapped down one of its own governing council members, Austria’s top central banker, after he suggested monetary policy was running low on gas.In an interview with Austria’s Der Standard, Robert Holzmann suggested the ECB was at its limits and markets were expecting too much from policymakers. Asked about the slump in shares and Italian bonds following last week’s ECB meeting, Holzmann said: We cannot solve the problem on our own, it is now primarily a matter of fiscal policy. It is the state’s responsibility to provide liability and social support.Monetary policy cannot cover up the problem. Holzmann also suggested the crisis could have a ‘cleansing’ impact, clearing out failing companies and making the economy (eventually) stronger:This has prompted a rare public rebuttal from the ECB, which says:With regards to comments made by Governor Holzmann, the ECB states:The Governing Council was unanimous in its analysis that in addition to the measures it decided on 12 March 2020, the ECB will continue to monitor closely the consequences for the economy of the spreading coronavirus and that the ECB stands ready to adjust all of its measures, as appropriate, should this be needed to safeguard liquidity conditions in the banking system and to ensure the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions.What more could the UK government do to help companies?One idea, being pushed by business groups, is to reverse the national insurance scheme - to inject cash back into struggling firms.Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, which represents some of the country’s biggest employers, believes it could have an immediate impact.“This is about using existing systems, it’s all about speed,” Fairbairn told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“So the thought that we have put to the chancellor is to reverse national insurance contributions, not just defer or cancel them, but actually get the flow working in the other direction.”Fairbairn said that Germany is using a similar system, which is already up and running. Here’s our round-up of today’s profit warnings from across Europe, as the coronavirus downturn deepens:Chemist chain Boots says products needed by customers during the coronavirus crisis will soon be available again in stores, as their supply chain reacts to increased demand.Sebastian James, the chief executive of Boots, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that products including hand sanitiser, paracetamol, pain relief, baby products and cleaning products should be flowing more freely.“504 lines are very much in demand at the moment in our stores, we are are getting more every day, it’s a little and often, we ship to our stores every single day, sometimes twice a day.”James said Boots, which has around 2,400 shops in the UK, was asking shoppers to buy only what they needed for their family, to make sure products were available for others. Of course, Italy may need to issue a lot more government debt to finance the cost of its coronavirus response. That would typically push down prices, and push up yields (As Rome would need to offer a better interest rate to encourage demand).But the scale and speed of the moves are rather concerning. The old eurozone debt crisis problems are resurfacing.Yesterday, Italian PM Giuseppe Conte called for special “coronavirus bonds” or a European guarantee fund to help member states finance urgent health and economic policies.German chancellor Angela Merkel didn’t not rule it out, saying no decision had been made - but it’s not clear that Berlin has dropped its long opposition to shared borrowing.Michael Strobaek, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse, suggests investors should keep to the sidelines, saying (via the FT): “The jury is still out on whether these measures will help stabilise financial markets.”Investors are also aware that this isn’t a repeat of 2008. It’s actually the reverse - the real economy is hurting the financial sector, not the other way round.As Kit Juckes of Société Générale wisely explains:2008 was a crisis born in shadow banking that exposed how over-leveraged the financial sector had become and for many banks, including large ones, over-dependence on short-term funding was a major weakness which, in turn, caused liquidity to dry up. The banks were in the front line of the crisis.This time (economic) front line in the crisis, is the damage the pandemic is wreaking on companies in exposed sectors and on the economy more widely as the crisis spreads. So while market participants scramble de-leverage, the banks need money to lend to companies whose cashflow situation has changed almost overnight.That need for funds to flow into the economy isn’t going away any time soon. The result is that while direct financial effects of this crisis might be less acute than in 08, they will continue being felt for a long time. Over in Lisbon, the Portuguese government has announced a €9.2bn coronavirus economic package.It includes €3bn of government-backed credit guarantees, €1bn for social security payments, and a €5.2bn fiscal stimulus, Reuters reports.As markets shrug at yesterday’s £350bn economic rescue plan, the UK government has suggested it could take further action - which could include more help for employeesSpeaking on the Today programme, business secretary Alok Sharma said the proposals put forward by the chancellor had been well-received by groups including the CBI, but confirmed that more action would be needed.“I completely understand that people want us to go further, particularly on this issue of support for employees, for employment... The chancellor was very clear that this is a conversation he and I are having with employers and trade unions, and we’ll come forward in the coming days with further measures.”While not ruling out direct payments to workers, Sharma said that the government was “looking at using the current system and how we can get that support very quickly into businesses.”“The principle is that yes we will get support to businesses for employees measures specifically”.Asked if businesses could be relied on to pass money from grants and loans onto employees, rather than prioritising creditors or other payments he said: “The vast amount of businesses want to operate, they will behave sensibly, but I completely get this point about measures specifically for employees and employment and we will come forward with those.”The coronavirus crisis has forced Selfridges,the high-end department chain, to shut its stores in London, Manchester and Birmingham will close from 7pm tonight.Selfridges flagship store on Oxford Street is one of the capital’s landmark retail sites, so this shows the scale of the retail downturn. My colleague Zoe Wood suspects other will soon follow....Investment bank Jefferies has welcomed Rishi Sunak’s £330bn stimulus package, saying it will help the UK economy recover.Such quarterly declines in GDP are unprecedented, certainly in living memory, and will lead to further corporate failures and economic hardship. However, today’s announcements should be seen as further important steps to help address the substantial economic costs of effectively shutting down economies, and a further move towards substantial fiscal easing and rising government debt across many economies. But Jefferies does still expect “a significant bounce-back in activity”, eventually, as this chart shows:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64b20d0aaf6b13cbddcbeff236bec88b83c387c1/0_199_5710_3428/master/5710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ba23a792bc95ca7fd3bf6cd8918fbfd","title":"democratic race joe biden 2020 bernie sanders","story":"There is no reason for Sanders to stay in this race, no matter how fervent his fans. It’s Biden who will unify us This Democratic race isn’t pining for the fjords. It is no more. It has ceased to be. Its metabolic processes are now history. This is an ex-presidential contest.The only reason the news networks could not call the Florida primary as soon as the votes piled up for Joe Biden was because the state’s panhandle voters were still at the polls. Once those polls closed, the obvious was made official: it was a blowout for Biden.The last time we heard from Bernie Sanders after losing big in the last round of primaries, he said he wanted to debate the former vice-president head-to-head, one-on-one, to press his case directly and finally.“While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,” Sanders said the day after his Super Tuesday defeats. “Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen. On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.”Well the American people had that opportunity and they chose Joe Biden. If this is what winning the ideological debate looks like, Sanders should seriously consider debating another topic.Just one week ago, Bernie Sanders pledged to fight on, at a time when he was losing the delegate count by around 100 attendees of the Democratic convention. Judging from the projected vote counts on Tuesday, that delegate deficit just tripled.There is no reason for Sanders to stay in this race, no matter how fervent his fans and no matter how passionately he wants to advocate for his policies. He has spent the last four years advocating for those policies, pushing the Democratic party towards his ideas to remarkable effect.Back in the 2008 election and Barack Obama’s first term, it was unthinkable to propose a public healthcare option: the defeat of Clinton’s healthcare proposals was still too raw, more than a decade after they had failed. Today all the Democratic contenders proposed a public option, and Joe Biden’s healthcare policies are far to the left of Obama’s.Mission accomplished? Apparently not. Bernie’s advisers say Biden hasn’t done enough to unify the party, or generate voter enthusiasm.By any measure, Biden can feel confident in turning towards the general election and, more importantly, beyond that: to the historic challenge of pulling this country, and the rest of the world, out of a pandemic and global recession. It’s unlikely that he will agree to another debate with Sanders.The pandemic is only accelerating the process that was first set in train by South Carolina’s Democrats. State by state, poll by poll, Democrats – and voters in general – are saying that Biden is best placed to handle a crisis, and to unify the country. Those are not small issues at a time of multiple, historic challenges.Biden himself addressed the nation via live-stream from his Delaware home, standing at a podium in front of two American flags. If it was indeed Biden’s home, he has a strange taste in interior styling.Most of what Biden said was not a victory speech but the words of someone trying to reassure and rally a country being shaken to its core. “Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war,” Biden explained. “Yes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it’s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as iniduals are going to collectively impact what happens.”He praised the public officials who allowed the voting to take place while supposedly protecting public health. And he praised Bernie’s young voters for their enthusiasm and commitment, urging them to rally together with his campaign. “I hear you,” he told them. “I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.”He may not actually know what those young Sanders voters want – or he may not be prepared to adopt their agenda in full. But he was prepared to strike a patriotic note of national unity. “This is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us,” Biden said. “To believe in one another.”There will surely come a time for another, younger Sanders-like leader to press for a political revolution that overhauls America’s economy and social safety net. If this recession plays out like the last one, voters of all kinds will be hungrier than ever for radical change in four years’ time.That leader may already be well-known to American voters: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will have just turned 35 – the constitutional minimum age of a president – by the time of the next presidential election. Bernie’s ideas will live on long after his presidential campaign ends, which it should do within days, if he is serious about wanting the Democrats to defeat Donald Trump."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254e859668a7ba5069ffd9df6d4ec03e8f6de15e/0_216_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e29160347c458ba00443dca6fa56a3b1","title":"british democracy tested law freedoms survive","story":"The coming months will be the closest many have come to living under martial law. But our freedoms will survive • See all our coronavirus coverageAn old Russian friend teases me when I complain about British politics. He finds my tales of Westminster negligence and dysfunction touchingly insipid. When I described pro-European trauma on the morning after the Brexit referendum, he shot back: “At least you all went to bed not knowing what the result was going to be.”The morning after Russia’s most recent presidential election in 2018, no one woke up surprised that Vladimir Putin had won. The result did raise a question of how the incumbent would get around constitutional term limits that should exclude his candidacy in 2024. The solution was revealed last week in a proposal to rewrite the rules. The clock will be reset so Putin can run again and again. The arrangements will be ratified in a referendum, on the eve of which no Russian will go to bed unsure about the result.To oppose Putin in a polling booth is futile, and less secluded action is potentially dangerous. There is a great Russian tradition of defying authoritarian rule, but it proceeds by the slow-burn propulsion of endurance and martyrdom. If the regime has brittleness I am not qualified to measure it. That was hard enough when I lived in Moscow and I know better than to tackle Kremlin enigmas with an out-of-date code book.My Russian is a bit rusty, too. But I have not forgotten the feeling of a society submerged in mistrust of politics. Communist rule laid deep foundations of cynicism. The Party failed to provide people with the goods and rights they craved, so instead penalised the craving itself as decadent and seditious. Post-Soviet transition swapped the caprice of ideological bullies for lawless gangsterism. The idea of democracy was discredited by the chaos. Justice felt no less arbitrary than before, with the added indignity of losing the USSR’s superpower status.Putin exploited that trauma, casting himself as the guarantor of stability and macho incarnation of national self-confidence. On that ticket he could still have been competitive in elections without all the intimidation and state propaganda but he didn’t take any chances.That political evolution has bred contempt for the idea of public service through elected office. It promotes a jaundiced view of motive, seeing the darkest intent behind any official deed, presuming that the truest analysis is the one that unearths the most malicious plan via the most convoluted conspiracy. And because democracy did not flourish in Russia it must be ridiculed abroad. To suggest that western politicians ever try to do the right thing, or that bad outcomes can be accidental, invites derision.The taste of that embitterment is not easily forgotten. I recognised it as it seeped into Britain – a familiar credulous cynicism that will believe fairytales if they are shared in a paranoid whisper, branded as secrets that shadowy powers do not want you to know. The BBC covers up the truth Brussels funds the opposition Zionists pull the strings. This stuff is acrid and endemic online, stirred up by international troll battalions and extremist provocateurs. It corrodes the base of common facts, churning up the level ground on which liberal, pluralist institutions can build consent for government.That mechanism has been weaponised by the Kremlin. It works by persuading citizens in functioning democracies that their own governments are no better than authoritarian ones, and just as worthy of contempt. It is depressing to see it working, when British citizens denigrate their institutions the way Russians dismiss theirs, complaining as if our own elections are hardly less fraudulent than the ones that keep Putin in office.It is hardest to praise democracy when its output is unwelcome. Noisy pro-European campaigners hated the referendum result so much they rejected claims that political trust would be undermined by aborting Brexit, although many quieter former remain voters felt the job had to be seen through. Fans of Jeremy Corbyn want to believe that the rightwing media hypnotised the working class out of affection for socialism, although the Labour leader needed no help repelling voters. There is much to repair in Britain’s electoral machinery, from the voting system to the poor invigilation of campaign finance. Its hinges creak with anachronism, but it is not a sham.To affirm that faith invites charges of naivety or complacency. History counsels vigilance and the imagination can always plot a curve from ministerial misadventure towards dictatorship. Any slope away from ideal practice can be made to look slippery. The coming months dealing with Covid-19 will test our liberal political culture in unfamiliar ways. Parliament will struggle to function emergency powers will resemble the draconian expedients of war. It is the closest most of us will come to living under martial law. The pausing of freedoms we have long taken for granted can be tolerable only if we believe they can survive hibernation.The government response has not always radiated competence. We do not know how the economy or our institutions will cope. Emergency laws expose tensions between liberty and security and it is essential to guard against casual disposal of fundamental rights. It is also important to resist the excesses of anti-political mania common to fire-breathing radicals on the left and right alike, who point at democracy’s imperfections and call them tyranny.Boris Johnson is deeply flawed, dishonest and cavalier, but not a thief or a murderer. His unserious style doesn’t suit the gravity of the moment, but he is a creature of British political tradition and not a despot. Those who hate seeing him in Downing Street can be consoled by the knowledge that he is not our prime minister for life. Despair at election results is tempered by the belief that other outcomes were genuinely possible. There is democratic privilege hidden in political disappointment, so long as it comes with an element of surprise.In authoritarian regimes there is no consensual management of freedoms. They are bestowed or withdrawn from on high. Putin adorns his power with the symbols of democracy – elections and court rulings – but he does it out of contempt for the real thing. The Kremlin-issued facsimile cannot replicate the intricacy and delicacy of a truly democratic system, entrenched in culture, assembled from millions of interlocking parts. Laws and parliaments are the scaffolding that support countless civic acts, each one affirming the faith that ours is a political system that exists for the benefit of the people, not a conspiracy against them. Anyone who has lived under both types of government can easily tell the difference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9fe81612012282789c221a7066a1cba9ad99e22/0_70_4524_2714/master/4524.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=265f71c19d3c7f78019a00d829bdac40","title":"coronavirus europe shock tools to recover","story":"Governments are scrambling to reimpose old borders but we, European citizens, should launch our own solidarity networkEurope has become the global centre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. In France, where I am writing from, President Macron has put the country in a “health war” lockdown. Cafes, restaurants, theatres, public parks are closed and all non-essential activities have stopped. In living memory there’s never been anything like this: under Nazi occupation, as we know, Paris culture and nightlife kept functioning rather well. Covid-19 is upon us now, and many of our continent’s large cities feel like they’re fast sliding into one of those dystopian movie scripts with empty streets, face masks, surgical gloves and self-isolation the new normal.With hospital emergency units bracing themselves for much worse yet to come, it feels almost irrelevant to dwell on what this moment says about our place in the world as Europeans, or which feelings we are able to muster – or not – for one another and for others overseas. Postwar Europe’s institutional set-up was meant to epitomise international cooperation and solidarity, and to set a form of global example in the process. Will any of that survive now as countries start to wall themselves in? And what can we citizens do about it?After Donald Trump signalled last week that the US wanted to de facto seal itself off from Europe, I remembered an oped by two of his senior team members published in 2017. “The world is not a ‘global community’, but an arena where nations ... compete for advantage,” they’d written. With Covid-19, that “arena” is put into even sharper focus. And nationalist reflexes are hardly a Trumpian monopoly these days. (Reports that Trump offered a German biopharmaceutical company a fat sum of money to secure a vaccine exclusively for the US only added to a general go-it-alone picture.)There isn’t much official coordination or sticking-together on display in Europe itself. National governments, including Germany’s, have sealed their national borders to neighbouring states or are increasing controls. The rationale for much of this can be mind-boggling. Borders don’t stop the virus. Some of what’s at work is that rightwing populist credos have in recent years infected entire swaths of our continent’s politics. For them, there is only one single measure of collective self-identification and solidarity: the ethno-national level. Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, to take an example, lost no time holding “foreigners” responsible for the pandemic.As events spiralled and with the death count mounting, I wondered about empathy and solidarity: what triggers them? What does a pandemic crisis say about our capacity for such feelings and modes of action? And could grassroots, citizens’ initiatives possibly course-correct some of the egoism of states?In his book Ordinary Virtues, Michael Ignatieff quotes a speech Eleanor Roosevelt gave at the United Nations in 1958. She was speaking about human rights conventions, but the gist of her text can apply to the notion of human solidarity at large. “Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home – so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Yet they are the world of the inidual person ... Without concerted citizen action … we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.”Being the global centre of the pandemic means we in Europe hold a specific responsibility in the way we react to this situation, and in how we behave also towards others beyond our shores. Perhaps it helps to think a bit about how we approached the climate crisis as a collective cause for mobilisation (think of the Paris climate agreement). Why couldn’t we now clearly identify Covid-19 as another danger that needs to be addressed collectively – and take up the task as citizens to make that message loud and clear? However different, both these perils have this in common: they transcend all national boundaries and they threaten lives. The “us” versus “them” logic of nationalists and populists becomes absurd in the face of these phenomena.So here’s a question. While governments scramble, is it too early to think of launching a Europe-wide citizens’ online campaign for solidarity in the age of the coronavirus? Could people create a movement that says, let’s help each other as much as we can, and in ways that cut across the national ides many of our governments are resorting to?Videos of Italians in lockdown singing from their balconies to keep their spirits up have been admirable. Could some of that gusto spread and morph into a Europe-wide flurry of videos chanting our empathy and willingness to show solidarity with one another? Wherever we may live and whatever language we may speak, sending that kind of message across our “Corona-centre” continent would hold special meaning, surely not just for ourselves now, but for others also, and perhaps for the future as well.To be sure, for the moment we are stunned by the shock of what’s unfolding and bewildered by what is yet heading our way. Also, still too many people seem confused or in a form of denial as to the exact extent of what we’re facing. Until just days ago, some people in Paris thought best to keep partying, or to attend crowded public protests. Likewise in Ireland, videos of people celebrating in packed bars last weekend have caused outrage.Trust in institutions and resistance to fake news are being put to the test. Pessimists will say our European capacity to come together and show generosity, or even elementary openness to others, has already been entirely blunted by the crises of the past decade (our numbness to Syria’s killing fields is, to me, the greatest case in point). We are no doubt now in severe, introspective, fear-and-fragmentation European mode.But for those who still believe we can be a community of a kind, and that our continental space (or the world beyond) should not be turned into an “arena”, now is the time to ask ourselves how we will want to look back at this phase of our collective history. How will we want future generations to look back at us, and what kind of message do we want to send to the rest of the world? And please note, with every mention of Europe I include the UK. We are one continent, and the virus is among us all. Discord or “social distancing” among nation-states makes no sense in the face of an invisible enemy in our midst which makes no distinction about its victims.And look around: ordinary virtues aren’t absent at all. Gestures of empathy and solidarity are multiplying at a local level – medical students volunteering to help hospitals, or neighbours helping the elderly get food. Why not invent something symbolically similar at a wider, transnational level, and by making use of digital tools? Politicians have done little of this. But citizens can show the way.Artists, creators, start-ups, activists, anyone or any network that’s part of the fabric that binds us together in beautiful, meaningful ways under ordinary circumstances, could take a stand for cross-border solidarity in these extraordinary circumstances. Scientists and medics are of course sharing and coming together. Why not extend that to other parts of our societies? It’s obvious that our only chance to somehow mitigate this catastrophe is to act together, or at least to act in ways that are closely attentive to others, not blind or negligent towards them.Many of us are now hunkering down at home, and it’s all but natural that we focus on immediate day-to-day needs, the health of loved ones, saving our work or our livelihoods, in our entirely up-ended lives. But if our claims to human empathy have any meaning at all, then now is a good time to think of building up a pan-European chorus of voices for solidarity. Sure, it won’t in itself bring us any closer to a vaccine, nor immunise us against the virus, but it could help immunise us against something else – the nasty undercurrents of nationalism that are lurking under the surface. As we Europeans stand at the epicentre of it all, it’s up to us to make solidarity viral.

We were given repeated assurances in emails and through student governmental organizations that our residence halls would not close. At the time, students, parents and government officials praised NYU for its decision to suspend classes, which we saw as a step toward “flattening the curve”.We were encouraged to leave campus for spring break and to take additional belongings with us in case a significant amount of time passed before our next return to campus. Out of an abundance of caution I chose not to go home for spring break to prevent potentially exposing family members to Covid-19 in case I had been exposed and was not yet symptomatic.Over the past few days, the roughly 12,000 students living in the NYU housing system saw the situation escalate around us and heard nothing from administrators. On Monday afternoon we received an email saying the residence halls would be closing on 22 March. We were told all students must vacate their rooms by the 22nd, or within 48 hours if possible.Students who already left campus and did not prepare their rooms for checkout have been strongly encouraged to return to New York, collect their belongings then return home. Regarding those unable to return to New York before the closure date, the university has said only that their items will be packed and shipped to them. We have not been given a timeframe for when this might happen, nor have the obvious privacy concerns been addressed.The university has created an online form for students to submit applications for emergency financial aid, though the form states that requests over $500 will not be considered. The office of residential life and housing services has said it will offer pro-rated refunds for housing fees for the rest of the semester but has failed to give details of any sort or offer any kind of time frame for when we can expect these refunds. We have been told that a very limited number of exceptions to the eviction policy will be made the email announcing the closure says “the bar will be very high”.In its lack of communication and lack of consultation of students, NYU has consistently dropped the ball. This crisis will worst affect students who don’t have any home to return to, are not willing to risk their immigration status in the US to return home, or are unable to return home for fear that they might infect high-risk family members.The university administration’s refusal to provide us with any details has exacerbated anxieties that were already near a breaking point and it leaves me and many others in search of answers: why has NYU chosen to evict us in the middle of a pandemic, and during a moratorium on evictions? What caused the reversal, and why was no one consulted?The student-led NYU Inter-Residence Hall Council released a statement last night demanding answers to these questions and giving NYU 24 hours to respond. At the time of writing the university has not responded and students who call the university housing hotline hear a looped recording. The university has also failed to respond to a petition to reconsider its eviction decision at the time of writing the petition has 4,873 signatures.As students we do not believe we are asking the university to undertake some exorbitantly taxing effort. We simply want answers and clarity. We implore the administration to reconsider advising students to violate CDC guidelines and return to the city to clear out rooms for a purpose that is currently unknown. If NYU truly is the kind of institution it presents itself to be, the absolute least they owe us is an explanation. We are people, not just NYU ID numbers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8762ecbc4ba710dfd833da31d24ed637757941/0_212_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b2831feaf8675dcfc087edc7fc9541b","title":"cambridge colleges criticised for asking students to leave over coronavirus","story":"International staff and students report panic after receiving contradictory advice on whether to leave their collegesCambridge lecturers have criticised the university’s colleges for provoking “wide-scale panic” among international students and staff by urging them to return to their home countries due to the coronavirus pandemic.The condemnation from the local branch of the University and College Union (UCU) came after international students complained they had been bombarded with “aggressive” emails asking them to leave their colleges at short notice.The president of Cambridge UCU, Jennifer Marchant, warned that the advice put overseas students from countries with weaker healthcare systems at risk and would exacerbate the global spread of Covid-19.In a letter to the central university and college masters, Marchant wrote: “We are extremely concerned that the invitation to leave the country at such short notice, when most countries are closing their borders, will dramatically affect the most economically and socially vulnerable members of the college community who cannot afford to leave the UK at the last minute, who do not have healthcare coverage in their country of origin, who simply have nowhere else to go, and do not have clear instructions on how leaving will impact their visa status.“Furthermore, we are concerned that some students and staff come from countries … with a much weaker healthcare system than the UK, and travelling right now would only contribute to further spreading of the pandemic.”The UCU also criticised the confusing and contradictory advice issued by the colleges and the central university, and called on them to offer financial help to international students who were returning to their home countries and put in place safety measures for those unable to leave.On Friday the vice-chancellor, Prof Stephen Toope, sent an email to all students advising against international travel. He wrote: “At this point in the outbreak, we must also be mindful of the risk of inadvertently spreading the disease to other less-affected countries.”But an email from the senior tutor and principal of Newnham college sent on 15 March advised students to “make plans to leave your college accommodation by 19 March at the very latest and earlier if possible” unless it is “truly your home”.A director of studies at Cambridge, who wished to remain anonymous, said the messages to students from different colleges he had seen shared the “same cold-blooded and brutal core message, basically we really don’t want you here”.He added that international students and those from Northern Ireland had been put in a position of having to find flights “at very short notice and so at high cost”. “Colleges are very protective of their students in the good times but it now appears that in times of crisis they look after themselves.”Marina Veličković, a PhD student at Pembroke college, said she had to scramble to get home to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as many flights were being cancelled. She said her college’s handling of the situation had been irresponsible and panic-inducing.In a Twitter thread, Veličković complained that the college had told international students not to leave two weeks ago, when travel could have posed less risk of spreading the virus, then abruptly changed its position.An international student at St John’s college, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “The colleges are being inconsistent and alarmist. What disturbs me most is the callous approach and the panic they have created.“In some cases they’ve asked students to pack up everything and move out completely in two or three days. The fact that they have sent so many emails essentially means they’re forcing people out by inducing so much panic.“Some of my friends are considering leaving, and I really doubt they would be safe in international airports or back home where more cases are erupting at this time.”In a message to students on Tuesday, the vice chancellor said that if the university moved from its current amber alert on the coronavirus to the more serious red alert that students still in Cambridge will be asked to return home, or “on an exceptional basis, will be accommodated and supported by colleges if they cannot”.He added: “Already foreign governments are closing their borders to all but their own nationals, and students are strongly advised to make their plans accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587cd58783794ce520fc729ff7e604c83f3562a4/63_52_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7872702e318abdab904e6489780df11","title":"tip of the iceberg is our destruction of nature responsible for covid 19 aoe","story":"As habitat and bioersity loss increase globally, the coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemicsMayibout 2 is not a healthy place. The 150 or so people who live in the village, which sits on the south bank of the Ivindo River, deep in the great Minkebe Forest in northern Gabon, are used to occasional bouts of diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever and sleeping sickness. Mostly they shrug them off.But in January 1996, Ebola, a deadly virus then barely known to humans, unexpectedly spilled out of the forest in a wave of small epidemics. The disease killed 21 of 37 villagers who were reported to have been infected, including a number who had carried, skinned, chopped or eaten a chimpanzee from the nearby forest.I travelled to Mayibout 2 in 2004 to investigate why deadly diseases new to humans were emerging from bioersity “hotspots” such as tropical rainforests and bushmeat markets in African and Asian cities.Villagers told me how children had gone into the forest with dogs that had killed the chimp. They said that everyone who cooked or ate it got a terrible fever within a few hours. Some died immediately, while others were taken down the river to hospital. A few, like Nesto Bematsick, recovered. “We used to love the forest, now we fear it,” he told me. Many of Bematsick’s family members died.Only a decade or two ago it was widely thought that tropical forests and intact natural environments teeming with exotic wildlife threatened humans by harbouring the viruses and pathogens that lead to new diseases in humans such as Ebola, HIV and dengue.But a number of researchers today think that it is actually humanity’s destruction of bioersity that creates the conditions for new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19, the viral disease that emerged in China in December 2019, to arise – with profound health and economic impacts in rich and poor countries alike. In fact, a new discipline, planetary health, is emerging that focuses on the increasingly visible connections between the wellbeing of humans, other living things and entire ecosystems.Is it possible, then, that it was human activity, such as road building, mining, hunting and logging, that triggered the Ebola epidemics in Mayibout 2 and elsewhere in the 1990s and that is unleashing new terrors today?“We invade tropical forests and other wild landscapes, which harbour so many species of animals and plants – and within those creatures, so many unknown viruses,” David Quammen, author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Pandemic, recently wrote in the New York Times. “We cut the trees we kill the animals or cage them and send them to markets. We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts. When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.”Research suggests that outbreaks of animal-borne and other infectious diseases such as Ebola, Sars, bird flu and now Covid-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, are on the rise. Pathogens are crossing from animals to humans, and many are able to spread quickly to new places. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that three-quarters of new or emerging diseases that infect humans originate in animals.Some, like rabies and plague, crossed from animals centuries ago. Others, such as Marburg, which is thought to be transmitted by bats, are still rare. A few, like Covid-19, which emerged last year in Wuhan, China, and Mers, which is linked to camels in the Middle East, are new to humans and spreading globally.Other diseases that have crossed into humans include Lassa fever, which was first identified in 1969 in Nigeria Nipah from Malaysia and Sars from China, which killed more than 700 people and travelled to 30 countries in 2002–03. Some, like Zika and West Nile virus, which emerged in Africa, have mutated and become established on other continents.Kate Jones, chair of ecology and bioersity at UCL, calls emerging animal-borne infectious diseases an “increasing and very significant threat to global health, security and economies”.Increasingly, says Jones, these zoonotic diseases are linked to environmental change and human behaviour. The disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, she says.The resulting transmission of disease from wildlife to humans, she says, is now “a hidden cost of human economic development. There are just so many more of us, in every environment. We are going into largely undisturbed places and being exposed more and more. We are creating habitats where viruses are transmitted more easily, and then we are surprised that we have new ones.”Jones studies how changes in land use contribute to the risk. “We are researching how species in degraded habitats are likely to carry more viruses which can infect humans,” she says. “Simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.”The difference between now and a few decades ago, Fevre says, is that diseases are likely to spring up in both urban and natural environments. “We have created densely packed populations where alongside us are bats and rodents and birds, pets and other living things. That creates intense interaction and opportunities for things to move from species to species,” he says.“Pathogens do not respect species boundaries,” says disease ecologist Thomas Gillespie, an associate professor in Emory University’s  department of  environmental  sciences, who studies how shrinking natural habitats and changing behaviour add to the risk of diseases spilling over from animals to humans.“I am not at all surprised about the coronavirus outbreak,” he says. “The majority of pathogens are still to be discovered. We are at the very tip of the iceberg.”Humans, says Gillespie, are creating the conditions for the spread of diseases by reducing the natural barriers between host animals – in which the virus is naturally circulating – and themselves. “We fully expect the arrival of pandemic influenza we can expect large-scale human mortalities we can expect other pathogens with other impacts. A disease like Ebola is not easily spread. But something with a mortality rate of Ebola spread by something like measles would be catastrophic,” Gillespie says.Wildlife everywhere is being put under more stress, he says. “Major landscape changes are causing animals to lose habitats, which means species become crowded together and also come into greater contact with humans. Species that survive change are now moving and mixing with different animals and with humans.”Gillespie sees this in the US, where suburbs fragment forests and raise the risk of humans contracting Lyme disease. “Altering the ecosystem affects the complex cycle of the Lyme pathogen. People living close by are more likely to get bitten by a tick carrying Lyme bacteria,” he says.Yet human health research seldom considers the surrounding natural ecosystems, says Richard Ostfeld, distinguished senior scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. He and others are developing the emerging discipline of planetary health, which looks at the links between human and ecosystem health.“There’s misapprehension among scientists and the public that natural ecosystems are the source of threats to ourselves. It’s a mistake. Nature poses threats, it is true, but it’s human activities that do the real damage. The health risks in a natural environment can be made much worse when we interfere with it,” he says.Felicia Keesing, professor of biology at Bard College, New York, studies how environmental changes influence the probability that humans will be exposed to infectious diseases. “When we erode bioersity, we see a proliferation of the species most likely to transmit new diseases to us, but there’s also good evidence that those same species are the best hosts for existing diseases,” she wrote in an email to Ensia, the nonprofit media outlet that reports on our changing planet.Disease ecologists argue that viruses and other pathogens are also likely to move from animals to humans in the many informal markets that have sprung up to provide fresh meat to fast-growing urban populations around the world. Here, animals are slaughtered, cut up and sold on the spot.The “wet market” (one that sells fresh produce and meat) in Wuhan, thought by the Chinese government to be the starting point of the current Covid-19 pandemic, was known to sell numerous wild animals, including live wolf pups, salamanders, crocodiles, scorpions, rats, squirrels, foxes, civets and turtles.Equally, urban markets in west and central Africa sell monkeys, bats, rats, and dozens of species of bird, mammal, insect and rodent slaughtered and sold close to open refuse dumps and with no drainage.“Wet markets make a perfect storm for cross-species transmission of pathogens,” says Gillespie. “Whenever you have novel interactions with a range of species in one place, whether that is in a natural environment like a forest or a wet market, you can have a spillover event.”The Wuhan market, along with others that sell live animals, has been shut by the Chinese authorities, and last month Beijing outlawed the trading and eating of wild animals except for fish and seafood. But bans on live animals being sold in urban areas or informal markets are not the answer, say some scientists.“The wet market in Lagos is notorious. It’s like a nuclear bomb waiting to happen. But it’s not fair to demonise places which do not have fridges. These traditional markets provide much of the food for Africa and Asia,” says Jones.“These markets are essential sources of food for hundreds of millions of poor people, and getting rid of them is impossible,” says Delia Grace, a senior epidemiologist and veterinarian with the International Livestock Research Institute, which is based in Nairobi, Kenya. She argues that bans force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene.Fevre and colleague Cecilia Tacoli, principal researcher in the human settlements research group at the International Institute of Environment and Development (IIED), argue in a blog post that rather than pointing the finger at wet markets, we should look at the burgeoning trade in wild animals.“It is wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses,” they write. “Wet markets are considered part of the informal food trade that is often blamed for contributing to spreading disease. But … evidence shows the link between informal markets and disease is not always so clear cut.”So what, if anything, can we do about all of this?Jones says that change must come from both rich and poor societies. Demand for wood, minerals and resources from the global north leads to the degraded landscapes and ecological disruption that drives disease, she says. “We must think about global biosecurity, find the weak points and bolster the provision of health care in developing countries. Otherwise we can expect more of the same,” she adds.“The risks are greater now. They were always present and have been there for generations. It is our interactions with that risk which must be changed,” says Brian Bird, a research virologist at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine One Health Institute, where he leads Ebola-related surveillance activities in Sierra Leone and elsewhere.“We are in an era now of chronic emergency,” Bird says. “Diseases are more likely to travel further and faster than before, which means we must be faster in our responses. It needs investments, change in human behaviour, and it means we must listen to people at community levels.”Getting the message about pathogens and disease to hunters, loggers, market traders and consumers is key, Bird says. “These spillovers start with one or two people. The solutions start with education and awareness. We must make people aware things are different now. I have learned from working in Sierra Leone with Ebola-affected people that local communities have the hunger and desire to have information,” he says. “They want to know what to do. They want to learn.”Fevre and Tacoli advocate rethinking urban infrastructure, particularly within low-income and informal settlements. “Short-term efforts are focused on containing the spread of infection,” they write. “The longer term – given that new infectious diseases will likely continue to spread rapidly into and within cities – calls for an overhaul of current approaches to urban planning and development.”The bottom line, Bird says, is to be prepared. “We can’t predict where the next pandemic will come from, so we need mitigation plans to take into account the worst possible scenarios,” he says. “The only certain thing is that the next one will certainly come.”• This piece is jointly published with Ensia"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/407baee7057e64311b5b6978da747c134a79e37a/164_165_1436_861/master/1436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdb77e33e9e3dfe6788931e9f577f0d8","title":"2020 european tree of the year in pictures","story":" The Czech Republic’s  of the Flooded Village pine is this year’s winner of the prestigious European Tree of the Year award, with Croatia’s Ginkgo from Daruvar securing the second and Russia’s Lonely Poplar the third place"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b6f580d6c560e8c963ee0d2577837fcacb5e658/94_0_1613_968/master/1613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12b90baaec703e338d10cbb2c8ba09fb","title":"dog actors replaced cgi","story":"Dog training is a complex, time-consuming art – and now that CGI can replace them, the canine characters are increasingly outsourced. At what cost?An old man and a dog sit on the moss-covered roof of a log cabin in the Canadian wilderness. It is a warm summer’s night – a river gurgles nearby. The man, named Thornton, and the dog, named Buck, have been on a long journey to reach this bucolic splendor, a journey that is now coming to an end. Buck has met a pack of wolves in the forest and is overcome by a primal urge to rejoin his ancestors. Thornton is despondent at the prospect of losing his friend. So, in one final act of submission, Buck nestles into Thornton’s lap, before he turns his back on domestication and returns to his own kind.This is a scene in the recent cinematic remake of Jack London’s 1903 novel The Call of the Wild, which tracks the journey of Buck, a highborn St Bernard collie cross. There have been several attempts at reimagining this tale in film: in 1935, a hulking St Bernard starred alongside Clark Gable in the first movie version of the novel. In 1972, Charlton Heston shared the screen with Buck the leonberger.In the most recent iteration of The Call of the Wild, directed by Chris Sanders, Harrison Ford takes the role of Thornton – but no dog appears on the film credits. In fact, if you were on set during shooting for the scene at the log cabin, you would see Ford, looking forlorn and rugged, and there, nestling in his lap, a fully grown man named Terry wearing a mo-cap suit.This is because the role of Buck has been outsourced to CGI. Of course, this animation technique has been used in Hollywood for a long time to animate, with striking realism, creatures that otherwise belong only in fiction. The dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. The super intelligent primates in the Planet of the Apes.In this movie, however, computer graphics are used to replace a figure that has played an outsized, though often unacknowledged, role in film history – the dog actor. At what cost?The history of dogs in cinema is as old as cinema itself. In the Lumière brothers’ pioneering 1895 film Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory in Lyon, a joyful mastiff bounds into frame 20 seconds through the 46-second-long reel, completely oblivious to having become part of movie history. This unexpected performance signals the uncontrolled, chaotic conditions under which directors first produced films, which is again demonstrated in the Lumière brothers’ 1897 Le Faux cul-de-jatte, in which a stray dog wonders on to the set, lifts his leg and urinates at the film’s pinnacle moment.As the movie industry was consolidated in Hollywood studios in the first decades of 20th century, dogs continued to appear in film, no longer as unplanned distractions, but as actors with headlining roles. Throughout the 1920s, in fact, one of the most famous actors in America was a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. He starred in 23 films that were so profitable they saved Warner Bros from bankruptcy more than once.Part of what made Rin Tin Tin successful is that he was working during the silent film era and critics were taken by his physical prowess. In a review for the Chicago Daily News, the poet Carl Sandberg wrote: “He has the power of expression in his every move that makes him one the leading pantomimists of the screen.”As with other celebrities, the public was also fascinated with Rin Tin Tin’s private life. During the first world war, he was rescued from a bombed-out trench by Lee Duncan, an American soldier who then dedicated his life to training the dog. In Los Angeles, Duncan would sometimes bring Rinty, as he was known, out on stage after the movie credits to demonstrate the range of his skills.While no other dog actor has since ascended Rinty’s heights, they have continued to play major roles in cinema. It was Toto, after all, who unveiled the Wizard of Oz. And Doc Taylor’s pet sheepdog, Einstein, was the very first creature to be blasted forward in time in the DeLorean.But if the dog’s presence onscreen delights, it also introduces an element of unpredictability in production. Dog training is a complex, time-consuming art. Not only does the dog actor have to learn bespoke behaviors for scenes, they have to bond with their fellow human actors and feel comfortable on set. And even then, the best-trained dog on the most professional set will occasionally give into some primal desire. Rin Tin Tin, for instance, once attacked a porcupine while shooting in the High Sierras, delaying production until the pock marks in his face healed.Since the 1940s, there have also been strict guidelines setting out appropriate behavior for animals on set, which is now codified in the American Humane Association’s 127-page long Guidelines for the Safe Use of Animals in Film Media. Animals rights groups like Peta closely monitor the industry to make sure producers comply, amplifying any hint of mistreatment to the public. When video surfaced of a distressed German shepherd struggling to keep its head above water on the set of A Dog’s Purpose in 2017, outcry was so intense that executives at Universal canceled the film’s premiere.Perhaps to bypass these uncertainties, the director Chris Sanders opted for a computer-generated dog to play the leading role in The Call of the Wild, which premiered on 21 February this year. Sanders, who co-directed Lilo and Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, designed Buck based off scanned images of a St Bernard collie cross that he and his wife adopted from a shelter in Kansas. The dog’s on-screen movements were then performed by a renowned “creature actor” named Terry Notary, who has been the invisible agent behind a number of CGI animals, including a murderous primate in Planet of the Apes.On the set of The Call of the Wild, Notary donned a mo-cap suit and acted out Buck’s role, mimicking dog-like movements. The graphics team then replaced his form with a computer-generated version of the dog during the editing stage. The output is a beautifully rendered though somewhat disorienting figure on screen.In scenes where Buck is shot from a distance – chasing rabbits through fields or hauling a sled through over the Alaskan tundra – he looks like a convincing, if intensely oversized, dog. But then, in more intimate moments when Buck is interacting with Thornton, his expressions and behaviors are bizarrely anthropomorphized. For example, the dog somehow understands that Thornton has a drinking problem and gazes at him disapprovingly as he sips his evening whiskey.One of the joys of London’s original novel is that it offers a dog’s-eye view of the world, a story where the action was motivated by animal desire. No doubt, Buck’s overdramatically humanlike expressions were an attempt to translate this into film. But for me it had the opposite effect. CGI Buck sits in an uncanny valley between dog-like human and human-like dog. He is visually compelling, but I felt no emotional draw to him as a character, as I have in the past with dogs on screen. (The Adventures of Milo and Otis is the very first movie I cried in.)Watching the film, I was reminded of Martin Scorsese’s recent critique of the CGI-laden Marvel franchise. They are theme parks, he said, not movies. They provide “audio visual entertainment” with no friction, no mystery, no emotional resonance. This, he went on, signifies a larger trend in the movie industry, where films are optimized to distract, entertain and generate maximum revenue, leaving little room for movies that “confront the unexpected on the screen”, which, for Scorsese, is the function of cinema.Since it first bounded on to the screen in the 19th century, the dog actor has been a medium for precisely this unexpected aesthetic experience. They perform unselfconsciously, with a heightened sense of immediacy. CGI Buck, a strange cyborg composite whose animal instincts are contrived by humans, fails to preserve this legacy. Indeed, he appears to represent precisely what Scorsese laments: the technological domestication of cinema."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29b18401a5c3209c874e3f347c8003d50aef8c90/0_315_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1faacd54919af1202a6e911bfd833d2","title":"euro 2020 next year coronavirus football","story":" The 1950s idealism behind the European Championship has been replaced by a ludicrously distended tournament – but celebration and collectivism could re-emerge at Euro 2021 The lamps are going out. They will be lit again across Europe – 15 months from now if current timescales hold. Although what traumas the 12 host cities for Uefa’s Euros of Everywhere might have endured by then is open to uncomfortable speculation.For now Rome’s piazzas are empty. Bucharest has declared a state of emergency. Madrid feels “like a meteorite has fallen on us”. As for the final venue, London, well, this place is coming like a ghost town.The decision to postpone Euro 2020 was announced on Tuesday afternoon after a video‑link conference of Uefa’s member associations. But it came as a surprise to nobody.Such is the speed of the news cycle it is hard to recall such ostensibly huge sporting news that has felt like such an afterthought.This time last week Liverpool were preparing to take on Atlético Madrid at Anfield and the established version of sporting reality seemed to be holding, just about. It took us a week to get from there to here. What paradigm shifts will the next five weeks hold? European football does at least have a revised, sensible-looking start date for this benighted, cumbersome sporting white elephant. Euro 2020 is now officially Euro 2021, destined to run from 11 June to 11 July with details and logistics to fall into step behind.What to make of this? It has become a reflex action to quail and froth at every decision made by the executive in every sphere. In reality there is no good solution to any of this, just as the postponement of European football’s £2bn cash cow shrinks into insignificance alongside the wider effects of the current viral slowdown.Like every other industry football is faced with guesswork, compromise and a sharp-faced vying up of the remaining wealth and space.There is at least time now to regroup and salvage something of the great global circus and to make some brittle-looking plans. The Champions League final has been put on hold, with some speculation of a final in high summer although it is worth remembering such statements are not solely directed at the watching public.The key discussions now are with rights holders, sponsors, insurers and above all lawyers. Best efforts are being made, just as best efforts must always be made where huge contractual payments are at issue. Pencil that date in. But not too heavily. In reality we are all subject to events now, and to an altered perspective.For those consumed by football’s weekly operetta it seems axiomatic that domestic competitions must be completed, that the world turns on these certainties. It is worth bearing in mind current projections are for peak-infection to arrive in the UK in early June. How will football feel in a world of isolation, infection, body counts and potential health‑service collapse? There is a time to play games. Whatever the illusion of control, we are all essentially spectators to this wider drama.Beyond the coming summer Uefa will have to decide what it wants to do with the women’s Euros, which would overlap this revised men’s tournament by four days.Perhaps the day will arrive sooner rather than later when, as in tennis, men’s and women’s tournaments can be played near-simultaneously, although that is a wider debate about visibility and projection. Separately there is also the Nations League (won’t someone think of the Nations League?) to be crammed in and World Cup 2022 qualifiers to be negotiated.These questions of scheduling can all be solved. The wider issue once seasons have been fudged and losses minimised is exactly where this leaves us. Football in the time of pandemic in the time of anti-globalism in an increasingly perilous-seeming world. How should it work? What’s the plan? Certainly this has always felt like a cursed tournament. Welcome to the Damned Euros. Will we ever be free of them? At the start of all this Michel Platini called his pan‑European show “zany, but a good idea”. In practice it has been neither.Uefa’s plan was a product of the banking meltdown in Europe, which deprived football of a suitably lavish and willing host. The border‑hopping, low-cost air‑travel compromise was a response to this. Eight years on The Euros of Everywhere occupies a neat but sickly position, bookended by two global crises.There is something extra poignant in their failure. The European Championship was conjured initially out of a spirit of hope, and of internationalism. Henri Delaunay, the first general secretary of Uefa, was hugely enthused by the ideals of the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor to the EU. His championship, the first edition of which eventually kicked off two years after his death, was in some small part a force for integration and progress.That skein of idealism has of course been consumed by the urge to expand and monetise this wildly successful arm of the entertainment industry.At the end of which Uefa has ended up bringing us this ludicrously distended version, with matches staged 3,200 miles apart, and one quarter-final due to take place at a point east of Riyadh.Even before the current crisis this has not been a story of endless growth. The Euros has looked for some time like an ailing, overstretched concept. Last time around the players were tired, the football lukewarm, the 24-team structure a failure.The European Championship will not take place this summer, with Uefa rescheduling it for 11 June to 11 July 2021. European football’s governing body also decided that play-off matches for Euro 2020 and international friendlies due to take place at the end of March will be played in the international window at the start of June, subject to a review of the situation with coronavirus. There may be further complications should the Republic of Ireland qualify for the Euros, with their manager, Mick McCarthy, due to be replaced by Stephen Kenny in August, and several other managers of qualified nations are out of contract in June, including Belgium’s Roberto Martínez.What does it mean for Champions League and Europa League?Uefa has established a working group with the participation of leagues and club representatives and aims “to complete all domestic and European club competitions by the end of the current sporting season, ie 30 June 2020 at the latest, should the situation improve and resuming playing be appropriate and prudent enough”.What about the women’s Euros?Scheduled to begin on 7 July 2021 at Old Trafford – four days before the men’s final will now take place at Wembley – Uefa has said the tournament will move but not to when. A year’s delay is an option. The Nations League finals and Under-21 Championship, also scheduled for summer 2021, will be rearranged too. Fifa’s newly expanded World Club Cup, due in China between 17 June and 4 July 2021, should move, its president, Gianni Infantino, said.What if I have Euro 2020 tickets?Uefa wants the format of 24 teams playing across 12 venues to stay and has said all tickets are transferable, with existing ticket buyers and hospitality clients able to claim refunds “for the face value of their tickets and packages in full”.Euro 2016 ended with French fans mooching out of the Stade de France as Portugal’s players took the fireworks, and a general sense of relief that an event staged under a state of national emergency had come to a peaceful end.In the meantime football’s calendar has become more bloated, the product stretched ever thinner. Even assuming a mass recovery, the players will face a brutal catch-up programme, with club competitions sliced and diced, and a rearranged Euros followed by a rearranged winter World Cup the following year.In the middle of which, here’s one hopeful thought. It seems likely Europe will now enter a time of austerity, uncertainty, even horror. Sport has always been at its best as a source of celebration and collectivism, as a note of beauty that stands outside the real world. A Euros in 2021 does at least offer the promise of some kind of re‑emergence. Distant as it seems, it could even be a time of joy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3edea643faa70a12fad1bccd7d75846e230d66/0_9_5412_3248/master/5412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=571d923cfe5290d44a7f122b429b6137","title":"uefa to reschedule womens euro 2021 after mens tournment moved","story":"Uefa today confirmed that the 2021 Women’s European Championship in England will be rescheduled to accommodate the men’s edition, which was due to take place this summer but was pushed back a year as football attempts to get to grips with the coronavirus crisis.With the start of the men’s tournament postponed until 11 June 2021 and the Wembley final set for 11 July, there is a four-day overlap with the women’s tournament, which was due to kick off on 7 July at Old Trafford. understands that, despite some federations believing this to mean the women’s tournament will fill the vacant summer 2022 slot– the men’s World Cup is being held in the winter – the option of playing the two European tournaments back to back in 2021 is still very much on the table.”We are thinking of postponing this Women’s Euro and Under-21 championship as well,” he said. “We will have to postpone both because I don’t think that we should cannibalise the women’s Euro with the men’s Euro just one month before.”Both options have their pitfalls. Pushing the women’s Euros back to 2022 would mean, with the future of the Olympics in question, that there could be a three-year gap in top-level international women’s football. Sponsorship cycles would likely need to be renegotiated. There would probably be implications for European qualifying for the 2023 World Cup, too.Moving the competition to 2022 would also throw up some interesting issues for the FA and the Lionesses. Phil Neville’s contract is up for renewal in 2021, after the women’s Euros as presently scheduled, and there has been a feeling that, despite England’s poor run of form, the short window before the Lionesses bid for a European trophy on home soil means changing the manager would be difficult. While the FA have privately said they are fully behind Neville, a change in the calendar could prompt a shift in attitudes were a new candidate able to have time in which to influence the team’s fortunes.There is also the issue of whether Neville himself wishes to continue for an additional year. Furthermore, the ageing Lionesses, many of whom have been targeting the home tournament for their international swansong, would also be forced to consider whether they will be able play on at the top level for an extra year.However, persisting with the tournament in 2021 would see the buildup to it consumed by the men’s tournament, going head to head with it for column inches and airtime, and there will likely be fears of the summer reaching a football saturation point before a ball is kicked at Old Trafford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117620f36c461cb7aa0689063922ad3fe7ecdf18/267_394_3056_1834/master/3056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce7ba33b098c3515e58d0350e36c313f","title":"what are the highest fees paid by football clubs for others managers","story":"Plus: more early league winners, more teams playing at rivals’ grounds, keepers winning penalties and more“What are the highest fees paid by clubs for other teams’ managers?” asks Alan Gomes.“I immediately thought of the fee paid by Frank Lampard’s Chelsea to acquire Frank Lampard from Derby County, which was reported to be £3m-4m,” begins James Wayne. “A quick search led me to this tweet, and a list drawn up by Portuguese newspaper A Bola.”André Villas-Boas tops that list, after Chelsea triggered his Porto release clause in 2011 for €15m (£13.2m at the time). That didn’t work out too well, and neither did the £6.2m Manchester City paid Blackburn for Mark Hughes.As James points out, there are some success stories: Chelsea paying €6m for José Mourinho, and Real Madrid forking out just under €4m for Carlo Ancelotti in 2013. The Italian secured the Spanish club’s sought-after decima in the European Cup – so it was money well spent.Following last week’s column, we’ve had more nominations for the earliest title winners – starting in Scotland …“Celtic clinched the 2013-14 Scottish Premiership on the 26 March,” notes Michael Mooney. A 5-1 away win at Partick Thistle sealed the deal for Celtic, who finished 29 points clear of Motherwell. That was the earliest title win in Scotland since 1928-29, when Rangers wrapped it up on 16 March.”And on 5 January 1889, Preston beat Notts County 4-1, leaving Aston Villa needing to avoid defeat at Burnley. Villa lost 4-0, handing North End the title. Preston memorably went on to finish the league season unbeaten.Another entry for our list of clubs playing “home” games at their rivals’ grounds, from Rob Fielding:In March 2001, Port Vale were just two games away from the Football League Trophy final, and had been drawn at home against local rivals Stoke City. Amid fixture congestion and with the Vale Park pitch in a poor state, Vale voluntarily gave up their home advantage to play at the Britannia Stadium instead.It turned out to be a successful gamble. Vale won the ‘home’ game 2-1, and despite a fixture backlog which saw them play seven league games in April, they made it to the Millennium Stadium, beat Brentford 2-1 in the final and lifted only the club’s second domestic trophy.”Following up on a question we posed back in January, Michael Baars nominates the legendary coach Rinus Michels, who wasn’t a bad player either.Michels made his Ajax debut as an 18-year old in 1946 and although he wasn’t a substitute, he had been called into the squad after an injury to Han Lambregt. The teenage centre-forward, very much the Erling Braut Haaland of his day, banged in five goals as Ajax beat ADO Den Haag 8-3.“Has a goalkeeper, sent up into the opposition area in the last minute, ever won a penalty?” wonders James Murton.“In November 2011, Blackburn Rovers were away to Wigan, when goalkeeper Paul Robinson went up to join the attack,” writes Kenny Hodkinson. “He won a penalty after getting a kick to the head.” The Latics’ David Jones was the guilty party, and Yakubu converted to earn Rovers a 3-3 draw. Here’s some fan footage of the incident.Alexander Stephenson suggests a tale we highlighted recently: “David James was sent up front for Manchester City by Stuart Pearce, against Middlesbrough in 2005. He caused sufficient panic in the away defence that they conceded a penalty. Robbie Fowler took the spot-kick, knowing a goal would send City into the Uefa Cup at Boro’s expense – but Mark Schwarzer saved it.”“Against which player did Peter Shilton make his only penalty save for England? It’s got me stumped,” admitted Carl Hollingworth, back in 2000.Shilton’s only penalty success in an England shirt came when he saved a spot-kick from West Germany’s Andreas Brehme in a 1985 friendly in Mexico City. England won 3-0 in a game that was part of the “Azteca 2000” tournament, a warm-up for the 1986 World Cup. Hosts Mexico won both their matches to top the standings.According to commentator Brian Moore, Brehme’s blunder was the Germans’ fourth straight penalty miss. Brehme had the last laugh, pelting one past the spring-haired custodian in some match or other in Turin five years later. And a few days after that, he became the first man to settle a World Cup final from the spot – his first penalty scored for his country in open play.“With the increase in games with no spectators because of the coronavirus outbreak, have there been instances in the past of teams using loudspeakers, cardboard cutouts of fans, or similar effects to try and replicate the atmosphere of a full stadium?” wonders Christopher Sato.“The 1957 Floodlight Cup final in Germany between Frankfurt and Schalke was decided on the number of corners won (8-6 to Frankfurt) after the tie finished level on aggregate,” writes Andrew Burrows. “Any other unusual ways of deciding matches or tournaments?”“What is the highest position in the Premier League a club has finished with a negative goal difference? And what is the lowest position of a club with a positive goal difference?” asks Mitch Mitchell.“On Saturday 7 March there were 12 matches in the National League and only one home team (Sutton United) managed to notch a win,” notes John Edwards. “Is this some sort of record?”“AZ defender Teun Koopmeiners has already scored nine penalties in the Ereisie this season,” writes Bas Vlaming. “This is a lot, but surely someone must have scored more penalties in a season?”Email your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ab693ce8193d92ad62ee15787e2ebd072b08f2/0_88_2500_1501/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f004ea63a600b56b51beb8357e90fee1","title":"photographs black teenage boys prejudice stereotypes","story":"Kay Rufai’s images of smiling 13-year-olds are one project confronting damaging stereotypes of black boys and menIn terms of challenging stereotypes and representations of black boys this was so powerful for me … because it’s not an image that you’re used to ever seeing, and you question why it has such an impact on you,” says Kay Rufai. He is talking about the 16 large-scale colour photographs of teenage boys that went on display at City Hall in London last autumn. They are distinctive in that each of the 13-year-olds is smiling, captured in moments of happiness, relaxation and vulnerability.“For them to allow me to capture this of them took a lot of work, to peel back these layers of stoicism that they need for protection and self-preservation, but which fuel a self-fulfilling prophecy of what people perceive them to be,” he says.The photographs are on show again this month, printed on to large flags hanging from the ceiling at Brixton Village Market.But Rufai’s photography is just the most high-profile aspect of a wider initiative, the Smile-ing Boys Project, which aims to address the mental health needs of black teenage boys that can go unacknowledged and unmet. Rufai, whose previous work has explored issues around masculinity, says the project was a direct response to rising levels of knife crime, government “kneejerk” reactions and the media portrayal of black boys and men as perpetrators and victims.As a black male artist already working with young people, Rufai explains, he could see that rising knife crime was a “symptom of something bigger” and young black boys weren’t being given the tools to manage their mental health.“These young boys don’t have positive outlets,” he says. “Who’s talking about that? I realised that nobody was – and if they were, it was on the margins.”With £32,000 funding from the Wellcome Trust, Rufai developed a series of workshops around the eight “pillars” of happiness, such as belonging, security and sense of purpose. He even travelled to Scandinavia and Bhutan – which measures prosperity through gross national happiness – to carry out background research.About 30 boys were recruited from three schools in south London via teacher recommendations as being among the most disengaged. They were given cameras to document which aspects of their lives were contributing to, or working against, their happiness, including people and places.The boys then discussed the photos together in the workshops and talked about which aspects of their lives they had control over and which ones they didn’t.“It created a platform for them to discuss the things they generally weren’t able to talk to people about,” says Rufai. The challenge of having an absent father was an important issue to emerge, says the 36-year-old, who was born in Poplar, east London, but grew up in Nigeria and California – and one he faced himself during his childhood.Last year’s eight-month pilot project culminated in an exhibition of the boys’ work at Battersea Arts Centre, with extra funding from the Arts Council. It documented their stories through their photography, poetry and creative writing.The Smile-ing Boys Project is now in four more schools, but Rufai wants to eventually see this preventative work in all schools in the capital as an alternative provision to “typically punitive ways of dealing with kids that they struggle to engage with”, such as pupil referral units or exclusion units.The Smile-ing Boys initiative was one of two contrasting projects to emerge last year that both used photographic portraits to challenge stereotypes of black boys and men, and the perceptions they may have of themselves.The 56 Black Men campaign used a series of portraits of black working men wearing hooded tops to cast a spotlight on the issue. The men, photographed by and including the project’s founder, Cephas Williams, look straight at the camera, compelling the viewer to look them directly in the eye.Their job titles and achievements – such as MP, court clerk, project manager, physiotherapist – are written below, challenging people to examine their own prejudices about what black men can be.Beamed across social media, on billboards and exhibited at the headquarters of the advertising agency M\u0026ampC Saatchi, the portraits sparked a national conversation about stereotypes and the role of the media in the negative representation of black men.Williams, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, grew up in New Cross, south London, where his peers were predominantly black and Essex, where he was at one point the only black pupil in his school. He describes attending college among mainly black people and then stepping into a white world when he took up a degree in architecture. These experiences he says, helped “inform a world view”.He first conceived the idea in 2018 after his project to develop a studio for the local creative community in Peckham High Street stalled because of difficulties with the council and others over the building. Williams turned his frustration into positive action by launching a campaign to help black men change their own narrative.The portraits were a powerful way to attract attention and start a conversation. He chose 56 because this was how many black men were murdered in London in 2018. “The premise really is for black men and boys to see ourselves amplified in a positive light for once,” he says. He adds that 56 Black Men has become a “movement”. Williams, who gives talks on issues around ersity and inclusion to FTSE 100 companies, says: “There are so many other positive black men out there doing stuff like this who don’t get seen, who don’t get the support they need. Instead of their efforts being highlighted, we’re always talking about the negative portrayal of black men.” With this in mind, Williams has big ambitions as the project enters its second year. He wants to raise funds to bring black men to the stage to tell their stories through “56 Black Men Live” events. An initial show held at Theatre Peckham in October, he says, was a success, but he hopes shows will be run at high-profile venues such as the National Theatre in the long run.Williams says: “56 Black Men wants to bring storytelling to the stage, part of the reason being that we want black men to be in control of their own narrative.” Williams is also planning a campaign against racism in football in the form of another portrait series featuring black men connected by their love for the sport. At the same time, he is working with City companies to create an “experience exchange” to give black men direct access to business leaders in the City and other industries. It will help address the problem of black men feeling as if they do not necessarily fit the mould to work in these industries and also change stereotypical perceptions among chief executives and other decision-makers.“A lot of people live on one side of the river and these black boys live on the other side of the river – and they never get to have a real conversation. There’s no forum set up for that,” says Williams. “So how do we build more inclusive companies when we don’t understand what it feels like to be this person?”For Williams, the overall strength of the movement will come in numbers and making connections with those who wield power and influence. A 56 Black Men members’ club has even been suggested. “For the black community, we need what I’ve coined as a ‘unified knock’,” he says. “It’s not just inidual people knocking on doors, getting dribs and drabs of money and support and dribs and drabs of allies,” he says.• The Smile-ing Boys portraits are at Brixton Village Market until 28 April. Another set of  portraits will be at Battersea Arts Centre from 2-19 April. 56 Black Men portraits can be viewed viewed at 56blackmen "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166dcfd84a9c626239d5a20bf4973be581df4560/1452_169_2896_1737/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ebd1442f277a7b13bce2292db9f502a","title":"i havent worn colour since i was 14 meet britains longest standing goths","story":"Born in the 80s, goth is still going strong. Four devotees discuss the music and fashion and how love of the macabre draws together a warm and friendly sceneGoths are perhaps the most maligned of all subcultures. Over the decades, they have been unfairly blamed for high-school shootings, depression in teenagers and antisocial behaviour. In reality, goths are a collective of people bound by a shared love of fashion, music and art.Goth emerged out of the punk scene in the north of England in the 1980s. Its adherents are immediately recognisable by their black clothing and jewellery, their passion for artists such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Nick Cave and the Sisters of Mercy, and their fondness for imagery and lyrics referencing the macabre, darkness and death. And the eyeliner, of course.Years of unfavourable press attention have bound goths together more tightly than other subcultures. “The scene has been partly defined by how it’s been viewed negatively,” says Dr Paul Hodkinson, a sociologist at the University of Surrey and an expert in goth culture. “That negative attention can give its participants an extra commitment to the scene, and strengthens their identity in the face of a perceived mainstream society that misunderstands or mistreats them.’”Unlike other subcultures, says Hodkinson, goth culture tends to be close-knit as a result of this shared experience of victimisation. Many goths stay active in the scene throughout their lives. We spoke to some of Britain’s long-standing goths about the scene, fashion and music, and whether they ever see themselves wearing colour in their future.I have been a goth since university. There was a girl – she was interesting and cool and she dragged me to a goth club. Nothing ever happened with her, but the goth thing stuck.I was living in Wolverhampton at the time, and there wasn’t much goth stuff going on. I heard about the first Whitby Goth festival, in 1994, through forums on the internet. There were 212 of us there. It completely exploded my mind.My dress sense has varied a lot over the years. I’m not as young as I once was. I don’t have a full mohican any more – I got rid of it around 2000, when I started going thin on top. Since then, I’ve developed a love of hats. I’ve got a massive wardrobe. I wouldn’t call it a wardrobe – it’s probably about three rooms.I always make a big effort on Halloween. One year, I was a white wolf. I had lace-up white boots, a white gothic jacket and a wolf head. I crept up behind my friend and growled at her. She ended up having a panic attack. I guess that outfit was a little too successful.Being goth is not something I’m going to grow out of. I’ve got masses of friends from the alternative scene. There’s this misconception that all goths are miserable. Yes, there’s a sense of macabre, but there’s an amazing camaraderie and sense of community.I think because of my size, I get less abuse than other goths. I’m quite good at de-escalating hostile situations. I can normally sort things out without fighting. There’s always the odd drive-by shouting, but you get used to that. A few years ago, I was in Camden, north London, with a girlfriend — we were all dressed up to go to a ball. People in the street started whistling The Addams Family theme tune. But we were quite proud of it. At one of the earliest Whitbys, a few idiots came up from Scarborough and decided they would try and intimidate us by blaring 80s music from a Vauxhall Corsa. But the police moved them on pretty fast.Lots of goths tend to avoid customer-facing roles, because they get asked to tone down their outfits by their bosses. I’ve only been asked to do that once, when I was working for a traffic company years ago. I had grabbed a T-shirt out of a drawer without looking at it and it had quite an offensive slogan on it, so that was fair enough. It’s not such an issue for me, because I quite like wearing suits. I look good in them – as long as they are tailored.I have a theory that lots of goths were bullied growing up. Society turned its back on us, so we all went off and did our own thing. The clothes and the makeup are just a way to differentiate who is worth getting to know. Some people look at the clothes and are put off. But the people who take the time to look beneath it are the ones worth getting to know.I have been a goth since I was 13. It’s just my taste – I’m drawn to darkness. Growing up in Italy, I was really into music and art. I loved Caravaggio, because he was so dark. I discovered the band Paradise Lost when I was 18 – they were the first band I heard that blended metal with goth. For me, that was the perfect mix. I read an interview with them where they talked about being from Yorkshire, and I thought: where is Yorkshire? When I moved to York, it was bizarre, knowing I was in the place where goth metal was basically invented.I dress goth every day. I haven’t worn colour since I was 14. Normally, I wear pale foundation, black eyeliner and blue, black or dark red lipstick. I can’t see myself ever wearing colour. I briefly worked as a theatre steward in Cambridge when I was younger. The uniform was yellow – it wasn’t like it was burning my skin or anything, but now that I don’t have to wear a uniform, I only ever wear black. I think if I ever went into work wearing coloured clothes, my colleagues would have a heart attack! We joke that I should wear a floral dress on Halloween.My house is entirely black and white. I have too many skulls to count. I’m really proud of the downstairs toilet – I call it my little catacomb. It’s painted black, even the ceiling, and I have a customised loo-roll holder in the shape of a coffin. I’m currently waiting for a customised four-poster bed with a built-in spiderweb to arrive.I’m more into goth music than the aesthetic. I don’t like how the goth scene is split in two. There are the people who are there because they love the music, and then the people who just like to go to Whitby and dress up. Why would you pretend to be goth just for a day? It makes a mockery of goth culture.People assume that you’re depressed if you’re a goth, but it’s just the way I am. I think it’s a positive thing to think about death. You think about the end to remind yourself to make the most of life each day.I have been a goth, on and off, for 20 years. I got into it as a teenager – I would listen to bands such as Sisters of Mercy, the Mission and New Model Army. It helped that I grew up in West Yorkshire, which is where lots of goth culture was based. Growing up in a small town, people weren’t used to alternative subcultures they were quite vocal about it. You had to be careful about how you would present yourself in public, to avoid getting into trouble.I can still remember my first proper goth night out. It was a club called the Phono, this old-school alternative goth club in Leeds. I’d go there all the time. It was so exciting. It was this world of dreadlocks, big hair, PVC and Dr Martens.For a long time, the goth scene was in decline, but things are probably as good now as they have ever been. I run a festival called Goth City and in addition to that there are maybe a dozen goth festivals in the UK, and 100 gigging goth bands.If I’ve got meetings at work, I wear a suit. Otherwise, I wear black jeans, a black blazer, pointed boots and a black frock coat. I always find myself returning to that hammy Victorian style – I like the tailcoat and white shirt and big hair aesthetic. David Vanian of the Damned is probably my biggest style influence. And if I’m going out, I like to make my long black hair as big as possible with hairspray.I would like to be able to express myself as I want more often. Work isn’t such an issue – you can rock a strong goth look and still be extremely smart. I think goths tend to look more professional than non-goths. But it’s harder to find the time and spaces to dress goth as you get older. It becomes less practical, as you are in goth spaces less often. That said, I definitely don’t ever go out in tracksuits or blue jeans. I do own a single pair of jeans. I wear them maybe once a year, in summer.There can be a bit of street heckling that goes on. It’s never particularly intelligent: people will shout “Dracula”, or whatever horror movie they can think of. It’s only ever if I find myself in a town centre on a Friday or Saturday night, when people have been drinking. That’s when you want to be careful. But I would never go out in that environment anyway, because you’re looking for conflict. I tend to avoid town centres on a weekend. I don’t want to attract attention. It’s not really an issue for me – I wouldn’t want to go out there anyway. Nothing brings me into town.I see myself as an old-school goth. Not in an elitist way, but more in the sense of being true to the original counter-culture tradition of goth, as it came out of Leeds. We have an agenda that is liberal and progressive and an affinity to a darker, romantic view of the world. We’re not all unhappy. There are a lot of extremely chipper goths out there. The idea that all goths are morbid and depressed definitely isn’t the case.I got into goth music when I was 13. When you’re a teenager, you feel like you need your own identity. Post-punk alternative goth music appealed to me, so I went from there. My father absolutely hated it. He couldn’t understand why I was dressed all in black. The more he disliked it, the more I rebelled.Between 13 and 16, I couldn’t go to pubs or nightclubs and meet other goths, so I stayed in my bedroom and listened to goth music and read Melody Maker and NME. When I left my bedroom, I would wear black leggings, pointy boots, a Sisters of Mercy T-shirt and have my hair all black and crimped. I did get a lot of stick for how I looked – I was the only goth in my sleepy market town.As soon as I turned 18, I moved to Leeds because that was the epicentre of goth culture. It was great: amazing nightlife, really nice people. But the scene died overnight in 93, 94. I’d go down to the Phono nightclub and it had completely changed. All the people I knew there had stopped going. They all moved on with their lives. But I thought: “I’m not ready to grow out of this.” So it developed into more of a lifestyle than a phase. There isn’t another Mel who isn’t a goth.My house is all goth: black flock wallpaper, black settees, black gloss furniture, baroque-style ornaments. I never get bored of wearing black. It’s a godsend, because you never have to separate your clothes when you’re wearing them. I married a goth. We had the wedding in a castle, and I wore a purple corset, with a big flouncy skirt to go with it, and purple and black hair extensions.Any time something bad happens, like a shooting spree, people say: “He was dressed in a trench coat and listening to Marilyn Manson.” But that doesn’t define goth. It goes a lot deeper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb153f941128e7b5b924858977b46664bd7c44b3/15_0_3437_2062/master/3437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66641ff895c926e258dae6411f8a2a93","title":"uk banks set out details of covid 19 mortgage holidays","story":"Households hit by coronavirus will not lose credit ratings if they delay paymentsBritain’s banks have revealed how they are going to implement Rishi Sunak’s promise of “payment holidays” of up to three months.In guidance issued after the chancellor pledged mortgage support for households affected by the coronavirus, UK Finance, the trade body for the major banks, set out how households can apply.There will be a fast-track system for approval, but not everyone will be granted a payment holiday. The unpaid interest will still be recovered later, but inidual credit ratings will not be affected.“Firms will help customers the best way for the inidual, but an automatic payment holiday may not always be the most suitable approach and may not be required by all customers,” said UK Finance.The holidays will not constitute free money. The banks said they remain obliged under Financial Conduct Authority rules to ensure that any “forbearance” will still assume an eventual full repayment of arrears.While a person is taking a payment holiday, the interest that would have been paid will still rack up, and the capital sum of the loan remains.But repossessions are extremely unlikely if someone fails to pay. “Forbearance needs to minimise the risk of possession,” said the banks.The banks admit the payment holidays are not a long-term solution but are designed only for a temporary income shortfall.“This is not a solution where, because of a permanent reduction in income, a borrower is unable to afford anywhere near the full mortgage repayments and there is little prospect of an improvement in the situation in the foreseeable future,” said UK Finance.Some borrowers who have already approached the banks for a payment holiday have been warned that, in effect, their credit score will be shredded. The banks have allayed these fears, saying: “Forbearance offered under these circumstances will not result in an adverse impact on the customer’s credit score.”There is little comfort for landlords with buy-to-let loans. The scheme does not appear to extend to them, and they are being told simply to contact their bank if they are running into problems paying the mortgage.Advisers said more detail was needed. Sam Harhat, of Andrews Property Group, said: “The government’s backing of mortgage holidays of up to three months for struggling households is clearly welcome but, as ever, the devil is in the detail.“If this is a smooth and seamless process that will enable homeowners to self-isolate without having to worry about their mortgage payments then clearly it is a significant move in the right direction.“The elephant in the room, of course, is how the government will be helping the huge numbers of tenants who may also struggle with their rental payments. For homeowners, the government made all the right noises in Tuesday’s media conference but for tenants we need considerably more clarity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b63b9954893e848fb889ffb0624837db104fe072/0_1155_3073_1844/master/3073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=993c7743308372b512995dfb8f209f87","title":"the back door fell out and we cant shower in our new rental","story":"My partner and I signed a £900 rental agreement on a house three months ago. It was described by the letting agents, Connells, as a having a bath and a separate shower. On the first day we found out that the shower dispenses scalding water only – and is therefore dangerous and unusable – and we immediately reported it to Connells. We had several visits from a plumber before it was concluded that the whole unit needed to be replaced. Moreover, the back door fell out of its rotten frame and it took two days before it was boarded up, which invalidated our insurance. It was never replaced. We have also reported the conservatory roof leaking badly and causing mould on the walls. This complaint was not even acknowledged. We know from the landlord that the faulty shower was reported by previous tenants – so he was aware of the problem, but chose not to do anything about it. We would not have rented the property knowing it had no working shower. I know that, for goods and services, we would have protection under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 for items “not as described”. Does it apply to tenanted properties? MS, CannockUnfortunately it does not. Or rather, not in the way you are hoping. The act does outlaw unfair terms in tenancy agreements which are not prominently and clearly stated.In your situation the rights are stacked in favour of the landlord who, ultimately, can withhold your deposit or even evict you. When I asked Connells whether it checks properties before renting them, it said they are assessed thoroughly and claimed that the rotten door was marked in “good condition” there was no sign of a leak and the shower fault was not known about as a different agent had previously managed the property.It said the landlord preferred to use his own contractors, but has now agreed to allow Connells to organise the work. However, although Connells told me the landlord was prepared to discuss compensation, he has since refused your request for a rent rebate, stating that a shower is not reflected in the rental cost, which covers “space, location and facilities such as a new kitchen and two toilets”. Many properties lack a shower, he adds irrelevantly in his response to you.Tenants in your predicament have limited options. If you withhold rent the landlord is entitled to serve a notice to quit. You run the same risk if you sort repairs yourself then deduct the cost from your rental payments, although you can do this for minor repairs provided the landlord has had ample opportunity to carry out the works and you have notified them in writing that you plan to organise the work yourself if they don’t step up within a given deadline.You must obtain three quotes and send receipts and forewarn them in writing at each stage. You can’t even decide to walk out or the landlord may sue you for any rent you owe right up until the contract ends, although you can give notice if there is a serious breach of the agreement.If neglected repair work is causing a health and safety risk you can ask the local council to inspect the property. You could also complain to the property ombudsman, of which Connells is a member.As a last resort the small claims court is an option for repairs costing less than £1,000.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

A day after Boris Johnson strongly advised people to avoid pubs, clubs and theatres as part of a dramatic escalation of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, the  visited venues in three parts of the country – Rochdale, Wareham and London –\u0026nbspto assess how closely the government’s advice was being followed and found many publicans and their customers in a defiant mood.Opposite Rochdale’s Gothic town hall, the doors of the town’s busiest and best-known pub, the Flying Horse Hotel, were defiantly open. “We will stay open until the minute they tell us we have to shut,” said its owner, Ben Boothman, 38, surveying the smattering of drinkers sat around the oak bar.Boothman announced in a stirring Facebook post on Tuesday that the pub would continue serving punters as it had done “for the last 330 years”. The pub had endured “some of humanity’s biggest threats”, he wrote. “Smallpox, Spanish flu, six recessions, two world wars, the rise and fall of an empire, the start and end to our involvement in Europe, Napoleon, Hitler and Mr Blobby.”Yet it is coronavirus – a disease that emerged only four months ago – that poses the biggest threat to its existence. Boothman owns six pubs and restaurants in Rochdale, employing 100 people and paying £20,000 a week in wages. The effect of Boris Johnson’s press conference on Monday night was immediate and dramatic. “It probably took £15,000 off us – that one announcement,” he said.The Flying Horse would usually serve 40 meals on a Monday night. It served only three after the prime minister’s speech. There were a few more drinkers than usual – “That’s northern defiance for you,” he said – but many of the regulars stayed away on Tuesday. Worse, the coronavirus is so novel that Boothman is not covered by his insurers.“At the minute we’re just haemorrhaging money,” he said. The government’s advice for people to stay away – but allowing them to remain open – presented pubs with the “worst case scenario”, he said. “I will never voluntarily shut the doors and lay my staff off. The government needs to tell us to do it but they don’t have the balls. It’s a shitshow, but you can get through a shitshow with a bit of guidance.”Lunchtime punters were similarly defiant. “Why would you tell people not to go there but leave the pubs open? It’s a bit silly. I think the prime minister’s a bit of a vy,” said Melissa Parker, 28, a student who popped into the Flying Horse for a meal after shopping in the town centre. “I just think if the pubs are open then I will be in them – until it’s on lockdown.”Boothman has offered free rooms in the hotel above his pub for people worried about potentially giving the virus to loved ones at home. The pub will also offer deliveries via JustEat later this week. Even then, he said, the situation is dire across the town. “Takings yesterday were frightening. Frightening,” he said. JHDrinking buddies Frank Tranter, 80, and Julian Thomas, 72, were joking about the idea of self-isolation as they nursed pints of beer at the bar of the Duke of Wellington in Wareham, Dorset.“If and when the government says that we absolutely can’t go out, I’ll think seriously about it,” said Tranter. “Until then we’re going to do our self-isolating right here.”Thomas agreed. “It’s important for locals like us to keep pubs going. If we don’t come, places like this will go bust. We are keeping a metre apart, though.”Outside the pub the staff have set up a sign reading: “Alcohol kills the virus.” Adrian Hole, the chefmanager, was busy frying up fish and chip lunches (£4.95 on a Tuesday). “It’s been as busy as ever,” he said. “We’re being careful not to over-order but we have to keep on. We’re just a small free house. We can’t afford to shut.”James Warren, the owner of the Salt Pig farm shop and cafe on North Street, said breakfast had been quiet but it had picked up for lunchtime. “It’s been a very difficult time – a long winter, rainy weather, Brexit, the general election. And then we’ve got this.”Warren has concerns, such as whether 26 weddings he is due to cater through the spring and summer will be cancelled. But he is also looking for the possible bright side. “We have lots of second-home owners here. If people leave London to come to the country, we may do well,” he said.One of his regulars, David Burbidge, 75, was tucking into a pulled pork Purbeck pasty. “I wanted to come out and support this place,” he said. “I feel fine and don’t think I need to stay at home.”Almost every shop, cafe and restaurant remained open in Wareham. The library was busy with elderly people picking up the free paper the Swanage and Wareham Advertiser. The tourist information office said people were out and about going for walks. The nail bar was doing reasonable business.A community cafe, attached to a church, was one of the few places that had closed. A notice outside read: “Out of responsibility for our volunteers and customers, we have decided to close.”Mother and son Jane Spencer and Andrew Welch, who run the Anglebury guesthouse, bar and restaurant, were gloomier than most. They also remain open but worked out that they have already lost more than £6,000 in cancelled guesthouse bookings.“We’re caught between the devil and the deep blue sea,” said Welch. “If we close we commit business suicide. If we stay open we could be risking our health.”Spencer criticised the government’s handling of the crisis. “We have full insurance, including for business interruption, but if the government doesn’t tell us we have to close then we won’t get it.”They are already considering laying off staff. “We’ve been going 20 years and the last 18 months have been our best,” said Spencer. “But we don’t know what we’re going to do now. It’s potentially disastrous.” SMOn Fleet Street, business at the oldest Irish pub in London was struggling. Steven Rowlands, who has been the landlord of The Tipperary for more than 15 years, said he stands to lose £10,000 in one day as St Patrick’s Day custom evaporated.Every year the pub opens early (10.30am) to accommodate revellers. He should have already served between 60-70 people, as “everybody comes here” but by noon he had served only four – including one punter who was drinking through a straw while wearing a surgical mask. The upstairs restaurant had seen all 35 of its bookings swiftly cancelled on Monday night as public fears about going to pubs set in following the prime minister’s statement.Symptoms are defined as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.Information: If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Down in the cellar, Rowlands gestured towards 25-30 barrels, full of Guinness, that would, on a typical St Paddy’s Day, be close to running dry by now. “By 4pm I’d usually be putting in an order for more Guinness – not this year. There are 88 pints to a barrel, so here I’m sitting on over 2,500 pints of Guinness alone, let alone the beer, lager and everything else I’ve got to sell.”He had expected a downturn and had not ordered the seafood bar the pub would usually have at this time of year. By 2pm things had picked up somewhat, but nowhere near enough – Rowlands said the tills were two-thirds down on what they should be. “You usually can’t fit through the door in here, we’d have people out drinking on the street. Not this year.”A great supporter of Boris Johnson, Rowlands criticised the lack of clarity from the government. “Either you do it and close everything, or you don’t. Right now we have to get on with it, the world can’t stop turning, I have no choice at the moment but to stay open. If I shut, I still have rent, bills and staff to pay. So I can’t shut unless the government says I have to.“I’m looking to be down £12,000-15,000 since last Friday afternoon. We need help – whether it’s with rent, council tax, business rates, somebody needs to compensate us if we’re told to shut because I’m still liable to pay the bills.”Also at the bar was Brian Porter, 73, who used to run the Tipperary. He added that the government needed to be clear about what pubs were supposed to do. “These businesses already operating on small margins – if we take it upon ourselves to close, what do we do about all these bills? Right now, we’re in limbo. We can only close if we’re told to close.” LCOne of the busiest shopping districts in the country had an air of devastation.Landmark stores such as Nike, Apple and Microsoft were closed, the Scribbles card shop had one of its worst days despite an imminent Mother’s Day, while popular chains such as Pret a Manger had already shortened their opening hours.Francesca Toma, manager at Pret’s store in Hanover Square, wondered if they could remain open in the longer term as a row of staff dealt with a trickle of customers.“Normally this would be completely full, there would be nine queues of people out the door, you couldn’t be able to see the fridges,” she said.Kintan Japanese restaurant on Princes Street was completely empty. “Normally we would have 120 people here, today we have zero,” said manager Carmelo Giaconia.“I have sent six people home already and if it continues like this more or less the same tonight. When Boris Johnson said people should avoid restaurants what does that mean? If you go to the restaurant, it’s your problem? Everyone here cares about the health of customers, we sanitise, but our leader doesn’t seem to care about people who pay taxes and I pay a lot of taxes,” he added.At the Shakespeares Head in Carnaby Street, only four people were lured in by the St Patrick’s Day promotion.Even the Salvation Army, on which homeless people rely for food, had closed but was expected to provide takeaway food.Others were taking the health of people very seriously – Tilly, 44, had run 10km in from Muswell Hill to avoid mingling with the public as she wanted to protect herself from a potential infection ahead of a meeting with some vulnerable people.

But, she argued, the idea was pushed through the party without proper debate.“I’ve been talking to activists who say, yes, they were bounced into it, partly because the decision was made in rooms in Westminster with not enough dissenting voices before,” Moran said. “So by the time it went to conference, it felt like it was a confidence motion.”While the Lib Dems pride themselves on being a grassroots-led party, Moran said this was being lost: “I’m concerned, if you look at the parliamentary party makeup at the moment, we are going to be perceived as a party of the elite of London and the south-east.“And that absolutely is not what I want for our party, we need to be a party for the entire country. And so, yes, we absolutely need to change the way we make policy.”The two biggest obstacles the party faced in December’s election, Moran said, remained the electoral system and potential voters’ distaste for Jeremy Corbyn. “But that doesn’t absolve us from our own responsibility for decisions that we took,” she said. Moran refused to say which of the three candidates to succeed Corbyn she would most like to work with, but said that whoever did take over would need to not just cooperate better with other parties and embrace electoral change.“They need to appreciate that unless they work with us to change the electoral system it’s possible that the Conservatives, particularly with the lack of strength of Labour in Scotland, are going to have a majority forever,” she said. “They need to get quite pragmatic about that, in my view.”The only other candidate to formally announce they are running for the Lib Dem leadership so far is Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, although Ed Davey, who took over as interim leader after Swinson lost her seat, seems certain to do so as well. Daisy Cooper, who won St Albans for the party in December, is also considering joining the race.Nominations do not open until 1 May, with voting among members not completed before mid-July.Moran said a key issue was developing new policy priorities, saying she had asked voters what they knew about the Lib Dems: “Unfortunately, for many of them, the answer is nothing.

It has also created confusion and anger across the game.Without proper consultation with other stakeholders in the game, the FFT announced that what is normally the season’s second grand slam tournament and was scheduled to run from 24 May to 7 June – less than a month after the conclusion of the blackout introduced by the ATP last week – would now become the fourth and final major, starting on 20 September.That is just a week after the US Open finishes and clashes with the Laver Cup, the popular and established exhibition team competition, featuring leading players from Europe and the rest of the world, and championed by Roger Federer and Nadal.Federer, the world No 4, who is recuperating from minor knee surgery and not due to resume playing until Wimbledon in July, has moved away from clay in recent years and would in any case be reluctant to sacrifice his involvement in the Laver Cup, which is slated for 25 to 27 September in Boston.The clash places Nadal, the French Open’s reigning and perennial master, in a more obviously embarrassing position. He too is a key figure in the Laver Cup’s Team Europe, along with Alexander Zverev – a client of Federer’s promotional company who chose to miss the ATP Cup in January to play exhibitions with the Swiss – Dominic Thiem and Stefanos Tsitsipas. But it is the Spaniard who is the king of Roland Garros. Without Nadal, the French Open is seriously diminished.Nick Kyrgios, a major draw, is an ever-present in the Laver Cup’s Team World, as areJohn Isner and Jack Sock, last year appearing alongside Milos Raonic, Denis Shapovalov and the rising young American, Taylor Fritz.The absence of such a stellar lineup would devalue the French Open if these plans go ahead – which is less than certain. At that time of the year, the tournament would most likely be played under the new roof, further detracting from its unique position in the game, in one of the sport’s most attractive settings.The outspoken young Canadian, Vasek Pospisil, tweeted: “This is madness: major announcement by Roland Garros changing the dates to one week after the US Open. No communication with the players or the ATP. We have ZERO say in this sport. It’s time.”With global sport in limbo, there is no guarantee any of the dates will be met, anyway, but there was widespread concern in the game the French had unilaterally turned the calendar on its head. It is understood urgent talks are scheduled for Wednesday morning between the FFT, the ATP and the WTA. The French are unlikely to receive a warm welcome. understands the USTA – the organisers of the US Open – the ATP and the WTA, who govern the men’s and women’s games, respectively, received little or no advance warning of the move by the often autocratic FFT.The announcement makes no mention of the obvious shared dilemma of many events on both the ATP and WTA Tours, none of whom are able to change dates. Furthermore, in the two weeks from 20 September, there are minor ATP tournaments in Metz, St Petersburg, Chengdu, Sofia, Zhuhai, Beijing and Tokyo. If the French insist on going alone, they are likely to make enemies at board level and in the locker room, not to mention at the gate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5ec56fd4138d3aa90f3904cffdfa1c592f5c580/0_200_5875_3525/master/5875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e34f48f28b5f4e353c984b7e2539b5","title":"coronavirus fans supporters amateur athletes coaches pandemic world","story":"Supporters, amateur athletes, coaches and officials from all over the world explain how the pandemic has affected themI’m a member of a League of Ireland football club. We are one of the better known clubs in the country and have a fair few season tickets. That is not the case for other clubs. Some are trying to stay afloat, especially in the country’s second tier. Matchdays are obviously big earners, whether that be tickets, food or drink. Some clubs can only budget day-to-day, with these influxes every fortnight keeping their heads above water. What happens when clubs have to go without this for a month – or even a whole season? How can they afford to play players without taking money in the gate?What has happened in the FAI, our national football association, has been well documented. The situation before the outbreak of Covid-19 was one of uncertainty. With everything already up in the air, can our league – especially smaller clubs, who are already teetering on the brink – survive a season with no fans, no football, and no funding?I booked to go to Munich for Chelsea’s game in the Champions League this week. The weekend away was meant to be my first break from work this year. I’m disappointed with how Chelsea have dealt with this. We saw Manchester United refund their travelling fans £350 for their Europa League match, a drop in the ocean for them and a great PR move.Chelsea, predictably, offered nothing of the sort. They immediately took the five loyalty points away and will refund the £53 ticket (let’s see if the booking fee is included) in 10 days. Ten days! United said they would do it in three. I was planning to go home to see my mum in Leicester for Mother’s Day and take her to Chelsea’s game there in the FA Cup. Now I’ll be stuck with family and no football. The horror! MarkI have season tickets for Sanfrecce Hiroshima in the J League (where the season was postponed after one game) and Hiroshima Toyo Carp in the Japanese Professional Baseball League (where the season has been delayed) I have bought tickets and booked flights for both Euro 2020 semi-finals (it looks like I will be having a football-free trip) and I have tickets to the Olympics in Tokyo (who knows). What was shaping to be a once in a lifetime summer of sport now looks bleak. RobertWhile I feel for the fans of the bigger clubs – in particular those Liverpool fans who may see their long-awaited league title delayed or won with no fans in attendance – I fear even more for smaller clubs across the country, for whom a sudden break in income could potentially be catastrophic. Matches can be delayed and leagues can be won later, but there will likely be no coming back for those unlucky clubs who find themselves simply unable to continue. I hope mine is not one of those, but I would be amazed if there are not at least a few clubs for whom this could be the end. MichaelI’m living in northern Italy at the moment in the town of Riva del Garda. I play for the local rugby team, Rugby Benacense, and we were having an incredible season. So far, we are unbeaten and have two more games left of the regular season before the playoffs. Unfortunately, the league has been suspended indefinitely and no training has taken place since 25 February. It’s a shame that the season has just came to a halt, but I support the measures to try to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. HarjanI started training for the Manchester marathon at the beginning of December and it has now been cancelled. After training for the last 15 weeks, with just three weeks left to go, I’m now thinking about what can I do instead. Do I run my own marathon at my goal pace so not to waste my training? How do I go about keeping my fitness up without needing to repeat the 18-week training plan for when it is rescheduled? Will I be able to attend the new date? Then there is the potential for monetary loss from travel tickets, accommodation and entry fee. There is nothing I can do and I have to accept it is a part of life that unfortunate events disrupt even the best laid plans, but you cannot help but feel frustrated.I coach rugby in Italy and work with grassroots clubs, helping them develop their business, especially with regards to sponsors and community connections. Rugby has come to a stop here, with all activities suspended and clubs closed. Clubs are now in lockdown, which is having an enormous impact on their finances. We’re waiting to hear the future for this year’s Top 12 championship – will it be be cancelled, postponed or will there be some other creative solution?On a bright side, lots of coaches are being very creative and giving kids rugby homework such as stories to write, pictures to draw, problems to solve, quizzes and opportunities to explore rugby’s core values. Anything to keep them busy and thinking about rugby. We’re in national lockdown and housebound except in order to shop for food and medicine. Very strange times!I’m a lifelong Liverpool fan. I’ve been waiting for a season like this all my life. I’ve never had the chance to see them play at Anfield. At the start of the season, me and a bunch of friends got tickets for Liverpool’s last game at Anfield against Chelsea. We have booked a hotel and flights. Right now I’m very worried that it will all be for nothing and we won’t be able to see the game or even visit Liverpool. I think I might have some dust in my eyes.Just a couple days before the outbreak arrived in Europe, I made plans with a friend to go to Italy on a football-themed weekend. It would be my first time in the country and I was going to attend two matches in a day: Atalanta v Lazio and Inter v Brescia. I could not have chosen a worst region. LeonardoI am the chairman of a small rugby club in London. At first you go about your business thinking this does not require any response from you or the club and suddenly it dawns on you. Simple things like, how do we ensure we have enough soap and hand sanitiser when all the shops seem empty of them? Our small budget cannot stand too many deep cleans.We are in our regional vase final in the middle of April. There will be three matches so approaching 200 players and officials sharing changing rooms, plus potentially hundreds of supporters in the bar. Will that go ahead? What about our end-of-season tour? We are not a wealthy club. We cannot afford to hire a coach and then have that postponed.How do we monitor our own players – let alone the opposition? How do we know if someone has been in contact with someone who has been affected by the virus? Our players are young, fit and healthy (though looking at some of our front rows you might wonder) but quite a few work at the nearby airport where there is a higher risk of contact.Suddenly, retiring and giving your time to help out at a community club becomes a little more serious than just doing a shift behind the bar. It becomes about doing your best, with little professional advice, to protect the bunch of people who rely on their club as part of what they do.I have a season ticket at Arsenal and was told on 3 March that I should not go to crowded places until the number of cases in England starts to fall. I’m 34 and I have cystic fibrosis. Catching coronavirus at a match (or anywhere) would be an absolute disaster for me because my lungs are already compromised due to low lung function.I have no choice but to following the medical advice. The bigger picture isn’t great either. With no coronavirus vaccine on the horizon for another 12 months or more, I’m starting to accept that it could be a really long time before I am back in a stadium again. The risks will remain high until there’s a vaccine.I live in Michigan and follow European football very closely. Seeing all these leagues being postponed and held behind closed doors is insane. I don’t think anyone has ever really lived through something like this, so the precaution is necessary. As much as I love this sport, unfortunately this is the right call. The coronavirus has shown us all that health is bigger than any sporting event and that taking precautions early can help stop the virus from spreading rapidly.I will miss spending my weekend mornings watching football. All anyone can hope for is the wellbeing of the people affected, that authorities control the spread and find a possible vaccine. Until then football will be missed by millions. Hopefully leagues will be able to finish their seasons in the near future. DianaI have been planning a month-long trip to Italy during April and May to watch Inter, Bologna, Fiorentina and Napoli play. Given everything that is happening, I suspect my trip might be a non-starter. I have tickets a train to Turin and three games, but have no idea if I’ll be able to get my money back. BenI had planned to go and see Rangers in Germany against Leverkusen. I have had an extremely tough year as I had a liver transplant last August. For the majority of this season I have followed Rangers from the couch as I have been recovering, but having the chance to see us away in Europe again was exciting! I am devastated. I will just have to hope Rangers can get into the next round.I’m from Poland and have been planning a trip to London with my son and my dad, who made the decision to go abroad for the first time in his entire life. As he’s football fan I decided to take him to the Millwall v Swansea game to experience some old school British football atmosphere. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak we have been forced to cancel the whole trip. We’ve lost money on plane tickets and accommodation, so I hope to get refund on game tickets at least. KonradIt’s not as high stakes as a lot of other sports fans I’m sure, but my fantasy Six Nations league has been completely upended as a result of coronavirus. We had organised a fairly big prize at the end and now none of us can decide how we can resolve it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc744f13cde1e07e4a7dc997d63c3b25ec1cb20c/0_440_5024_3013/master/5024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eb847250ec4dbc5327d122779fc4071","title":"new england patriots tom brady leaves nfl football boston","story":"With the departure of the New England Patriots quarterback, it’s hard not to think that an era has come to an end for a legion of fans who loved himIt was already set to be the most surreal St Patrick’s Day in modern Massachusetts memory. There would be no parade in the Irish-American stronghold of South Boston and there would be no drinking or eating in local bars and restaurants, by order of the governor. There was a pandemic to slow down, after all, and there was no time for fun and games. Literally, in fact, as the Celtics, Bruins and Red Sox had all suspended play for the foreseeable future. So things were already set to be bleak on Tuesday morning even before New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady made the announcement that he will leave the only organization he has ever played for. In a few sentences, Brady effectively closed the book on his Patriots tenure and an entire era of Boston sports.Nobody expected anything from Brady when the Patriots drafted him out of the University of Michigan with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft. It was inconceivable that he would develop into one of the greatest players – many will tell you the best – in NFL history. Brady began his rookie season as the fourth-string quarterback, a role that barely exists in the modern game. Head coach Bill Belichick seemed to have an idea of what he had early in Brady’s second season when he made the fateful decision to turn to him to replace an injured Drew Bledsoe, then the face of the franchise. Brady would go on to win 11 of the 14 games he started in the 2001 season, eventually leading the team to victory over the St Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. New England would clear up any further quarterback controversy by trading Bledsoe to Buffalo Bills over the offseason. From that moment on, Brady was the Patriots.Brady’s emergence marked the start of the Patriots dynasty, as the team would go on to be the most consistently successful team in the NFL. Under Belichick’s guidance, Brady would eventually appear in a record nine Super Bowls, winning six of them and being named MVP in four. The Patriots’ success ended up being contagious. Following the Patriots’ second Super Bowl in 2004, the Boston Red Sox reversed 86 years of agony by winning the 2004 World Series, the first of what would be four championships in the 21st century. The Boston Celtics and Boston Bruins, after substantial title droughts, became perennial postseason threats, winning titles in 2008 and 2011 respectively.In the midst of all this success and countless celebratory Duck Boat parades down Boylston Street, it was inevitable that Brady’s public image would transform. It soon became difficult to remember that Brady’s career began as the all-time underdog story, the sixth-round draft pick who replaced the star quarterback and led his team to an unlikely Super Bowl victory. The one-time David soon became the league’s ultimate Goliath, as the constant winning transformed the team into the most hated team in the league. A run at a perfect season in 2007, memorably shut down by Eli Manning and the New York Giants in the first of their two upset Super Bowl victories over the Pats, cemented New England’s role as heels. That role was exacerbated by a series of cheating scandals that called into question the legitimacy of the Patriots dynasty. Brady’s career has not remained untainted as the NFL suspended him for four games at the start of the 2016 season for using improperly inflated footballs.Outside of New England, there will probably always be something of a black mark on Brady’s career. Inside of New England, the main thing fans took away from the “Deflategate” scandal was that the quarterback “stuck it to” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell by coming back from his suspension to win his fifth Super Bowl, adding a sixth just two years later. If anything, the negative press caused fans to rally around Brady even harder. As popular opinion built against the Patriots over the years, an “Us v Them” narrative began to form among Boston fans. “They hate us because they ain’t us,” became a constant refrain and Tom Brady was very much Us.Until now, that is. Brady leaving the Patriots marks the decisive end of an era, one that would be shocking if the writing hadn’t been on the wall over the course of the 2019 season. After years of holding off Father Time, the 42-year-old Brady was starting to show his age over the last year – for one of the few times in his career he wasn’t even chosen for the Pro Bowl – and his disappointing offensive year was a key reason why the Patriots ended up losing to the Tennessee Titans in the first-round of the playoffs. Something that had worked so well for so long just couldn’t function anymore, and now free agency has torn Brady and the team apart.So where do the Patriots go from here? It’s possible that losing Brady could end up forcing the Patriots to move onto a brand new era of success. Bill Belichick has won six championships with the team – and has established himself as one of the greatest head coaches in NFL history, despite his sometimes ethically dubious methods – so one would think that there would be no trails left for him to blaze. Yet, one thing has always hung over Belichick’s success in New England: how much of it was because of his “genius” and how much was it was that he had Brady. If he could win one last Super Bowl with a new quarterback, it would go a long way towards settling that argument. Maybe it will turn out that the Patriots dynasty wasn’t as much about Brady as it seemed.But another title in the near future feels highly unlikely. Brady and Belichick represented a perfect football marriage where the sum was ultimately greater than the parts. Even a declining Brady will prove nearly impossible to replace. The Patriots should still be competitive going forward, but it’s hard to avoid the feeling that a golden age of Boston sports has come to a sudden end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63e33044ab9b431f127257bd580d320579797bdd/20_0_5158_3095/master/5158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d03faa2c22f2c0f21d37f16fab0497","title":"readers tips visit wildlife nature reserve uk sawdays stay","story":"Whether it’s a wetlands, mountainside, coastal fringe, forest or heath … share details of your favourite UK nature reserveAs with all attractions, some wildlife reserves may be closed during the coronavirus outbreak.

Ohio, which was also due to vote on Tuesday, postponed its elections, defying a court order and closing polls, even as Florida, Illinois and Arizona moved forward in spite of pressure to delay their contests.Before polls closed on Tuesday, Sanders delivered an address responding to the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn “to prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe” and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.“Our country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,” he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths as of Tuesday evening. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a “terrible” precedent.DeWine instructed the state’s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.“We should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,” DeWine said at a press conference, adding: “I think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.”Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing “more chaos and confusion” and sought to discourage other states from following suit.But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting. But there were reports of poll worker shortages and confusion over polling locations.The virus has reshaped the 2020 election campaign in other ways. Trump is not holding his signature rallies and the Democratic candidates, both in their late 70s, are forgoing big gatherings, opting instead to hold virtual town halls and live-streamed events. On the eve of the latest primaries, Sanders participated in a digital rally from his hometown of Burlington, while Biden held a “tele-town hall”.The election delays have added another layer of unpredictability to a primary that has seen months of twists and surprises. Simon Rosenberg, a veteran consultant and the president of the New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, said coronavirus presented an “unprecedented” challenge for the party.“Democrats now must to find a way to complete this primary given the uncertainty of when each state is going to vote and whether we’re even going to be able to have a convention in July,” he said.In recent weeks, exit polls found that voters trust Biden more to handle a major crisis. He entered Tuesday with a lead of more than 150 delegates. But Sanders, the frontrunner after the Nevada caucuses in February, faced a narrow path to the nomination that would have required him to greatly outperform expectations in states he lost in 2016.Padding his delegate lead further, Biden was also finally declared the winner of last week’s primary in Washington, a state Sanders hoped to win.Lifted by a hasty alignment of the party’s establishment, Biden has built a coalition on the strength of his support from African Americans and older voters. But Sanders continues to dominate with young voters, a constituency the former vice-president will need in the general election.In his remarks on Tuesday night, Biden made an explicit appeal to Sanders’ loyal supporters.“I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do,” he said. “Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.“Senator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision,” Biden said, before running through a list of issues Sanders and his supporters have championed, including healthcare, income inequality and the climate crisis.“Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,” Biden said. “So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president, is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.”Daniel Strauss contributed to this story"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e28c3cea9f43f2fe92e950e8c838924fc8bc6d0/0_233_3498_2100/master/3498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=105a962a170d2fa6356a2cfecbe8458b","title":"australians are you trying to return home due to coronavirus","story":"We want to hear from Britons and anyone else overseas who are trying to travel back home As countries close their borders around the world, the Australian government has urged Australians abroad to return home as soon as possible.

Myanmar’s southern neighbour, Thailand, has reported 114 cases.Attempting to explain the anomaly, a spokesperson for Myanmar’s government has claimed that people’s “lifestyle and diet” protected them from the disease – stoking concerns the country is downplaying the impact of the respiratory illness.Zaw Htay, a government spokesperson, also said the common use of cash instead of credit cards, helped curb the spread of the illness. There is no evidence to show that diet or banknotes can stop the spread of coronavirus.“Such irresponsible statements clash with everything known about the coronavirus outbreak, defy reality, and only serve to give a false sense of security to the country’s people about the disease and their risks of infection,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia ision at Human Rights Watch, in a blog post.Ten patients in Myanmar are currently in quarantine awaiting test results, according to the government.Globally, there are more than 161,500 confirmed coronavirus cases in 150 countries or territories. The World Health Organization said the global threat from the respiratory illness is high.“The government’s public lack of concern has sparked rumours and speculation about the government’s response, leaving many distrustful and unable to make informed decisions for their families,” Robertson said.Aung Aung, a surgeon at Mandalay general hospital in Myanmar, told the New York Times: “I don’t think Myanmar has the modern techniques to know whether the virus is here.”Facing questions from reporters, Zaw Htay acknowledged scepticism about the government’s claim there are no coronavirus cases in the country, but insisted it was accurate.Even without any reported cases, the government has banned festivals and entertainment events in April, including the Thingyan festival, the biggest annual holiday in the country.The government has also started a fund to raise money from the public to support its response to the illness.“I urge those of you who would like to donate to give as much as you can,” said Aung San Suu Kyi."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af6a07d8ba3d1e3fa4793bb69445b9c74188bd6d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7e1906e32956450ecdc9888fdaceffe","title":"testing for coronavirus what being done in uk","story":"Tests are mostly taking place in hospitals but there are calls to massively scale up effortsAs of last week, when the prime minister announced Britain was no longer in the “contain” phase of the pandemic, most testing outside of hospitals stopped. People with symptoms are expected to self-isolate but will not know whether they have Covid-19. That means they will not know if they are immune or still at risk – and a risk to other people.Testing now mostly takes place in hospital. People in intensive care units and those with respiratory illness, especially if it is pneumonia, will get tested for Covid-19. When there is a cluster of infections, such as an outbreak in a care home, those people will also be tested.The World Health Organization has criticised the approach of countries that are not prioritising testing, with its director general saying “you cannot fight a fire blindfolded … test, test, test”.In late February, Public Health England said 100 GP practices had agreed to perform random coronavirus testing of people with symptoms – consistent coughs and a fever. That was just to monitor the spread of the virus, however, in the same way PHE monitors the spread of flu.They are not being tested. Many of them are extremely disturbed by that. They are exposed to the infection through patients, some of whom will be admitted to hospital before anyone suspects they have the virus. They are very worried that they could spread the disease to their patients and take it home to their families. Without a test, they say, they do not know what to do if they or a member of their family begins to cough.A junior doctor in an emergency assessment unit has started a petition, called “Test frontline NHS staff for Covid-19 as a priority”, which has so far attracted nearly 700,000 signatures.It appears to be a capacity issue, although the Department of Health and Social Care failed to respond to repeated requests for explanation. So far there have been about 44,000 tests in England, which the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the health select committee put it in “the top three or four countries in terms of testing”. PHE has a capacity of about 4,000 tests per day, he said, although last week NHS England put out a press release saying it was scaling up to 10,000 a day. Vallance said 4,000 a day “is clearly not going to be enough going forward” and said there was “a very big effort going on to try and ramp that up”.He said healthcare workers were among the “key workers” they wanted to be able to test – but it is clear that will not happen very soon. Asked if the UK should have mass testing on the scale of South Korea, which has tested more than 250,000 people out of a population of 51 million, and is bringing infections down, Vallance said: “I think we need a big increase in testing. That’s what I’m pushing for very hard. Everyone is working hard to try and make that happen.”At the moment, the NHS has only a test that can detect the virus in a nasal swab through laboratory analysis, which takes 24 hours at best. That tells us whether somebody’s illness is Covid-19. What the NHS wants is a test that can detect antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19, which would mean they were likely to be immune. No country is currently confirmed to have this test.Yes. They are being offered at nearly £400 a time. Celebrities such as Idris Elba and some footballers appear to have paid for them. PHE says it has not validated and approved any private tests, and there may be some that are bogus. However, Vallance has also said the government was looking at all possible providers of an antibody test for the NHS, including the private sector.A number of companies appear to be making tests on a large scale. One in Belfast is supplying tests to Europe and across the world. A British company is said to be making tests to export to Senegal. So far, the health department, PHE and NHS England have not said whether they have any plans to ramp up their supplies by buying from these or other companies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c6b740a7a54554c777ca47e447cafe67fd8c40/0_160_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b69bf4f201ff31c690d95408105eb486","title":"us government to give citizens emergency financial aid","story":"White House prepares to send direct payments to Americans as part of stimulus packageDonald Trump has dramatically stepped up the US government’s response to the coronavirus outbreak by announcing plans to send cheques directly to American citizens to give them emergency financial aid, while agreeing to purchase up to $1tn (£830bn) of corporate bonds.The White House said it was preparing to send the payments to Americans within two weeks as part of a vast stimulus package to shore-up confidence in the world’s largest economy as the efforts to contain the disease threaten a global recession.At a special briefing in Washington, the the US Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said: “This is stuff that needs to be done now. The president has instructed me, this is no fault to American workers, for medical reasons we’re shutting down.”Speaking after the Republican senator, Mitt Romney, proposed sending $1,000 cheques, Mnuchin said the value of the payments would be “bigger than what’s in the press”.The handouts are part of a wider $850bn stimulus package the Trump administration is negotiating with Congress. The bank bailout package agreed at the time of the financial crisis – known as Tarp – was worth $700bn.The US Federal Reserve will also invest $10bn to a special purpose vehicle to provide guarantees that the central bank would purchase up to $1tn of US corporate bonds if required, aiming to smooth the financial markets after weeks of turmoil.Mnuchin also said the White House planned to allow inidual taxpayers to defer payments of up to $1m and for companies of up to $10m, in steps that could cost the government as much as $300bn.Speaking alongside Mnuchin at the press conference, Trump said: “We’re going big. We want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days. “We want to go big – we want to go solid. The country’s strong. With this invisible enemy, we don’t want airlines going out of business or people not having jobs and being able to live, when they were doing OK four weeks ago.”“We have ways of getting out money in many ways, very quickly and very actively.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81791a29ab365ccd1ff984b1a20f095bdf185aac/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae62c4810a7a540f6fcd7a73db2dac32","title":"arms industry staff seconded into key roles at uk department for trade","story":"Concerns raised after FoI request reveals arms firms’ employees in influential government postsEmployees of some of the world’s largest arms companies have been on secondments to influential positions within the UK’s Department for International Trade, a freedom of information (FoI) request has revealed.They include employees of BAE and the missile maker MBDA whose influence on British government policy towards its Saudi government clients has long been highly controversial.Roles taken those from arms companies on secondment to the department include “developing country strategies for industry markets”. Other arms companies that have staff seconded to the government include QinetiQ, General Dynamics UK and Babcock.An FoI request by the  showed that staff on secondment included a General Dynamics UK employee who was placed as a “fusion director” inside the department’s global trade and investment group until last week.An MBDA employee was seconded to a position in the same departmental group during 2018 and 2019 as a “country strategy lead”, while an employee of QinetiQ was seconded until late last year.Two BAE employees were in positions – the titles were “stakeholder and communications” and “country strategy lead” during 2018 and 2019 in the same departmental group. Two Babcock employees had secondments during the same years as well.The shadow secretary of state for international trade, Barry Gardiner, said: “These revelations confirm what many have long feared – that much of the government’s approach to developing export market growth and free trade agreements appears to have been designed by staff brought in from the arms industry and big oil.“As we face an international climate crisis and humanitarian emergencies in countries like Yemen, it’s deeply troubling that the government’s export strategy seems to be built around support for fossil fuels and arms sales. This is not what global Britain should represent.“At a time when the arms licensing system has already been exposed as unfit for purpose after the failure to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, these findings raise further concerns.Amnesty International called for a review of such secondments. Oliver Feeley-Sprague, Amnesty International UK’s arms expert, added: “Secondments aren’t in themselves improper, but a systematic programme of ‘embedding’ arms industry representatives in government departments smacks of over-cosiness.“The UK’s dysfunctional arms export licensing system desperately needs overhauling. We need a thorough review of whether secondments are undermining the integrity and independence of human rights protections designed to ensure ministers and officials aren’t subject to undue commercial influence.”A spokesperson for the Department for International Trade said: “DIT’s trade policy is determined by the secretary of state. It is not unusual for industry specialists from a wide range of sectors to be seconded into government.”A separate FoI by the  showed that recent secondments to the Cabinet Office included employees of Carillion, the construction giant that went into liquidation in 2018 putting thousands of jobs at risk across the UK, and Costain, which was one of the key contractors in line to benefit from HS2.Both were seconded to the Cabinet Office’s infrastructure projects authority group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The number of deaths from coronavirus around the world has risen to 7,948, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Infections, meanwhile, are nearing 200,000: the site says there are now 198,006 recorded cases worldwide with 81,950 patients recovered so far.People around the world have begun racing to find a way to their home countries after nations began closing their borders, airlines cut flights and governments urged their citizens to return home. On Tuesday, Australia warned that overseas travel was becoming “more complex and difficult” and joined Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates in calling back its citizens.The US death toll passed 100 as coronavirus reached every state. California governor Gavin Newsom warned that most schools in the state will likely remain closed for the rest of the school year – until the end of August – because of coronavirus.Shares in the Japanese firm Fujifilm have shot up after medical authorities said a drug developed to treat new strains of influenza appeared to be effective in coronavirus patients. Fujifilm, best known for its photographic products, also makes favipiravir, which had produced encouraging outcomes in clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen involving 340 patients, according to Zhang Xinmin, an official at China’s science and technology ministry.Authorities have said non-residents will be banned from entering the country from midnight. The restrictions exclude diplomats and holders of alien resident certificates.Two Canadian provinces have called a state of emergency, including the country’s most populous province, Ontario. It came as British Columbia announced another 83 confirmed cases on Tuesday, bringing the province’s total confirmed Covid-19 infections to 186. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is expected to unveil a multibillion-dollar stimulus package on Wednesday.Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has stepped up the country’s response to the coronavirus crisis by announcing sweeping new measures to try to slow the spread of coronavirus, including a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, a global do-not-travel order, and strict new rules for visiting aged care homes. Amid continued evidence of panic-buying at supermarkets, he pleaded with people to stop hoarding, calling it “un-Australian”. Thousands of Australians have been left stranded overseas, as airlines cancel flights, and countries across the globe shut their borders entirely in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.The virus can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the symptoms as experiencing either:No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 18 March, more than 198,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 7,950 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 79,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05fd2ab939e86ec301215650a33ca6b5ac050ded/0_55_1944_1167/master/1944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b98c4931a9dfd8d0fa0dc1976bbc02f3","title":"covid 19s deserted landscapes then and now","story":"As countries close borders and bring in curfews, photographs reveal the impact of coronavirusBeirut’s Corniche promenade in Lebanon.

But for months, the farm where he works 12 miles east of Havana, hasn’t had any diesel.“It’s something to cry about, but we find ways to laugh,” said Rodríguez, pulling a wet cigar from his mouth. “We Cubans are like that – even with a bullet in the neck we keep laughing.”Cuba is short of oil. In an effort to strangle its most indefatigable and intimate communist foe, the US has since April sanctioned tanker companies delivering petroleum to Cuba from Venezuela, its closest ally.Just outside Havana, Misael Ponce, 43, manages a milk farm, which like many others embraced agro-ecology in the 1990s after the Soviet Union disintegrated and the island was left without imported animal feed, insecticides and fertilisers.“It was a subsistence mechanism that we had to adopt,” said Ponce. All of the livestock’s fodder is grown on site to reduce dependency on the world outside. Oxen usually till half the soil (their manure is used as fertiliser), while a 67-year-old American tractor ploughs the rest.But with the tractor out of action, the oxen now prepare the soil alone. Ponce thinks he can grow all the mulberry, king-grass and sugar cane he needs to feed the cows, and is confident he can hit his production target.But he acknowledges his farmhands are now working much longer hours: “What you can do with a tractor in an hour, you do with an ox in a day.”Others are less able to cope.In the neighbouring province of Mayabeque, Leonardo Suárez’s tractor sits idle. He has no draught animals.“Where, in today’s world, does agriculture function without petrol?” he asks rhetorically.Normally Suárez, a former aviation engineer, cultivates black beans, but he says that is impossible at scale without tractors or animals, so now he is planting cabbage and lettuce by hand: “If this situation continues I’ll rent some oxen to plough a spot of land just for me and my family – because I’m not going to die of hunger!”When the US embargo on Cuba was introduced in the 1960s the goal, according to the US Department of State, was to “bring about hunger, desperation, and overthrow of the government”. For six decades that goal has failed: Cuba is one of the only countries in Latin America to have all but eliminated hunger, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.State grocery stores (bodegas) guarantee all Cubans vital goods – such as rice, black beans, oil and a whole lot of sugar – at symbolic prices. Children are allocated three kilograms of powdered milk a month until they are seven. According to Unicef, policies like this explain why the island is one of the few countries in the hemisphere to have eliminated child malnutrition.But the basic rations are often not enough and Cubans have grown accustomed to searching for items such as meat, cheese and ketchup.Now, farmers worry about further impacts the petrol blockade could have on food.“If this situation continues, I don’t even want to think about what will happen,” says Ponce.Like so much else in Cuba, the government sees food as a question of national security. Only the state is permitted to slaughter cows (the population of which has reduced dramatically since the 1990s) farmers who butcher cows to sell on the black market can be imprisoned for up to a decade.To stave off inflation, the government in August imposed price controls on food, a popular measure ensuring those earning meagre public sector salaries can just about afford a balanced diet. But economists say that if left in place too long, price controls reduce agricultural production in the private sector.Over the past 12 months, the US has hit Cuba with the most potent sanctions in half a century. Dreams of a more prosperous future that followed the Obama administration’s rapprochement with the island seem a distant memory.For now, essential foodstuffs are in stock at bodegas, and monthly rations of eggs, spam and chicken are arriving on time. But away from the lifeline planned economy, scarcity is increasing.When rumours swirl that a consignment of hotdogs has arrived, day-long queues can form outside shopping malls.In January the government cut cooking gas rations after the US sanctioned the state energy company which imports liquid petroleum gas.In February, the minister for commerce, Betsy Díaz, told the population to brace for shortages of personal hygiene products due to “serious financial limitations”. Buying more fuel on the open market, she said, has forced the government to “choose between maintaining stable food supplies” and products for people’s cleanliness.Toothpaste is out of stock throughout the east of the island. Soap was already in short supply before people could stock up – and the news that four cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the island has only heightened concerns that the sanctions may have mortal ramifications.On a recent Saturday, plantains, cassava and muddy lettuces were stacked high at a market stall in Centro Havana. But black beans – which together with rice form the mainstay of the Cuban diet – have been out of stock all season.“There’s been less fuel assigned to the lorries so we’ve had less stock coming in,” said one vendor who didn’t want to give his name for fear of reprisals.“The crisis doesn’t affect me,” said Beatriz de la Caridad Domínguez, 23, at the same market stall. “If there’s no tomato, I eat plantain – I find a solution for everything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ad5f225b5b75d66a126e67ead62b6a4ddb23a8/118_0_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f7232f7f7cb63010bb9eaa3569632d","title":"health workers targeted at least 120 times yemen conflict","story":"Analysis reveals devastating impact from warring parties on country’s hospitals and doctors Hospitals and doctors in Yemen have been targeted at least 120 times by the conflict’s warring parties, according to a report that gives the most comprehensive analysis to date of the devastating effect of war on the country’s healthcare system.There were 120 incidents across 20 of Yemen’s 22 govern​orates between March 2015 and December 2018, including airstrikes, ground attacks, military occupation, assaults on health workers and other violations such as looting and restrictions on humanitarian aid, according to analysis co-published by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) and the Yemeni human rights group Mwatana on Wednesday.The findings come as a relative lull in the violence appears to have ended and Yemen’s already decimated medical sector is bracing for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak.The collapse of Yemen’s healthcare system has been a major contributing factor in creating what the UN says is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, with two thirds of the 28 million-strong population dependent on aid to survive, widespread hunger and outbreaks of cholera and diptheria.“What our report shows is how blatantly international humanitarian law has been ignored in Yemen’s conflict and how in particular attacking healthcare facilities has a long-term and wide-reaching impact,” said Osamah Alfakih, Mwatana’s advocacy director, who co-authored the report.“All the warring parties have displayed a sustained recklessness for civilian life.”Interviews with nearly 200 survivors and eyewitnesses identified patterns of attacks and specific violations that killed at least 96 civilians and healthcare workers and injured 230 more.The report could be used in future war crimes investigations against the Saudi- and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore the exiled Yemeni government, the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and various other armed groups.The report also criticises the coalition for a lack of transparency in its operations, adding that “it remains unclear what precautions the coalition has adopted to minimise harm to Yemen’s health facilities and personnel”.Among its recommendations the investigation says the UK, US, Canada, France and other countries currently facilitating weaponry and support to the coalition should immediately suspend sales contingent on respect for international humanitarian law in the coalition’s Yemen operations and comprehensive efforts to investigate alleged crimes and violations.The use of mortars and artillery by the Houthis and other non-state actors in Yemen in densely populated areas has also damaged and destroyed healthcare facilities, the report said, while Houthi occupation of such buildings pointed to a more deliberate violation of their protected status.Attacks on hospitals and clinics have closed more than half of Yemen’s pre-war facilities and the constant threat of being targeted makes it very difficult for doctors and nurses to work, Alfakih said.Al-Thawra hospital in Taiz was the target of at least 45 documented attacks by several parties, including ground-launched attacks, armed incursions and looting. In August 2015, the facility was targeted eight times and hit with 22 shells in two days.“Even those hospitals that remain open lack specialists, equipment and medicine. We currently only have 10 healthcare workers per 10,000 people instead of the standard 22. If one medical worker is arrested, injured or killed that has a huge knock-on effect,” Alfakih said.“There are very brave healthcare professionals working in Yemen right now. Even if they don’t talk about how tired they are, the toll is clear in their faces and their eyes.”The analysis of the state of Yemen’s healthcare infrastructure comes amid heavy fighting in al-Jawf province after months of relative quiet that many hoped could lead to a more permanent de-escalation in the conflict.Coalition airstrikes in al-Jawf launched in retaliation after the Houthis shot down a warplane killed more than 30 civilians last month. On 1 March, the Houthis seized al-Jawf’s capital, al-Hazm, sending tens of thousands of people fleeing to neighbouring Marib.On Tuesday, Saudi state media reported that the coalition destroyed two explosive-laden boats in the Red Sea launched and remotely controlled by the Houthis from the coastal region of Hodeidah.Worries are also mounting that Covid-19 could have a catastrophic impact if it reaches vulnerable communities in Yemen.This week the International Rescue Committee (IRC) launched an emergency campaign to raise $30m (£25m) to help refugees, people displaced in their own countries and those living in nations with weak health systems respond to the coronavirus pandemic.The virus could “thrive in active war zones like Yemen and Syria, putting the lives of thousands of civilians in even more danger,” said the IRC president, David Miliband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87edd890074c21fdde9e4cf7ac64bf418e6b0ba0/318_0_4108_2465/master/4108.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3c23a6949f79f92e31c3fd277bf1b9","title":"keep it clean the surprising 130 year history of handwashing","story":"Until the mid-1800s, doctors didn’t bother washing their hands – they would go from dissecting a cadaver to delivering a child.

And all our leader had was this?As one of the few things we can do to significantly stop the spread of coronavirus while out in the infectious world, the new rules for this everyday habit have become the meme du jour. The Killers’ frontman, Brandon Flowers, tweeted a video of himself lathering up while crooning his hit Mr Brightside to 4 million followers. Judi Dench and Gyles Brandreth have posted themselves online reciting The Owl and the Pussycat with sudsy hands. A website for generating handwashing infographics to the song lyrics of your choice has gone viral.To Nancy Tomes, a distinguished professor of history at Stony Brook University, New York, seeing this basic advice headlining the public health agenda has felt even more strange. “Being a historian of this kind of pandemic event and then experiencing this one,” she says, “is kind of like being a passenger on the Titanic and watching it all unfold.” It also feels, she says, like going back to the early 20th century, when infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and smallpox were the No 1 cause of death, and the new science of germs had led to the first mass obsession with hand hygiene.Religious handwashing rituals have been around for thousands of years in Islamic, Jewish and other cultures, but the notion of disease spreading by hand has been part of the medical belief system for only about 130 years. However, the first recorded discovery of handwashing’s life-saving power came 50 years earlier, in 1848, as a huge, unwelcome shock.“If there had to be a father of handwashing it would be Ignaz Semmelweis,” says Miryam Wahrman, a professor of biology at William Paterson University in New Jersey and author of The Hand Book: Surviving in a Germ-Filled World. While working at Vienna General hospital, the Hungarian doctor was at the forefront of a more scientific approach to medicine. Faced with a doctor-led maternity ward in which maternal deaths from the dreaded childbed fever were significantly higher than in the midwife-run clinic there, he racked his brain for clues as to why.Germs were yet to be discovered, and it was still believed in the 1840s that disease was spread by miasma – bad smells in the air – emanating from rotting corpses, sewage or vegetation. Victorians kept their windows firmly shut against such malevolent forces. So it didn’t seem a problem that trainee doctors at Vienna General would hang out in the morgue dissecting corpses to figure out what had rendered them dead and then pop up to the maternity ward to deliver a baby without washing their hands.One of them then accidentally got cut by a scalpel during a dissection and died, seemingly of the same childbed fever the mothers had been getting. Semmelweis hypothesised that cadaverous particles from the morgue were to blame, and that such particles on the hands of doctors were making their way into women’s bodies during childbirth.Despite his success, his idea faced great resistance, and met a tragic end. He lost his job, and is thought to have had a breakdown. He died in a psychiatric institution, “a very despondent person at the untimely age of 47”, says Wahrman.Part of the problem, says Tomes, was that people, “didn’t have that conception of themselves as sort of walking petri dishes”. And doctors were offended by the suggestion that they could be causing infections. “The majority of doctors in Vienna at this time were from middle- or upper-class families, and they thought of themselves as very clean people compared with the working-class poor. He was insulting them when he said their hands could be dirty.”Over the next 40 years, an understanding of germs developed, and attitudes to hygiene gradually shifted. In 1857, while Semmelweis’s mental health declined, Louis Pasteur, of pasteurisation fame, raised awareness of pathogens, and how to kill them with heat. In 1876, the German scientist Robert Koch discovered the anthrax bacillus, kicking off the new research field of medical bacteriology. Cholera, tuberculosis, diphtheria and typhoid bacilli were subsequently identified.Surgeons started handwashing in earnest. Tomes says: “If you’re cutting open someone’s skin – that protective layer – you need to take extraordinary precautions.” The British surgeon Joseph Lister pioneered antiseptic surgery, which included handwashing, “and by the 1890s and into the early 1900s,” adds Tomes, “handwashing moved from being something doctors did to something everybody had been told to do”.Florence Nightingale helped. Despite still labouring under miasma theory, she intuitively improved hygiene in military hospitals during the Crimean war in the 1850s and, after returning to the UK, set about revolutionising nursing. “Nightingale influenced a new interest in household cleanliness as a goal that a good wife and mother needs to instil in her family,” says Tomes.The turn of the century saw the first popular public health campaigns being launched around tuberculosis, says Tomes. “Koch had shown that tuberculosis was not something you inherited from your grandmother, but that your grandmother coughed on you, and that’s why you got it.” The anti-tuberculosis movement was aimed at both adults and schoolchildren. “You really were getting little kids taught these rules about being clean and washing your hands.”Tomes adds: “People got totally phobic about shaking hands or kissing each other when they understood that their mouth, their skin and their hair had all these germs on them.” It’s one reason, she says, why young men started eschewing beards at the turn of the century. And why foods started being sold inidually wrapped, because of “this fear of germs and hands touching things”. But this hygiene-centric era was short-lived.The combination of public health messaging and the development of vaccines and antibiotics in the early 20th century saw death rates from bacterial diseases plummet. “The hyperattention to this kind of cleanliness became less important,” says Tomes. “A laxity crept in, I think, in healthcare and in everyday life after the second world war.”Sexually transmitted diseases started increasing again in the 1970s. “People started to realise, well, these things can come back if we get careless,” says Tomes. “But it was really with HIV coming in the 1980s – a novel, deadly, sneaky kind of virus – that everyone started to get hyper again about personal cleanliness.” Even though, of course, HIV is transmitted by blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk, so hand hygiene isn’t a significant factor in prevention, Tomes says we have been operating with a more aware mindset in general since then. Hospital superbugs became a problem, “and now we have these novel viruses coming pretty regularly, but we’re also getting the re-emergence of bacterial diseases because of antibiotic resistance”.How effective is handwashing? Petra Klepac, an assistant professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, looked into this question in 2018 while predicting how a flu pandemic would spread in the UK, for the documentary Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic.“We were looking for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and pooling the results from these studies,” she says. One review, published in 2017, found significant effects from handwashing, compared with nonsignificant effects from face-mask use. When Klepac and colleagues drilled down into the highest quality data, gathered from a clinical setting, with clinical diagnosis and a control group (who didn’t increase hand hygiene) they discovered that if you washed your hands five to 10 times more than usual, “that would reduce your risk by a quarter”.At the start of a pandemic, this is pretty much all you’ve got. “You don’t have pharmaceutical interventions,” says Klepac. “You don’t have a vaccine. This is why we’re looking at nonpharmaceutical measures that are easily implemented.”To Wahrman, this knowledge feels empowering. “You can say to people: ‘Here’s one thing you can do to lower your risk.’ It’s simple. It’s right there and doesn’t cost anything. Wash your hands with soap before you touch your mouth, your nose or your eyes. It’s empowering because it really does make a difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a3f92d5a9e865dc7794d7eaaf914a2604a9bcc0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=102931d2755352ac8e299195a9d0c3ad","title":"new york coronavirus streets","story":"The city has taken significant steps to keep people at home – and on Tuesday the lack of buzz on its streets was apparent It was romantic, in a post-apocalyptic sort of way.A young couple, walking arm-in-arm in downtown Manhattan, huddled under their shared umbrella. Their eyes seemed bright, filled with affection – and, unlike the bottom half of their faces, unobscured by pale blue surgical masks.They were among those meandering this part of New York City despite widespread anxiety over coronavirus. While neighborhoods were not completely dead, many shops were closed and there was a marked decline in foot traffic.As coronavirus cases continue to spike in New York and across the US, iniduals, authorities, and institutions are all taking steps to contain this outbreak. New York’s court system has slowed to a crawl. Public schools here are shuttered. The city has ordered its world famous restaurants and bars theaters closed, except for takeout. Broadway shows have gone dark.In Chinatown, coronavirus-spurred quietude was most apparent with empty and shuttered eateries. Many bakeries, usually abuzz with customers buying buns and coffee, were near-empty.“Under these dire circumstances selections may be limited,” advised one bakery’s sign. It was printed on paper and affixed to the window. Other signs posted on doors advised customers of temporary and indefinite closures. Through windows, chairs were seen stacked atop tables. Salespersons in some of the neighborhood’s eyeglass and jewelry stores stood idle, waiting for customers.Slightly north, a sign in a still-open Little Italy bakery advised clients: “For Your Safety + Ours, No More Than 4 People At a Time.”Handbags and haute couture sat unsold at closed boutiques as one neared the chic Soho neighborhood, though some signs advised prospective customers that they could make shopping appointments.On Broadway, walking Downtown from Houston Street, the sidewalks were near-empty. Victoria’s Secret, normally swarmed with patrons picking over buy-three, get-three unmentionables, was locked. The Prada outlet once popularized by Sex In the City, was newly silent.Further south, near city hall, a man ambled down the sidewalk, toting a cylindrical container of sanitizing wipes. One white disinfectant sheet was sticking out.“As much as I like my dentist, I don’t trust the seat was being fully cleaned,” said the man, Mark Oldman, who had a dental appointment. “You have to bring your own.”“The hottest accessory on the streets of New York is no longer an iPhone,” he joked.Did the city seem different to him, with all the closings?“It feels like Thanksgiving,” he said of the US holiday, during which many New York City residents leave town. “Not completely dead, it just has this kind of ghost-town, tumbleweed quality.”“It’s not as apocalyptic as the TV news would suggest,” he continued. “I just saw a woman walk into Zara and I thought, ‘that’s interesting, shopping during the plague.’”There were other glimpses of cautious normalcy.Two construction workers conversed while walking towards Wall Street. One had a N-95 respirator mask on his face, and it somehow remained in place though the straps were down. His companion was not wearing a mask, and he spat on the ground as they walked.Near the Civic Center, a young woman in a surgical mask exited a college building. She sat on a bench and pulled down her mask, so it rested below her chin. Then, she lit a cigarette. She smoked , though it entails repeated hand-mouth contact.Back near Chinatown, a queue had formed outside the city marriage bureau. Because of social distancing initiatives, only 50 people were permitted inside at a time, slowing down the licensing process.Rei Hayashi and Ben Shaul, who have been together eight years, were among those waiting. The license is just “paperwork”, Hayashi and Shaul said, but they had the time to come down and decided to get it.Hayashi, who has legal permanent residency, was concerned about potential border closures.“It’s just checking off boxes,” Shaul said.Federica Bressan, a Fulbright Scholar who plans on returning to her hometown of Gorizia, Italy on Sunday. She is “heartbroken” to leave New York City and while she doesn’t fear coronavirus here per se, “It’s the uncertainty. I don’t know what’s going to happen.”“No matter what happens, I think being at home is always better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9541e60498fb0d20272dd1ae624239c1d4c19652/0_0_3837_2301/master/3837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668f2c8fe7b4f99ce6feb9ee6f0dbc8c","title":"wednesday briefing coronavirus the race home","story":"Governments warn citizens overseas to return now … Joe Biden storms more primaries … and Batman’s sidekick turns 80, but what about the women?Hello – Warren Murray, keeping you close to the news in this time of social distancing.Travellers across the world are scrambling to find flights home as the number of coronavirus cases nears 200,000 globally, prompting governments to urge citizens to return and some nations to announce the imminent closure of airports and borders. The Australian government has advised citizens to return home as soon as possible by commercial means, warning that overseas travel is becoming “more complex and difficult”. Canada, New Zealand, Indonesia and the UAE have issued similar blanket advice. In the UK, the foreign office is warning against all but essential travel to many countries. It is withdrawing some staff from its embassy in Myanmar and has told British citizens to leave the country if able to do so due to “potential pressures on medical facilities” and the risk of flights shutting down. Here is our latest at-a-glance roundup of the global situation.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced a £350bn package of loans and grants to help Britain cope with the lockdown of large parts of the economy. Every business in the retail, leisure and hospitality sector will have a year-long holiday from business rates with smaller companies eligible for a cash grant of up to £25,000. The chancellor also announced cash grants of £10,000 for the UK’s 700,000 smallest companies and a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments for home owners having difficulty because of the virus. Sunak said measures would be announced in coming days to help those renting. ’s financial editor, Nils Pratley, writes that in terms of the scale of the intervention “the UK has never seen anything like it” but to avert mass layoffs the government may need to go further and underwrite British companies’ payroll costs as some other countries are doing. Keir Starmer, one of the Labour leadership finalists, writes that as well as those renting, areas like the social care sector need more money, as do local authorities and public services, but they received none: “The extra fiscal stimulus announced by the chancellor is overdue, but we have to be honest that it is does not go far enough.”The Queen is to decamp early to Windsor Castle before Easter, while cancelling her traditional garden parties and postponing investitures. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be taking “appropriate measures” after suggestions that Prince Harry could have been exposed – in what you might call “six degrees of celebrity infection”, Harry shared a hug recently with Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton, who had been in contact with Idris Elba and Sophie Trudeau, both of whom have tested positive. In terms of everyday practicalities for the rest of us: Sainsbury’s is closing its cafes and meat, fish and pizza service counters so staff can work on providing the essentials. It says supplies are still flowing in but shoppers will be restricted to a maximum of three items of any grocery product and two packets of popular items such as toilet paper, soap and UHT milk. Tesco 24-hour supermarkets will close overnight so shelves can be restocked. The global infection rate at time of writing stands at 197,830 with 7,944 deaths worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The Mental Welfare Commission says the Scottish government must to do more to ensure they receive proper specialist care.Five-year limit on war crime cases – A five-year time limit is to be imposed on bringing prosecutions against British soldiers and veterans who have served abroad, except in “exceptional circumstances”. Legislation introduced by the government deliberately excludes British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland. An “absolute maximum of six years” time limit would also be imposed for bringing civil claims in connection with overseas operations. Future governments will also be “compelled to consider derogating from the European convention on human rights in relation to significant overseas military operations” – a proposal that has been raised before.“We disrupt ecosystems, and we shake viruses loose from their natural hosts,” David Quammen recently wrote in the New York Times. “When that happens, they need a new host. Often, we are it.” As people invade natural habitats and bioersity losses increase globally, John Vidal writes for our Age of Extinction series that the coronavirus outbreak may be just the beginning of mass pandemics.One British doctor is self-isolated with what seems to be Covid-19. In the past couple of weeks he saw maybe 70 people in outpatients. So why won’t the NHS test him for the virus? “They are abandoning the basic principles for dealing with an epidemic, which are to test whenever possible, trace contacts and contain. Almost all inidual physicians I know feel that what they are doing is wrong.”And in the US state of California, a look at what the instruction to “shelter in place” translates to in real life: long lines, empty roads and panic-buying of cannabis.

You can find it here: Indonesia’s foreign affairs ministry has announced the suspension of all short-stay visa exemptions and visas on arrival for 30 days. The measure takes effect this Friday, 20 March. The government has advised citizens to return home from abroad as soon as possible. Argentina registered its highest single-day rise in reported coronavirus cases so far Tuesday, with 14 new cases – 12 corresponding to recent arrivals from abroad – bringing the total to 79. Two deaths have been reported so far.Grappling to deal with the crisis, Argentina has gone into full lockdown, leaving thousands of Argentinians stranded abroad. The latest estimate is that there are 30,000 nationals struggling to return to the country due to the suspension of incoming flights. Authorities are negotiating special flights with international carriers and putting the national carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas into high gear.Authorities are also working to stem the sudden flow of thousands of people to Argentina’s Atlantic beach resorts. The announcement of paid work leave for persons over 60 and permission for others to work from home has apparently been taken by many as an extension of the southern hemisphere summer holidays.“We don’t want you to come, there’s an international situation and the protocols for isolation and quarantine have to be respected,” tweeted the mayor of Pinamar, a major beach resort.Highway controls and the cancellation of all long-distance flights, trains and buses will start Friday, as Argentina heads for a long weekend.A bit more on the first case in The Gambia now:In a televised statement, Health Minister Ahmadou Lamin Samateh said officials in the tiny West African state had confirmed an infection in a young woman who had recently travelled from the United Kingdom.She went into self-isolation after feeling feverish, before being confirmed as a positive case.“All passengers who came in the same flight or in contact with the confirmed case will be traced and undergo isolation,” the minister said.Samateh’s announcement came straight on the heels of a televised statement from President Adama Barrow, who announced anti-virus measures on Tuesday before The Gambia had a single confirmed case.The president announced a ban on public gatherings and the closure of schools for three weeks from Wednesday.Travellers from affected countries will also be isolated for two weeks, the president said.Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now, taking over from my colleague Kevin Rawlinson.

Random single-car breath and drug tests will continue.Victoria has taken the same approach — suspended the use of the big drug0.05 bus but continued to do single car stops.And in a statement on Wednesday, Victoria Police said drivers could not refuse a breath test out of coronavirus fears.Here’s a summary of the latest news:You can read a summary of the day’s earlier events here.In a report, ratings agency S\u0026ampP said that “the 2020 global recession is here and now”, slashing growth forecasts for economies around the world.Before the exchange opened, more companies revealed the damage they were taking from the virus outbreak.Air New Zealand shares have been suspended until at least Friday while the company works out the hit it will take from sweeping Kiwi travel bans.The Australian government gave that country’s airlines a package of tax and service charge cuts worth $715m this morning amid widespread uncertainty about their ability to continue given travel bans and the end of corporate travel.

Elsewhere, a decision on whether horse racing fixtures continue is expected from the industry body.Since Monday GPs have been able to refer patients with symptoms, such as a cough and fever, for testing – which has created a backlog the health service is now struggling to clear. Latest figures released on Tuesday night show there are now 292 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the State, following an increase of 69 cases. In a dramatic televised address to the nation on St Patrick’s Day, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said officials predict the number of cases could rise to 15,000 by the end of the month. Mr Varadkar said in the coming weeks the elderly and more vulnerable would be told to stay indoors in a practice called “cocooning”, where they would be supplied with essentials. The unprecedented measures will attempt to slow the spread of the virus would likely last for months, he said. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr Donohoe will meet the chief executives of the country’s banks to discuss the fallout from the crisis – such as an expected surge in bad loans as many businesses go under and homeowners fall behind on mortgage payments.Social distancing requirements have led to the closure of the country’s 7,000 pubs and many restaurants, leaving tens of thousands facing unemployment. The board of Horse Racing Ireland will meet by phone on Wednesday to discuss what further steps the industry should take in response to the coronavirus. Both Britain and France have suspended horse racing, while race meetings have taken place behind closed doors in Ireland since Friday. On Thursday, the Dáil is set to consider emergency legislation to give the Government sweeping powers to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The measures would include powers to direct people to stay in their homes and detain those believed to have the virus who refuse to self isolate. It would also allow for events or gatherings that pose a clear risk to public health to be prohibited.The legislation will also provide for enhanced income supports for people who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or required to self-isolate.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205384.1584479283!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"derry school with suspected case of covid 19 not allowed to close","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Peter Weir said previously that the time was not yet right to close schools. Photograph: Colm Lenaghan Pacemaker A primary school in Northern Ireland with a suspected case of coronavirus in one of its pupils has been denied permission to close by the North’s Department of Education, the school’s principal has said. The pupil at Ebrington Primary and Nursery School in Derry displayed no symptoms at school last week but became unwell over the weekend. The student has not been tested as tests are carried out in the North only when a patient is hospitalised.In a letter to parents which was published on the school’s website, Brian Guthrie said he had applied to the department for two exceptional closure days on Thursday and Friday. “I have been unsuccessful and these have been denied,” he wrote. This, he said, was “a similar story to many other primary schools in our city who had applied for the same”. Thorough cleaning of the school will take place on Wednesday, and the school will be open from Thursday.“I totally understand and respect your decision to protect your children and families,” Mr Guthrie wrote. “You should, therefore, do what you feel is right for your own inidual circumstances.” The  approached the Department of Education for comment on Tuesday night. The Minister for Education, the DUP MLA Peter Weir, previously said the time was not yet right to close schools. When that decision is made, he has said, it will be on the basis of medical and scientific advice. An increasing number of schools in the North have decided to close until the end of the week to allow staff time to prepare for any future school closures. In an open letter to the Minister of Education, the Catholic Principals’ Association called for schools to close and said parents had “already started making your decisions for you by keeping children at home”.The First Minister and Deputy First Minister will on Wednesday chair a meeting of the Civil Contingencies Group (NI) to lead the response of the public sector to the coronavirus outbreak.Ten new cases of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, were diagnosed in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cases to 62.Job lossesBusinesses in the North on Tuesday called for clarity and for financial support to prevent widespread job losses. The chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill, called for clear instructions as to whether businesses in the hospitality industry in Northern Ireland should close, and for support for the up to 65,000 workers affected. “I have had grown men in tears,” he told BBC Radio Foyle, “telling me they have no choice, that their businesses will go to the wall.” Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and Belfast’s Lyric Theatre – which remained open throughout the Troubles – have announced that they would close to attempt to halt the spread of the virus. Businesses in the North will not pay rates for the next three months, after the Minister of Finance, the Sinn Féin MLA Conor Murphy, announced £100 million of emergency funding last night. The North can also expect to benefit from the £330 billion of emergency funding announced by the UK chancellor on Tuesday.

Photograph:  Nick Bradshaw The Government will have the power to restrict travel between geographical areas, prohibit certain events and detain people suspected of having coronavirus under far-reaching new legislation agreed by the Cabinet.The legislation, which was published on Tuesday night, contains a series of regulations designed to prevent, limit and slow the spread of Covid-19, including a spread outside the State. Under the new measures, the Government will also have the power to direct citizens to stay at home.The Health Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2020 will allow the Government to legally impose restrictions on travel to and from the State and also to impose restrictions to and from geographical locations.The proposed law also provides for certain extra powers, should they be needed if extreme situations were to arise, in relation to gatherings and events where there would be an immediate, exceptional and manifest risk to human life and public health from the spread of the coronavirus.The Government will have the power to require a person to remain in their home and to prohibit events which could pose a risk of infection. Events in certain geographical locations can also be prohibited.The legislation also provides for the detention of a person believed to be probable source of infection.Where a medical officer believes that such a person is a potential risk to public health and refuses to remain in their home, the officer can in writing order their detention and isolation in a hospital or other place .Separately, the legislation also provides for enhanced income supports for people who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or required to self-isolate.Changes will also be made to remove the waiting period for payment of Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance in these circumstances.The Government said that these changes will involve “a significant Exchequer cost but are necessary to support the public health objective of ensuring people who need to self-isolate do so”.Exceptional circumstances“These are provisions which the Government hopes it won’t have to use, given the powers already in place under the Health Act 1947, but legislation is being introduced to give Government powers in exceptional circumstances in the unlikely event that the need arises,” a Government statement said.The measures in the Bill relate only to the exceptional circumstances facing the country due to Covid-19.Speaking on Tuesday, Minister for Health Simon Harris said it is highly unlikely that the more drastic measures, such as detaining a personal suspecting of coronavirus, will need to be used. He said it was “important just to have that permission because we don’t know where this pandemic is going to bring us in the coming days and weeks” .Opposition parties will examine the legislation on Wednesday and some may seek to make amendments. It will then go before the Dáil on Thursday where a reduced number of TDs will attend in order to comply with social distancing.

Photograph: Tom Honan Is it just me or is it very hot in here? Might just take a little lie down. Perhaps it was unwise to discontinue self-isolating after visiting the White House last week. What with President Trump being in contact with more carriers than the back wheel of a push-bike. And the rest of us packed like sardines around the twin sofas in the Oval Office. “Will you take a wee drop of sanitiser in your hand?” No chance of hearing that in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Glad to be home.Oh Jesus, the heat. Might take that little lie down now...Still, it was worth going out to cover this year’s St Patrick’s Day Parade. Bashed out a colour piece for the paper and all. Remotely, of course.Conditions may have been blustery but the weather held up for the photos and that’s the main thing. There is nothing worse than when it rains on our national holiday. O’Connell Street was en fete, with drunken youths pouring merrily from buses well before the midday start. There was a festive atmosphere around town, the partying locals joined by over 200,000 half-cut overseas visitors dressed in leprechaun suits and shamrock festooned onsies.As the parade assembled near Parnell Square, the VIP stand opposite the GPO began to fill up with minor politicians and their offsprings’ offspring. Minister for the Arts Josepha Madigan arrived bang on time – an hour after a press release was issued alerting the media to her expected presence and many fine achievements in office. She was wearing an elegant woollen coat in a loud shade of Mary-Lou green. Eamon Ryan took his place on the viewing platform. As leader of the Green Party he is official ruler of Ireland for the day. He sported a necklace of wolverine teeth donated to the city in 2009 by actor Hugh Jackman. Unfortunately, Eamon refused to talk to any other leaders because they won’t form a national government with him. He self-isolated opposite Clery’s clock with his large entourage and their policy papers High spiritsNever mind. The crowd was in high spirits. They cheered and wept for joy when the lord mayor’s gilded coach arrived carrying the capital city’s first citizen Jim Gavin. Tom who? Tom Brabazon, Fianna Fáil? Oh right. He was the lad wearing the gold chain. Jim Gavin, the legend who led Dublin’s footballers to a record five-in-a-row All-Irelands was interviewed on the street by RTÉ’s Bláthnaid Ní Chofaigh. You could see the Nationwide presenter was glad to be away from the poisonous atmosphere in the commentary box where unruly scenes unfolded earlier between all the sports commentators looking for a gig after their matches and race meetings were cancelled. They should have turned off the microphones. Some of the kiddies started crying when a torrent of ‘effin ’n blindin’ between parade regular Des Cahill and horse pundit Ted Walsh burst from the public address system. And then George Hamilton and Tony O’Donoghue started sobbing, and that set more of them off. Thankfully the arrival of Uachtarán na hÉireann and his wife enlivened proceedings even more. Michael D and Sabina were interviewed by Bláthnaid when Gavin finally stopped talking. The President said mystical things in Irish and English, and the Americans swooned and wished they could like him along with Donald Trump. Brass bands You could hear the brass bands beckoning from the Garden of Remembrance. The wonderful Dublin Fire Pipe Brigade band was already on the scene, this year with two very special mascots – Bród and Síoda, Ireland’s First Dogs. For some this was the highlight of the parade. At the barrier a mammy was telling her small daughter all about them. “But Ma, I thought them dogs was Áras an Uachtaráin dogs. Where’s Bernie’s Mountain?”“I don’t know, love. But that’s what they are: Bernie’s Mountain Dogs. She’s probably from Kerry.”The theme of this year’s festival parade was “Spring Fever”.It was a big day for the grand marshall, who eschewed the usual mode of conveyance – a flash car. He may not be a minister when the next government is formed, so it was good practice. Instead Simon Harris arrived at the reviewing stand on a hospital trolley, pushed by exhausted nurses and doctors. He then walked the 2.5km route wearing a green velvet Uncle Sam-style tailcoat, knee breeches, brogues and a green top hat with a Tricolour band.Instead of a silver-topped cane Uncle Si carried a giant cotton swab, cutting quite the dash.The broad silk sash across his chest was embroidered in gold with the words “Your Country Needs You!”An appreciative local crowd applauded because even though he is the Minister for Health in a Government just given the bum’s rush in a general election, he is playing a blinder as front-of-house manager in this current crisis. Magnificent floatsIt took nearly two hours for the magnificent floats to pass the halfway point in a riot of colour and clamour. Weird and wonderful creations filled the streets, though everyone missed the great Paddy Drac, who died last year. The FAI float was a shambles, covered in cheap green and white crepe paper and mouldy scraps of decent-skin blazers. Eamon Dunphy sat at the back, throwing pens into the crowd. For years the FAI float featured a giant inflatable “Delaney Baby” but it burst. It cost a fortune but delivered nothing. It was followed by the “DemaboveinDublin” float sponsored by Michael Healy-Rae’s Black Cap Company Ltd (trading as his Mace Shop in Kilgarvan). It featured members of the Rural Independents Group dancing on a giant inflatable Shane Ross. There was confusion over the meaning of one pageant called “Stifle Sighs” with its giant inflatable gammon, dancing horses’ heads, theatrically expiring grannies and tipsy children dressed as the Cotswolds. The theatre company, from Cheltenham, explained the title is an anagram of “Selfish Gits”. The Brexit float had to be seen to be believed. Apparently it had a giant inflatable Baby Boris. But nobody saw it. Among all the talented groups from home and abroad, the Formation Talk Dancers from Kildare Street really caught the eye. They pirouetted around giant inflatable “self-oscillating taoisigh”, with full permission from the HSE.The crowd was enchanted. One man became emotional when a giant inflatable toilet roll surrounded by dancing Prof McConkeys sashayed past his spot outside Supermacs. He told us his name. “Joe. Joe Deviris. ” He was loving the parade. “As I told your researcher, in regards of Prof McConkey….” A colleague from the Examiner smirked and waved his notebook at us. The McDonald Majorettes kept trying to overtake the groups in front of them, twirling their Big Mandate Batons. “We should be up the front,” said a chap dressed as a house, muscling past. He said his name was Eoin. “Too right,” said a chap dressed as a fiscal space, pushing on through. He said his name was Pearse. “If the batons don’t work we’ll be blowing our trumpets outside Government Buildings to get back into the limelight,” said Mary Lou, chief twirler. Soothing wordsA very fancy schmancy float purred past, dripping soothing words, a giant inflated John Concannon held down by ropes smiling above it. He’s the Government’s favourite Sultan of Spin. Back again. Meanwhile, the Taoiseach said a few words from the reviewing stand before he left, standing at a safe distance from the hacks because he is self-oscillating and it feels good. “Ireland is open for business,” declared Leo Varadkar, reading from an old St Patrick’s Day script. He hastily changed course. It’s not. We’re closed. He went on television at 9pm to talk to the country about it. Not a state of the nation but a “the state of the nation” address. He’s doing a good job handling this crisis. It was definitely one of the best St Patrick’s Day parades we’ve seen. Who could forget the giant inflatable candidates for the Seanad, high on their pomp? Or those happy US politicians crowded onto the annual Seamus Heaney Quote Float, where hope and history incessantly rhymes and waits to catch the heart off guard and blow it open….”Is it me or is it still very hot in here?Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205195.1584461441!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia testing nato by breaching irish airspace ex us general","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the Russian Tupolev TU-95 Bear bombers that entered international airspace controlled by the Irish Aviation Authority off Ireland’s west coast.  Russia is flying bombers into Irish-controlled airspace to test response times by the RAF and other Nato airforces and to “map” radar coverage, according to a former US army commander in Europe.Retired commander Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, who was the commanding general of the US Army in Europe from 2014 to 2017, said that the Kremlin may be trying to pick at “a seam” that has developed between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in the wake of Brexit.Last week two Russian Tupolev TU-95 Bear bombers entered international airspace controlled by the Irish Aviation Authority off Ireland’s west coast on two occasions. The incursions prompted the United Kingdom to scramble British RAF Typhoon fighter jets to intercept.It was reported last Friday that, on a third flight mission in six days, two Russian Tupolev TU-160 White Swan strategic bombers flew around the northern coast of Scotland and south along the west coast of Ireland before turning for home in the Bay of Biscay.Three RAF Typhoon fighters were dispatched from the RAF base at Lossiemouth in Scotland to track them.Retired Lieut Gen Hodges said he believes the flights are part of Russia’s interest in “mapping out the contours” of radar coverage around the so-called Greenland-Iceland-UK gap, a significant geopolitical and strategic area in international airspace and waters.Ireland’s status as a non-Nato country could be seen by Russia as “a seam that could be exploited”, he said.“There is no doubt in my mind that they are doing reconnaissance there. The submarine activity out there is just as much of a concern and for the same reasons,” said Lieut Gen Hodges.The retired three-star general, who commanded combat forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, oversaw the expansion of US military co-operation with Ukraine after 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and supported armed rebels in eastern Ukraine.“They are testing response times and techniques. They do this all around the Black Sea as well as up in the Atlantic and in the Baltic region,” the retired general told The .He added that he expects the Russians to “continue testing to see how we respond, to continue to do reconnaissance, to map out the contours of what the radar coverage is and what can we do. This all goes into their big data effort to use for a rainy day.”The former officer in command put the expansion of the Russian embassy in Rathgar, south Dublin, down to the Kremlin’s same strategic interest.“The growth of the Russian embassy in Dublin is not a coincidence. Russia is paying more and more attention to Ireland because of the change in dynamics because of Brexit,” he said.Were the transponders activated?Overall, he sees this as part of Russia’s strategy to exploit areas that undermine the cohesion of institutions such as the European Union and Nato.“All of these institutions and these seams become important because they become weaker for exploitation,” he said.The Department of Transport has said that other commercial and private flights over the Atlantic had to be warned about last week’s flights as the Russian military aircraft were “unscheduled” and flying without making contact with air traffic controllers.Lieut Gen Hodges said the Irish Government “should be raising hell” about the Russian flights “in every available venue”, including the United Nations. And he added that the Taoiseach or Minister for Foreign Affairs should be calling the Russian ambassador in to meet them over the incidents.“They are doing this without their transponders turned on which is incredibly dangerous and reckless,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201478.1584038176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit next week s london talks called off due to coronavirus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier, Brexit chief negotiator for the European Union.

Photograph: Stephanie LecocqEPABrexit talks scheduled this week between European Union and United Kingdom negotiators will not go ahead to to the Covid-19 pandemic, a UK government spokesman said on Tuesday.“In light of the latest guidance on coronavirus, we will not formally be convening negotiating work strands tomorrow in the same way we did in the previous round,” the spokesman said.Both sides are examining the possibility of negotiating via video-conferencing or conference calls “in the coming weeks”, the spokesman added.Britain has until July to request an extension to its current transition period, under which it is continuing to observe pre-Brexit norms pending the agreement of a deal for future trade.If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by the end of the year, the UK will automatically begin trading with the EU on World Trade Organization terms from January 1st, 2021, a shift that is forecast to damage the Irish economy, particularly exports. Britain left the EU in January.The two sides had been scheduled to hold rotating rounds of talks between London and Brussels until May. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the European Commissions said the possibility of extending the transition period was a question for the UK, and that remote alternatives to the talks like video-conferencing were being explored.‘Very dynamic environment’“We definitely will do our best to ensure we have the capacity to do so,” the spokesman said. “Obviously we are in a very dynamic environment.”Meanwhile, EU leaders are set to hold their second summit in two weeks in a fresh attempt to forge a joint response to the coronavirus pandemic as Europe takes over from China as the frontline in the fight against the disease. They will meet in a virtual online video-conference from their offices in the bloc’s 27 capitals.The virus case count in Europe has climbed to more than 50,000 and more than 2,000 people have died of it in the region. The inexorable spread of the disease has hit markets and sown public fear, but nervous governments have introduced quick-fix measures – partial border closures or quarantine – with little consultation.After Italy, ground zero in Europe’s battle with Covid-19, Spain and now France have imposed lockdowns, confining citizens to their homes except for urgent business such as buying food or heading to any hospital that might still have the capacity to treat them.ID checksSeven countries have informed the European Commission, the EU’s executive body, that they have reintroduced ID checks inside Europe’s passport-free Schengen Area. Among them are Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, which all took unilateral action to halt the influx of migrants in 2015.Indeed, it is a similar challenge that leaders are grappling with as they confront the coronavirus – how to ensure that the fraying solidarity among partners in the same European club does not completely unravel as the crisis deepens.Asked on Monday whether Europe can ever return to real ID-check free travel after this, German chancellor Angela Merkel said: “I hope so. But it’s been shown that co-ordination didn’t work well everywhere the way one would have hoped.”The main problem confronting the leaders is to halt the arrival of more virus cases, co-ordinate any border closures and guarantee that vital medical equipment and food can reach those in need.They are expected to endorse a 30-day travel ban on people wanting to come to Europe for tourism or non-essential business. Long-term EU residents, diplomats and members of European families would be exempt. Health care and transport workers could escape the ban too.Separately, so-called “green lanes” would be set up at the internal borders of the Schengen countries, allowing fast-track access for trucks ferrying essential supplies to defy the traffic jams that have begun forming at some crossing points.Single marketThe aim, according to European Council president Charles Michel, who will chair the summit, is “to reduce unnecessary movement but at the same time to ensure the movement of merchandise, of goods, so that we can guarantee as much as possible the integrity of the single market, guarantee the deliveries that are needed”.The proposals are relatively modest, but Europe’s powers in this crisis are limited. While it may be a union, the world’s biggest trading bloc remains an accumulation of 27 inidual countries, some with populist and far-right governments that reject orders from Brussels.“In recent days, European countries failed to co-ordinate their approach,” Czech prime minister Andrej Babis said on Saturday as he announced the closure of retail businesses in his country. “We didn’t need to wait for Brussels to give us any advice.” – additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4205655.1584512783!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"joe biden cements lead with further wins in us primaries","story":"Former US vice-president Joe Biden has further cemented his lead in the Democratic presidential nominee race with three more primary wins.

Photograph:  Getty ImagesPresidential candidate Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, cementing his path to the Democratic nomination as the party chooses its candidate to take on Donald Trump in November’s presidential election.Mr Biden won the Florida primary by a huge margin, scooping up the majority of the 219 delegates at stake in the state.He was also projected to win in the rust-best state of Illinois as well as further west in Arizona.Exit polls suggested that the former vice president won a high percentage of the African-American vote in Florida, as expected. But he also polled extremely well with white blue collar workers who bolstered his rival Bernie Sanders in the 2016 election.Three states — Florida, Arizona and Illinois — held their primary contests as planned yesterday, despite the threat of coronavirus. But Ohio postponed its primary until June, generating tensions between the state’s governor and the courts over the decision. As well as the two front-runners, Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was also on the ballot in the three states.DelayedSeveral primaries that had been scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, including in Louisiana and Georgia, have all delayed their selection processes by several weeks. The party’s nominee will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in July in Wisconsin, though the deepening coronavirus crisis has thrown the trajectory of the primary cycle into question.Mr Biden’s strong performance on Tuesday follows his victory in five of the six states that voted a week ago, as well as the vast majority of states on Super Tuesday on March 3rd.He has now established what appears to be an insurmountable lead over his main rival, Bernie Sanders, who failed to capitalise on his wins in the early voting states in February, particularly after a swathe of former presidential candidates endorsed Mr Biden. While Mr Sanders lost all three states to Hillary Clinton in 2016, his margin of defeat against Biden was greater on Tuesday.As votes continued to be counted, the former vice president had at least 1,121 delegates, compared to Mr Sanders’s 839 last night. The nominee needs to reach a threshold of 1,991 to become the party’s candidate.Addressing supporters last night from Wilmington, Delaware, via a livestream feed and wearing a green tie to mark St Patrick’s Day, much of Mr Biden’s speech focused on coronavirus.“Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency, akin to fighting a war,” he said. “This is a moment when we need our leaders to lead.”“The coronavirus does not care if you are a Democrat or a Republican,” he said, it will “touch people in positions of power as well as the most vulnerable in society. We’re all in this together”.He also attempted to reach out to younger voters who have tended to back Mr Sanders in the Democratic primaries so far. “I hear you, I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and unify this nation.”PandemicDespite the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, which has started to impact daily life in America, turnout in Florida appeared to be higher than in 2016, though this may have reflected the large number of postal and early voting. The total number of people who voted in Illinois was much lower than in 2016, reflecting the fact that fewer voters voted early.The latest primaries come less than four months before the Democratic National Convention in July.In the last debate before Tuesday’s primary contests, both Mr Biden and Mr Sanders said they would support the other, whoever becomes the party’s candidate.Mr Biden also pledged to choose a woman as his running-mate if he is selected as the party’s nominee, and reiterated his pledge to appoint the first black woman to the Supreme Court, saying it was “long overdue”.Mr Biden’s public commitment prompted immediate speculation as to who his choice would be. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar – who both ran for the party’s nomination but have since endorsed Mr Biden – and Georgia’s former governor Stacey Abrams were among the names that have been mentioned. Michigan’s governor Gretchen Whitmer, a high-profile endorser of Mr Biden, whose support may have helped him to his decisive victory in the state’s primary last Tuesday ruled herself out in an interview with MSNBC. “It’s not going to be me,” she said.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Supermarkets begin rationing and call for help amid fears of riotingWhere in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?UK coronavirus lockdown plans: What the Government advice means for youComment: Most people will recover from coronavirus, but will the hospitality industry?Who is winning the battle for delegates in the US Election 2020 Democratic primary race?From Tom Hanks to Mikel Arteta, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: UK travel ban - ask our expertsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a daySupermarkets call for police protection amid fears of riotingWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?What the Government\u0026#39s new coronavirus advice means for how we live nowWhere in London have coronavirus cases been detected?Sex offenders could face compulsory lie detector tests after study reveals success in exposing incriminating evidenceWhy TV is your cultural saviour during the coronavirusComment: The Continent\u0026#39s response to coronavirus proves that European \u0026#39solidarity\u0026#39 has always been a shamTaiwan closes its borders to foreign visitors to keep coronavirus outSouth Korean ballet star fired after ignoring coronavirus quarantine to take holidayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/17/TELEMMGLPICT000227951577_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8juO8C_Vdx2cT20LARTibjWU-KwRaHvlaJXY1texVLQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"not age matters healthy","story":"\u0026#39Policies that increase social exclusion of the elderly must be avoided at all costs\u0026#39On Sunday morning I woke up with a jolt. The plan had shifted to cocoon over-70s in their homes for four months. At the same time, special powers would be introduced to allow the arrest of those who broke the quarantine rules. I imagined police cars chasing little old ladies with their shopping trolleys down the high street and helicopters zooming in on me walking my dog. Had the world gone crazy?I declare a conflict here – I am 71. I also work full-time and am reasonably fit. The thought of being locked up fills me with absolute horror. Until now our Government’s response on coronavirus has been laudable and I’ve been very supportive. Not the hysteria we’ve seen in the US and some other countries but measured, scientifically based and sensible. This new bombshell was simply not thought through at all.The rationale is straightforward. The death rate from Covid-19 is higher in infected older people. That’s clear from China, Korea and Italy. On their way to heaven they use up NHS resources: ventilators, ITU beds and nursing time, all in short supply. Locking people up for their own protection seems a logical policy to save resources. But it’s not age that really matters – it’s the state of health prior to infection. Many 50-year-olds are burdened with serious comorbidities – diabetes, chronic lung disease, heart failure. Lifestyle issues – obesity, lack of exercise, smoking and alcohol abuse also threaten longevity.I’ve been a consultant oncologist in the NHS for 40 years. When I started, we had all sorts of age cut-offs, rigidly implemented. Renal dialysis stopped at 50, bone marrow transplants at 55, and even admission to coronary care units at 65. Patients over that age who had a heart attack were carted off to a very depressing Victorian geriatric hospital – fortunately now closed. There were no monitors, drugs or devices to normalise abnormal heart rhythms, and certainly no crash trolleys. Gradually, we came to realise it was not the absolute biological age that mattered but health and lifestyle status. The ageist policies were all discarded 20 years ago.This pandemic is no different. There are many factors that make an inidual more prone to serious illness with this virus. We need to select iniduals who should protect themselves as best as possible based on their general health, not age.Most healthy septuagenarians are fine to stay in society. And sequestering people will have profound psychological problems for many. My wife runs a lunch club once a month for 40 people at a local restaurant. At Christmas I provide wine and they get a little tipsy. It’s great to see them enjoying themselves. But today’s lunch is cancelled, leaving a new void in their already empty lives. OK, social gatherings are probably not on, but shutting older people away is not the answer. One minister suggested that taking the dog for a walk would be fine. If anyone wants to borrow my dog he’s always available. What kind of policymaking is this?There will be deaths and that is sad. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) predicted in January that there will be 620,000 deaths in the UK this year. The worst-case scenario for coronavirus-related deaths is 250,000. But this is double-counting – the majority of virus deaths are already in the ONS total. Many will die whether infected or not. But loneliness is a killer, too. Statistics clearly show the mortality rate is higher after the death of a partner. The psychological morbidity of isolation is profound. Lack of communication, boredom and social isolation can lead to deep depression, making people question the value of their lives. Such existential thoughts can lead to serious physiological problems, compounded by claustrophobia and suicidal ideation. There is only so much daytime TV and so many boxsets the mind can take without going mad.Fortunately, it seems that my isolation is no longer compulsory. I will change my work pattern a bit. I’ve planned Skype consultations instead of a clinic tomorrow. Life will change but it will go on. But policies that increase social exclusion of the elderly must be avoided at all costs.Coronavirus latest news: Supermarkets begin rationing and call for help amid fears of riotingWhere in the UK have cases of coronavirus been detected - and how many are there?UK coronavirus lockdown plans: What the Government advice means for youComment: Most people will recover from coronavirus, but will the hospitality industry?Who is winning the battle for delegates in the US Election 2020 Democratic primary race?From Tom Hanks to Mikel Arteta, coronavirus hits celebrities, sports stars and politiciansCoronavirus Q\u0026ampA: UK travel ban - ask our expertsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a daySupermarkets call for police protection amid fears of riotingWhat is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?What the Government\u0026#39s new coronavirus advice means for how we live nowWhere in London have coronavirus cases been detected?Sex offenders could face compulsory lie detector tests after study reveals success in exposing incriminating evidenceComment: The Continent\u0026#39s response to coronavirus proves that European \u0026#39solidarity\u0026#39 has always been a shamWhy TV is your cultural saviour during the coronavirusTaiwan closes its borders to foreign visitors to keep coronavirus outSouth Korean ballet star fired after ignoring coronavirus quarantine to take holidayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"continents response coronavirus proves european solidarity has","story":"True to form, the European Union’s unconvincing response to the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated that, when it comes to dealing with a crisis of truly global proportions, Brussels is little more than a liability, especially when it comes to protecting the interests of its member states.As the first country to feel the full force of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, Italy had every right to expect its EU partners to do everything in their power to ease the crisis. It was to this end that Rome made the relatively modest request for other member states to provide it with vital medical supplies, from face masks to breathing equipment. But instead of coming to Italy’s aid, the response from other EU countries was to do nothing, leaving it to China to provide the much-needed equipment.Moreover, far from inspiring a desperately-needed show of EU solidarity, the coronavirus has resulted in the vast majority of EU states seeking to protect their own interests, with Germany at one point even refusing to allow the export of face masks to Italy.Consequently, while the EU has prevaricated over how best to respond to the crisis, Europe has been brought to a virtual standstill as a succession of member states have implemented their own unilateral measures, such as closing their borders, as they seek to protect their citizens from suffering a similar fate to those of Italy.By the time European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Monday that the EU was imposing its own 30-day ban on travel to the European Union and Schengen zone, it was already a fait accompli so far as most of Europe was concerned. The vast majority of EU states had already closed their borders, rather than waiting for the cumbersome Brussels bureaucracy to ride to their rescue.It might even be argued that the EU’s tardy response is one of the reasons why Europe, not Asia, has now become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.Spread of coronavirus in EuropeAnother lamentable consequence of the EU’s inability to provide effective leadership in a crisis is that it has led to member states indulging in blatant breaches of some of the EU’s guiding principles. The decision by France and Germany, for instance, to restrict the export of medical supplies to their European neighbours is a clear violation of the European single market, while the ban imposed by Austria and the Czech Republic on all travellers from Italy breaches the principle of free movement.The EU’s inability to devise an effective response to the coronavirus outbreak is not the first time Brussels has been found wanting in terms of safeguarding the interests of its members.The bailout package the EU forced on Greece in 2010 during the eurozone crisis has consigned the country to decades of austerity, an arrangement that Yanis Varoufakis, the former Greek finance minister, recently likened to the country being placed in a debtors’ prison.It has been a similar story with the migrant crisis in southern Europe, where the EU struggled to find an effective response to the estimated 1.7 million refugees seeking shelter and refuge. About the only meaningful contribution from Brussels was to offer the Turks a six billion euro bribe to prevent the migrants from leaving Turkey. As for those that managed to make the treacherous Mediterranean crossing, they have been abandoned in makeshift camps on Greek islands such as Lesbos, where their presence, together with the legions of aid workers looking after them, has exacerbated tensions with the local inhabitants to the extent that the migrant camps are being subjected to regular attacks by vigilante groups.The EU’s sclerotic response to the coronavirus threat, together with its failure to tackle challenges ranging from Greece’ bailout to the migrant crisis, certainly raises some awkward questions about the EU’s viability in its current form.Following Brexit, the instinct of committed Europhiles such as President Emmanuel Macron of France has been to call for even closer political and economic union, with the ultimate aim of creating a European superstate.Yet the prospects of this happening appear remote indeed if, when confronted with an existential challenge like coronavirus, the default position of EU member states is to jealously protect their interests at the expense of their European neighbours, destroying key pillars of the European project, such as the free movement of people and unrestricted trade, in the process.Such behaviour not only exposes the concept of European solidarity as a complete sham it suggests that the EU will struggle to present a united front when it comes to dealing with future challenges, such its post-Brexit trading relationship with the UK.To date, EU negotiators have assumed they can play hardball with Britain because they rely on the backing of the other 27 member states. But this pretence of unity can no longer be taken for granted after the deep isions the coronavirus crisis has exposed in the EU’s ranks.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It showed the coronavirus would return and overwhelm health services every time restrictions are lifted.China and South Korea are two countries where severe measures on normal life have been taken to restrict the spread of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Imperial College experts, whose work triggered the dramatic shift in UK government tactics, said the next few weeks in China will be crucial in seeing whether the virus will bounce back.Professor Azra Ghani, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, said: “We will be learning from other countries. We’re not the only country to be facing this, every country in the world is facing exactly the same challenges. We’re monitoring now very closely the situation in China.“They are pursuing exactly this strategy, they have reduced transmission to very low levels, certainly below our thresholds, and now they are starting to open up their society again and we will see what happens in the coming weeks.”In Parliament on Tuesday the UK\u0027s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned a vaccine was the only answer. He told MPs: I don’t know how long these measures are going to be needed for. It is certainly not a couple of weeks. It is going to be months.\u0026nbspWhat happens when you release the measures is one of the big unknowns.All of the evidence from previous epidemics would suggest you can’t avoid this bubbling back up again when you lift off.”According to the Imperial College study the only chance for the UK to avoid the predicted 510,000 deaths that would be caused without any action was for the country to impose restrictions on people’s movement and social contacts.The report released on Monday showed that even with some measures of isolation and quarantining of patients, without mass restrictions on society as a whole, there were\u0026nbspstill likely to be 260,000 deaths and eight times the demand for intensive care beds, which would overwhelm the NHS.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As many as 1\u0026nbspmillion people may lose their jobs because of the fall in revenue from people not going out and spending their money.So realistically no government can keep such measures in place forever and this is where the Imperial College report becomes even more worrying.It shows that where social distancing measures are put in place and then relaxed the virus re-emerges.The report said: “The major challenge of suppression is that this type of intensive intervention package, or something equivalently effective at reducing transmission, will need to be maintained until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) given we predict that transmission will quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed.”Looking at the detail the scientists show that if restrictions are in place for five months from April to September the virus will emerge again in October and peak again in November or December – a period of time when seasonal flu and cold weather typically causes a “winter crisis”\u0026nbspin the health service.“The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity,” the report warns.This poses a real challenge to the government should no vaccine emerge in time for this second surge.The scientists offer one alternative option for ministers which is to activate and deactivate the restrictions to try and limit the virus’s impact.\u0026nbspUsing a simulation where restrictions are triggered once hospitals report 200 intensive care patients a week, the scientists showed the UK could be trapped in a coronavirus cycle that could continue for two years to November 2021.The only\u0026nbspreal salvation will be the development of a vaccine but while a number of drug companies are testing candidate vaccines there is no guarantee at this stage such a vaccine will work.This is why China and South Korea are so important and are being watched so closely. If the number of infections start to rise in both countries once restrictions are lifted that suggests the modelling predictions are right and the UK should expect a second surge as soon as normal life resumes.The report said: “While experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term.“Results in this paper have informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in the last weeks. However, we emphasise that it is not at all certain that suppression will succeed long term no public health intervention with such disruptive effects on society has been previously attempted for such a long duration of time. How populations and societies will respond remains unclear.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But experts are warning that it could also reshape politics by hardening authoritarian systems and eroding democracy in some countries, especially in fragile nations where would-be tyrants have been seeking to consolidate their power.\u0026nbspOn Monday, a group of United Nations-affiliated\u0026nbspexperts issued a stark warning that emergency measures over coronavirus should not be used by governments for political ends.\u0026nbsp“While we recognise the severity of the current health crisis and acknowledge that the use of emergency powers is allowed by international law in response to significant threats, we urgently remind states that any emergency responses to the coronavirus must be proportionate, necessary and non-discriminatory,” said the experts, who include nearly a dozen UN special rapporteurs on protections of human rights and democratic freedoms.“Emergency declarations based on the Covid-19 outbreak should not be used as a basis to target particular groups, minorities, or iniduals,” said the statement. “It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health nor should it be used to silence the work of human rights defenders.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Months-long anti-government protests in Iraq, Algeria, and Lebanon that have been a severe thorn in the side of the elites.In Turkey, the conservative Islamist-rooted government has ordered bars, nightclubs and libraries to close over coronavirus fears, but is allowing luxury shopping malls filled with stores and restaurants built by its development industry allies to remain open, without serving alcohol.\u0026nbspIn India, the coronavirus outbreak is being used by members of Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party to demonise peaceful mostly Muslim protesters who have staged a sit-in against controversial new citizenship laws since mid-December. On Tuesday, prominent local party figure Kapil Mishra said the protesters’ failure to disband immediately made them “like terrorists on a suicide mission” and “a direct threat to the lives of millions of Delhi citizens”.Leaders facing critical leadership challenges such as Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel and Romania’s prime minister Ludovic Orban found their political problems vanishing, at least temporarily. \u0026nbsp“It was a vote carried under extraordinary circumstances, where there was no room for opposition or debate,” Vlad Alexandrescu, a Romanian parliamentarian, said of an emergency vote on Saturday to give the embattled premier full powers.\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu, meanwhile, was spared the indignity of appearing in court on Tuesday across three corruption cases after his hearings have been postponed for two months due to coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings.\u0026nbspThe expansion os its powers ... is a dangerous precedent and a slippery slopeAlthough his chief elections rival ex-army chief Benny Gantz has been awarded the task of attempting to build the next government,\u0026nbsp Mr Netanyahu has not squandered the platform a national emergency brings.\u0026nbspHe has dominated TV screens, giving almost daily primetime addresses updating the country on new restrictions as well as reassuring his citizens. In a decision pushed through overnight on Tuesday, the cabinet sidestepped the parliament to allow Shin Bet to use technology developed to target Palestinian militants to tap the metadata of mobile phones used by suspected Coronavirus patients, and anyone “within the vicinity” of them.“Not only is it an invasion of privacy but also the executive branch bypassed the legislative branch, we will file our petition tomorrow,” said Maya Fried, a spokesman for the Association for Civil Rights, which is challenging the move in court.\u0026nbsp “The expansion of its powers to a strictly civilian issue is a dangerous precedent and a slippery slope.”Iran, Turkey and other countries have meanwhile tightened controls on the media, issuing stark warnings against and threatening to revoke accreditation of anyone questioning official numbers as spreading misinformation.\u0026nbspEgypt on Tuesday revoked the press credentials of ’s Cairo correspondent over a piece that reported research questioning the state’s numbers on coronavirus cases.The monarchy in Jordan on Tuesday ordered the closure of all print news outlets, and a curfew deploying the army to the entrance of the cities, citing coronavirus.\u0026nbspCiting coronavirus fears, Turkey has barred family visits for journalists held in prison on political or security charges, while limiting their phone calls to 10 minutes per week.\u0026nbsp“What you’re seeing is autocratic regimes that are using traditional autocratic methods because that’s what they’ve always used and autocracy is what brought them to their failures,” says Rami Khouri, a scholar at the American University of Beirut. “They falsify numbers of corona cases just as they falsify election returns, saying everything is fine and the few cases we have are all foreigners.”To be sure, some of the panic and reaction over coronavirus is well founded. The coronavirus pandemic is a unique crisis, and there is understandable confusion over how governments ought to respond. Public health experts have praised the efforts of some authoritarian systems such as Singapore in responding to the crisis.\u0026nbspThe monarchy in Morocco, a developing country especially vulnerable to coronavirus because of its strong ties to pandemic-stricken France and Spain, has reacted forcefully to the crisis, with a population submitting to drastic measures quickly enacted to contain the virus. “People are generally obedient and respectful of the monarchy,” says Nassim Assef, a public health specialist in Rabat.\u0026nbsp“Autocratic governments have the advantage to respond appropriately because they don’t have to deal with checks and balances,” says Erica Frantz, a professor of political science at Michigan State University and the author of the 2018 book, Authoritarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know.But autocratic leaders often don’t have the people’s best interests in mind, she says, citing Mr Trump’s initial decision to exclude the United Kingdom from a Europe-wide travel ban to reward fellow traveller Boris Johnson.\u0026nbsp“You see miracles and disasters happening more often in autocracies,” she says.\u0026nbsp “All the events in the US over coronavirus are indicative of the dangers of concentration of powers. He has hollowed out institutions, and filled them in with people who are his friends. They have very little experience and competence, and that leads to policies that are erratic and not well informed.”Just as dictators have used crises such as the 1933 burning of the German Reichstag to concentrate power throughout history, there are grave concerns that the coronavirus pandemic could be used to impose permanent measures.\u0026nbspIn the Philippines, for example, opposition lawmakers and critics have voiced fear the authoritarian right-wing government of Rodrigo Duterte will be loath to remove restrictions on the freedom of movement and assembly that appear in synch with his goals. On Tuesday he declared a “state of calamity” for six months, far longer than any other country has suspended public life.\u0026nbspPolitical scientists say that while crises sometimes bring people together and unify them for a common cause, they also present an opportunity for authoritarian leaders to impose policies they’ve long sought on otherwise reluctant people.\u0026nbsp“These crises are risky for democracies more than anything,” says Frantz. “I see these crises as opportunities for governments to crack down. We really need to pay attention to crisis events that can be used for transitions from democracy to take place.”\u0026nbspBel Trew in Beirut and Adam Withnall in Delhi contributed to this report.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It sees an ensemble of cats describing themselves through song and why they feel worthy of ascending to something called “the Heaviside Layer”.The remarkable resurrection of Showgirls, the worst movie ever madeVanessa Hudgens apologises for ‘insensitive’ coronavirus videoThe cats from Cats, ranked from least to most embarrassing“‘Let’s make 35 nonsense songs introducing cats!’ – The makers of Cats”, Rogen tweeted.

Justin Timberlake’s face on climax? Justin Timberlake’s wet jeans? Please just make it stop. If not for Cameron Diaz then for all of us. EH.517 Maps to the StarsJulianne Moore literally asks Robert Pattinson: “Do you want to f*** my holes?” And, dear reader, it turns out that he does want to. He wants to very much. So they have very stressful-looking sex in a car on the side of a the road. And then somehow it gets even worse – she disembarks from the vehicle and wipes his semen off her leg with a scarf. EH.617 Body of EvidenceOne of the most infamous sex scenes of all time is Madonna and Willem Dafoe’s experimentation with hot wax in Body of Evidence. “My way,” murmurs the Queen of Pop, straddling Dafoe and pouring molten wax and champagne over his body, before proceeding to lick it up. It’s not a Mary Berry recipe, we can tell you that much. EH.A lot of things aren’t really OK about Showgirls, but the filmmakers really outdid themselves with Elizabeth Berkley and Kyle MacLachlan’s special splish-splash in the pool. The combination of thrashing, bubbling water, fountain fondling and ecstatic yelping is the stuff of nightmares. EH.A couple of towering blue humanoids having sex doesn’t exactly scream erotica – and James Cameron’s attempts to mix it up further by having a strange dreadlock-interlocking display certainly didn’t help. EH.The Room is widely known as one of the worst films ever made – and its sex scene between Tommy Wiseau and Juliette Danielle is a big contributing factor. Why does he appear to be thrusting into her belly button? Why? EH.1017 Fifty Shades of GreyThere are lots of shades of bad in the sex scenes of this S\u0026ampM franchise. But the worst has to be when Christian ties her up, blindfolds her with his shirt and then runs down an ice cube all over her body. What misguided women’s magazine did he get this advice from? AL. This much-maligned sequel begins with Stan Collymore and Sharon Stone speeding at 100mph through Canary Wharf. The two moan and giggle as she fumbles around for his gearstick, that is until they crash the car and he dies. Not quite the happy ending he was hoping for. AL. Bradley Cooper and Michael Ian Black\u0027s sex faces are so over-exaggerated they look like emojis. It’s difficult to understand how the campers are reaching these heights of pleasure given that there’s about a foot of air between their crotches. More lukewarm American summer than hot and wet. AL.You shouldn’t have sex with your son’s fiance. But you definitely shouldn’t if you end up making it look this bad. Jeremy Irons pounces on Juliette Binoche like a hulking bear before pulling her along the carpet (think of the burns). No wonder she said she didn’t enjoy having his dangly bits touching her. AL.If these walls could talk they would say please stop having sex to Dido. They would also have something to say about the endless gooey shots of hands drifting over skin, pulling at hair and disappearing under sheets. It’s so soppy, I’m surprised Ellen DeGeneres and Sharon Stone don’t drip off the bed and onto the floor. AL.What a lot of women don’t want is a sex scene with Mel Gibson. What women want even less is to watch a scene with so many cliches: a man talking to his penis in the bathroom. A light that turns on when you clap. A woman that wails so loud you can’t tell if she’s been run over by a truck or is mid-orgasm. AL.Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” is a great song, but it’s certainly not sexy. Watchmen’s widely ridiculed sex scene sees Malin Akerman unzipping a latex chest piece to the lyrics: “Now I’ve heard there was a secret chord, that David played, and it pleased the Lord”. Unfortunately, no one will be pleased by this display. AL.This is horribly bad, but not because it’s a bad scene. More because you have to watch Rosamund Pike\u0027s crazed killer slit the throat of a guy while he’s still inside her. And then you have to watch the blood from his throat soak her red. And then you have to watch her continue to gyrate for another couple of seconds before realising necrophilia is a little too niche even for a psychopath such as herself. AL.Name a more iconic movie line than It\u0027s turkey time! Gobble, gobble” – we’ll wait. They are the bonkers words uttered by Jennifer Lopez’s Gigli character, a lesbian assassin who apparently finds herself unable to resist the masculine allure of… wait for it… Ben Affleck. It’s an invitation for oral sex and, well, you’ll have to watch the film to find out if he accepts. EH.217 Howard the Duck Cross-species coitus is, admittedly, a tricky concept to make sexy – something the traumatised viewers of Howard the Duck discovered when Lea Thompson canoodled with her “so incredibly soft and cuddly” feathered friend.

It needs to do the same on Brexit.”But Mr Raab – even as he announced advice against any foreign travel “with immediate effect” – insisted the negotiations could still succeed.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And he announced a three-month mortgage holiday for homeowners in difficulties because of the outbreak.But economic thinktank the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the chancellor – in the job for only one month – “will need to come back with more”, as firms could otherwise\u0026nbspbecome financially unviable when the loans come up for repayment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe massive cash injection – on top of a £30bn economic stimulus in last week’s budget – came as the government released emergency legislation allowing police to detain iniduals thought to be infected with the\u0026nbspvirus and enabling the government to shut down ports and airports and seize vehicles.Earlier, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned that as many as 55,000 people in the UK\u0026nbspmay now be infected and said it would be a “good outcome” if the\u0026nbspeventual death toll could be kept below 20,000.Created with Sketch.Before and after photos show impact of coronavirus around the world Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem1020 Gateway of India, Mumbai1320 Church of the Nativity, BethlehemStanding alongside Mr Johnson in the second daily coronavirus press conference at No 10, Mr Sunak said: “This is not a time for ideology\u0026nbspand orthodoxy. This is the time to be bold, a time for courage. I want to reassure every British citizen –\u0026nbspthis government will give you all the tools you need to get through this.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“We will support jobs. We will support incomes, we will support businesses, and we will help you protect your loved ones. We will do whatever it takes.\u0026nbspMr\u0026nbspSunak also said mortgage lenders had agreed a\u0026nbspscheme so that “people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage costs before they get back on their feet”.He promised to work with trade unions and business groups over the coming days to urgently develop new forms of employment support to help protect people’s jobs and their incomes.Mr Johnson acknowledged that the government’s call for Britons to stay home and avoid contact with other people was “unprecedented since World War Two”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has a plan to make sure that parents with kids who are eligible for free schools meals get the compensation or the treatment they need one way or the other. We have certainly anticipated that.”Mr Sunak said that the guaranteed loans equated to 15 per cent of UK GDP.\u0026nbsp“That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, their salaries, suppliers, or purchase stock will be able to access a government-backed loan or credit on attractive terms,” the chancellor said. “And if demand is greater than the initial £330bn I’m making available today, I will go further and provide as much capacity as required.“I said whatever it takes, and I meant it.”The support will be delivered through a new Bank of England lending facility and an extension to the business interruption scheme announced in the budget, which will now provide loans of up to £5m rather than £1.2m, interest-free for six months.He announced cash grants of up to £25,000 for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses with a rateable value below £51,000, to help them through a period when customers have been advised not to attend pubs and clubs.A year-long business rates holiday will be extended to all companies in these sectors, said the chancellor.And he assured businesses that the government’s action will allow them to make claims against insurance policies covering pandemic losses.Cash grants of £3,000 for the smallest businesses, announced in the budget, are to be increased to £10,000.Mr Sunak said he was discussing with transport secretary Grant Shapps a potential support package specifically for airlines and airports, which are suffering from a collapse in passenger numbers.IFS director Paul Johnson said that, while “substantial”, the cash support for businesses announced by the chancellor “is probably not well targeted at saving jobs”, as it will remain expensive for\u0026nbspretail, leisure and hospitality businesses to keep staff on.A package to support employment might include cuts to employer national insurance contributions, a delay in increases to the national living wage\u0026nbspand increased support for iniduals through universal credit, as well as help for workers to move temporarily to jobs now in high demand, like delivery drivers and warehouse workers, he suggested.British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said: “Businesses will welcome the scale of the government’s latest response, as well as the specific support it is offering to some of the worst-affected parts of our economy. These measures could be a lifeline for many businesses across the UK who are now experiencing wholesale disruption as a result of the pandemic.”But he warned: “Further measures will be needed to help all firms and their employees meet this unprecedented challenge.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “The government has announced a mortgage holiday for homeowners but it must suspend rents too. Millions of people rent in the UK. Suspend rents. Ban evictions. Now.”TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The chancellor is right to provide emergency support for business. But this can’t be just a bailout for boardrooms. It has to put money in workers’ pockets too.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms von der Leyen said measures would be effective only if we coordinate on the European level.The Foreign Office has already warned the public to avoid all but essential travel – though the UK has not imposed a ban or restricted incoming travellers.\u0026nbspUK advises against all foreign travel in unprecedented blow to tourismUK public told to work from home, avoid pubs and abandon travel plans But speaking on Tuesday Dominic Raab did not indicate whether the UK would take part in the ban.A UK government spokesperson also would not be drawn on whether Britain would take part in the EU scheme, telling reporters: “The UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed. We will make our own decisions on entry to the UK, notably on the basis of our scientific advice.“The Commission President has indicated that UK travellers will not be affected by these measures”.The UK has taken a softer-touch approach combatting Covid-19 than most EU member states, where lockdowns are in effect and restrictions on gatherings have been put in place.The UK spokesperson confirmed the British government had been consulted on the proposed ban, stating: “The Commission President discussed this with the UK and other G7 members. We remain in touch with a wide range of European and international partners on their response to the global pandemic”.Under the Commission plans, nationals of all EU member states and countries in the Schengen area, as well as their long-term residents, would be exempt from the ban for the purposes of returning to their homes.The temporary restrictions would also exempt healthcare professionals, frontier workers, diplomats, passengers in transit and those travelling for imperative family reasons, as well as refugees.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have to take exceptional measures to protect the health of our citizens. But let\u0027s make sure goods and essential services continue to flow in our internal market.\u0026nbspThis is the only way to prevent shortages of medical equipment or food. It\u0027s not only an economic issue: our single market is a key instrument of European solidarity. I am in discussion with all Member States so that we confront this challenge together, as a Union.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Projections\u0026nbspsuggested he would do the same in Arizona.“Tonight it looks like we’ve had a very good night…and we move closer to securing the Democratic Party’s nomination for president,” he said in an address live-streamed from his home in Wilmington, Delaware. “And we’re doing it by building a broad coalition that we need to win in November.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a direct appeal to supporters of his rival, he said he and Mr Sanders disagreed sometimes on tactics but were in accord over the need to tackle inequality, access to healthcare and climate change. He also said it was essential the country worked as one to combat Covid-19, which had already led the governor of Ohio to postpone its primary.“Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country,” he said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“So let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what’s at stake. I know what we have to do.”Mr Biden said his goal was to unify the Democratic Party, and then\u0026nbspthe nation. “You know, it’s in moments like these we realise we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans. The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican.”Mr Biden had gone into the latest primaries as the clear frontrunner,\u0026nbsphaving turned around his campaign\u0026nbspfirst with a huge win in South Carolina, and then a string of impressive performances in places such as Texas and Minnesota. His momentum was driven in a large part by the decision by several of the candidates, including Pete Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, to end their campaigns and endorse him.After securing wins in the first three states to vote, Mr Sanders, 78, found himself struggling to appeal to as broad a swathe of the electorate as the former vice president, and was hampered by the fact that traditionally, younger people are the least likely to actually get out and vote.There had been anticipation he might end his campaign last week after disappointing performances in heartland states such as Michigan, but he stayed in, apparently determined to take part in last Sunday’s one-on-one debate with Mr Biden. It seems\u0026nbspthe event did little to boost his numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If this was going to be around for a month, everyone could take on a couple of extra shts.But this looks like it will be around a good few months and its very dficult to sustain that over a period of time, as it becomes unsafe for people to work.We have regulated hours because the longer youre working, the more tired you become and the more likely to make mistakes.What the NHS has always been good at is pulling together in a crisis. We are going to have to roll up our sleeves for the next couple of months until this settles, and morale is good at the moment.Butthis carries on for a long time, fatigue and stress will set in.If over the next six months, one in five people have it we can deal with it. Butfour in five people catch it, the NHS simply cant cope.Dr Rinesh Parmar, , is a speciality registrar in anaesthetics and intensive care in the West Midlands.Dr Parmar says: “It’s feeling really under pressure at the moment and there are frantic plans being made to try and prepare us.Were testing patients every day, but it takes over  hours for us to get a result.We have to assume anyone with breathing symptoms is positive and treat them as such - that’s increasing the workload dramatically. My colleagues are really stretched. There’s obviously so much pressure, but the problem we have is there’s a background of pretty low morale within the NHS anyway.Tap to see where COVID- is near youWe’re already short of staff on any given normal day without the pressure of the pandemic.The NHS has a tremendous ability to instil camaraderie amongst staff, but that’s really being tested at the moment because we all have our own anxieties.My parents are elderly, and they would be in the category where they’ve got underlying health problems, so I’ve stopped seeing them completely.Naturally we’re more susceptible to this, and because we don’t know who’s positive and who’s not, you could come across a patient, be treating them, and not be wearing the full protection.The other worry for doctors is that we’re being told there may be a rationing of personal protective equipment.Plus, the advice for the public [ they come into contact with someone whos infected] would be to self-isolate for seven days.But what’s happening with NHS staff is they start self-isolating, but then many of them have had a phone call asking them to come back into work... potentially becoming a risk to patients and other staff.They’ve spoken about cancelling annual leave for staff. That hasn’t happened yet but they’re compiling a list of volunteers.There’s also plans in place to redeploy other doctors, such as GPs, and bringing retired doctors back too.I worry that we’re leaving this too late for us [UK] to go into lockdown.We’re pretty full and although we can find physical space, the problem is we don’t have the staff.The government have said they’ll try to get more ventilators made, which is great and shows they’re listening, but we need healthy staff to come into work to be able to operate them.Our view is thatyou prioritise the testing of staff, then those of us that are negative can come back and we don’t have to self-isolate for seven days.Day by day we’re getting more and more prepared, but the problem will come when we’re overwhelmed on the unit and we’ve got staff going off sick. Then we’re really struggling.Dr Yaso Browne is a GP in a practice in Southampton. Dr Browne says: As we hear of more cases, our colleagues being affected, and knowing that we don’t have sufficient personal protective equipment, it makes us feel vulnerable.We support the efforts that are out there, but we’re all a bit fearful - we’re not currently being allowed to be tested unless we’re symptomatic.Also,we are, then actually we don’t get the test back in very good time.I think a bit more understanding about the testing, its supply, and what the capacity is would be hugely beneficial.For now, I think the feeling is we’re feeling vulnerable, rather than stressed. I sense people wanting to do something positive to try and help make us feel stronger, for our patients and for ourselves.I’ve actually chosen to limit my interactions with other people, because I’m worried that I’m high risk - so particularly limit interactions with those that I identy as more at risk.I think really it’s just more about trying to reduce the potential that you’re transmitting to family members. I do have loved ones that I’d worry about because they are at risk.But that’s also why you’d want to knowyou’ve had COVID, because then you’d probably be more able to have those social interactions.We haven’t seen any obvious solutions yet, so it is a really worrying issue for all of us.”Or you can like our coronavirus Facebook page here: https:www.facebook CoronavirusLatestTheSun Leaanne Pallant is a -year-old agency nurse in Hertfordshire. She is married to teacher Richard, and has two children, Poppy, seven and Isla, nine.She says: “On Sunday I worked on an isolation ward where  patients were being tested for the virus and a few were struggling to breathe.There was one case of coronavirus in the hospital at that time, in the Intensive Care Unit , and one case on our ward who was strongly suspected of having it.It was quite scary seeing the specialists dressed in the full-on protective gear. It really hit home that this is getting pretty serious now.All the patients are in separate isolation rooms and nurses or healthcare professionals are having to glove and gown and mask up before we go into that room.Then we have very strict degloving, taking your apron off and then washing your hands in a particular way, to protect yourself.We also have to have a runner so we don’t have to take everything offwe need something brought in, and drug charts are banned, so we’re almost doing patient identication through the window before administering drugs.The NHS was stretched before this, but the coronavirus is putting extra strain on it.As an agency nurse, who fills in on an ad hoc basis, there are a ridiculous amount of shts being advertised out and a lot of people dont want to put themselves in that situation.So nurses are actually cancelling extra shts that they dont have to be doing.I dont worry about myself catching the virus because Im  and I think my immune system is pretty tip top, and the children don’t have any underlying health issues.But  I have an elderly nan who I try and see once or twice a week. Ive had to say to her, ‘Sorry Nanyou need me to do an online shop for you I will but other than that, Im not going to be coming to see you,’ because I could have it and not know.I would never forgive myselfI gave it to her. So there is a lot of trying to distance myself and just be sensible, under the circumstances.As nurses, were exposed to a lot of bugs and viruses and its part and parcel of the job but this is an unknown virus so there are a lot of questions we don’t know the answer to.I went to do my normal weekly shop today and theres literally nothing on some shelves. It was post-apocalyptic.But le has to go on, and all we can really do is try and protect the people that need protecting.The country as a whole is doing what they can and what they need to do.I just hope that everybody is understanding and does isolatethey need to rather than being stupid about it.  Because it could be those few stupid people that ruin it for the majority.”Dr Robert Hirst, , works as an emergency medicine trainee in Bristol. He says: We have a few COVID patients here now, and theres a few more coming in.Were cancelling elective surgeries from Thursday here and just moving to emergency and cancer surgeries primarily.Weve been told were going to be redeployed to whoever needs us in the coming weeks - I imagine Ill be moving into the emergency department or intensive care soon.Its tense at the moment, its quite unknown and we all sort of feel like were at the beginning of something... its probably going to get worse before it gets better.Ive seen emails from other trusts saying the previous advice given doesnt apply to healthcare workers... but luckily no-one has been called in here from self-isolation yet.Its going to be a prolonged process here, it could be six months, there could be another peak in the winter, theyre having to be more sustainable with this.If this was a one-off major event, wed all be called in and it would be all hands on deck for a few days, but this is longer.A main concern for me is I live with my girlfriend and Im worried I could bring my work home with me in a very unpleasant way.Fundamentally wed be fine, but its the chance we could pass it on to my grandparents. We were supposed to meet them this weekend for my birthday but were having to hold off.Normally when you suit up its protection for the patients, but now its protection for the patients and for yourself and anyone  you come into contact with.I know a lot of people are concerned and we hear lots of rumours of young doctors being ill or in intensive care, or even have passed away, so I know its something that weighs on peoples lives.This very much could go downhill, but we just dont know yet.Dr Murray Ellender is a London GP and co-founder of eConsult. “GPs are having to think about fundamentally changing the way we work, and coming up with ways of managing the patients without them necessarily coming into the building.It’s disrupting the model of general practice - which is probably not a bad thing - but it’s happening faster than we would have expected or hoped.There’s a lot of worry about coronavirus and people with respiratory symptoms, but we’ve also got the everyday general practice with people coming in needing repeat prescriptions or with other health conditions.We’re having to manage the normal day job as well as people presenting with respiratory problems.It’s putting all sorts of pressures on the system and there’s the added concern of how we look after the workforce.If you’ve got a practice that’s got four or five GPs, you might have one who’s pregnant who’s now been advised they shouldn’t be at work, what impact does that have on the rest of the practice staff We’re having to manage increased demand with perhaps a slightly diminished workforce.Most GP practices, which have around , patients typically, are now looking at how they can work together when doctors are having to go into isolation.I’ve got a couple of colleagues who’ve had confirmed coronavirus. One of my partners is Clare Gerada, who’s been in ious press at the weekend talking about her experience of the illness.We have others who are now in isolation because they’ve either got symptoms or are pregnant.What we’re thinking through now is, ‘How can we still make use of their expertise and get them working from home ’Anyone who is in isolation who is feeling well enough to work can use a laptop to deal with certain patient queries remotely. And actually that helps them support the wider system.The system we founded, eConsult, is used in around , practices across the UK with half of all practices using that or a similar online consultation system.But half the country has nothing and the NHS is scrambling to make online consultation available to everyone.Practices are now asking, ‘How can we get this  And fast ’Last year, we were bringing about  practices a month on board. In the last couple of weeks, we’ve been bringing about  practices a day. It’s just gone nuts.There is a certain amount of fear amongst clinicians as well as the general public.We have some who’ve got long-term conditions or are the carers for elderly relatives.As so often happens, we don’t do enough in any society to look after healthcare workers. And they don’t tend to be very good at being looked after either - they tend to make very bad patients!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And you’d also hope they take more care than they did with the actual production, which started to betray a “will-this-do ” attitude with almost its first caption of the night.“Dermot Munaghan.” And the next one: “Colston Smith.” .A foretaste of what was to come, because the event had technically unravelled within the first hour when Lineker had to introduce a comedy sketch about VAR and the  World Cup final.First it appeared, then it vanished. So Lineker explained the punchline: VAR had not just found in England’s favour it had decided to award the  World Cup to Scotlandand Euro  to Wales.Then the sketch suddenly reappeared again and took six minutes to reach its bloody, teeth-pulling conclusion: “I’m going to change my name to Jamie VAR-dy.”In such circumstances, you can sit and hope the rest of Sport Relief moves, inspires and thrills with a perfect blend of laughter, compassion and entertainment.And I can also hope Scotland are going to win the next World Cup. It ain’t going to happen.Sport Relief is never ever over quickly, ’cos there are a whole load of BBC formats to be put through the ringer, like Line Of Duty, and far too much dancing, featuring everyone from Lineker and McGuinnes to a “social media influencer”, called “HRVY”, which wasn’t another spelling mistake. I think he’s just an RSHOL.At ious other points in this back-of-a-fag-packet evening: Hockey player Sam Quek took , football penalties against a short fat bloke, from point-blank range, and contrived to miss more than a quarter of them. Mel Giedroyc farted on a Question Of Sport special. Rylan accused Romesh Ranganathan of being over-exposed, before playing Andy Murray at crazy golf. And they flagged up an Action Line number, for people who were feeling “emotionally vulnerable”, after the Killing Steves parody, which may have been the most benevolent gesture in the event’s history.What really irks about Sport Relief, though, is that, evencompassion fatigue has never been more of a problem, they’ve decided it’s a triumph before it’s broadcast and the “Best Bits” Sunday show is all ready to go.Corporate backing also means there’s little risk of them not beating the previous total either, which, I hope, doesn’t sound like I’m diminishing the sincere efforts of the public.If there’s one thing I’ll remember about Sport Relief , however, it’s the contribution of David Beckham, who, infor a y advertorial for his new MLS franchise and some crashing product placement , offered two entire people the chance to attend an Inter Miami game and win a shirt signed by such global talents as Lewis Morgan and A J DeLaGarza, who’s played  entire games for Guam.There are moments when the generosity and humanity of celebrities simply overwhelms me.This wasn’t one of those moments.Bloke.CHANNEL  seemed to have all bases covered for its hugely entertaining new dating show Five Guys A Week, at least in terms of complete bellends.So, crammed into a semi-detached house in St Albans, hoping to win the heart of its owner Amy, it had: Christian, whose job “isn’t as glamorous as it sounds” . Uber-woke Glen, from accounts. A stuntman called Michael, who seemed to have mistaken the show for SAS: Who Dares Wins and voluntarily withdrew on day two. Mad, goggle-eyed surfer Trystan, who appeared to be casing the joint for a “kill room”. And the lowest form of le known to any single thirtysomething man – the bloke with the acoustic guitar, Scott, who used to be a bank manager, but now earns a living as a country and western singer and will be performing under the stage name Johnny Cashpoint,he’s got an ounce of sense.The five were chosen for their ability to get right on the viewers’ nerves rather than real boyfriend potential, obviously.And it made for a cracking hour of TV, because they all competitively fancied the pants off Amy, who looked like a younger and much hotter Camilla Parker Bowles,you can imagine such a thing.The show’s greatest strength, of course, is also its biggest format failing, as I’d imagine no one wanted any of them to win.In the event, however, it came down to a straight fight between the lesser of two evils and, probably wisely, Amy chose cocky Christian, who’s looking to whisk her off for breakfast in France, ahead of grovelling Glen, who, rather than looking for “the Michelle Obama to my Barack”, should probably be aiming for the Michelle Collins to his Ian Beale.Five Guys A Week, C, tonight, .pm.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What caused the cancellation of six Wimbledon championships in the s ”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in north-east England shares its common name with the body of a ship ”Spin To Win, Phillip Schofield: “What Saturday night TV show is Anton du Beke most famous for ”Hunted, Dan: “Who painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel ”LISA NANDY wasn’t born stupid.

Chunk didn’t.To his eternal credit he ignored two ad breaks and kept up the pressure for a spellbinding  minutes that only ended when Nandy offered to settle the issue of whether Floyd Mayweather should be able to box women by “setting up a commission”.To which Piers responded: “It’s not a commission issue, it’s a common sense issue.”But that, as a wise man once said, is the problem with common sense, Piers.

They are resilient. You aren’t going to like it, but you’ll get through it.“You can compare it to the Blitz. People got through the Blitz. It was very stressful but they did it.”My elderly mother lives just a few roads away from me and, like so many with similarly vulnerable relatives, I’m making sure she’s OK.“Just pop a tin of Spam through the letterbox, and I’ll be fine,” she joked in reference to her time growing up during World War Two.But yesterday, three of her immediate neighbours — one of whom she’s never met — put notes through her door to say she should give them a callshe needed anything.In times of such crisis, our first thought is naturally of ourselves and our immediate loved ones.But it seems the upsideof the world slowing down and re-grouping might be that, no longer distracted by the busyness of our normal working days, we will “look up” and “reach out”, as they say in business circles, to those in our communities who might need help.There are plenty of people who already do sterling work in their area, but the onslaught of the coronavirus will perhaps lead to everyone now doing their bit.Quite right too. But the onus can’t solely rest on the shoulders of iniduals, so it’s only right the Government has stepped up to offer some practical help to businesses that will suffer throughout the coming weeks and months.Boris Johnson’s advice that people shouldn’t go to pubs cafes theatres etc is understandable in health terms, but will leave businesses facing a critical downturn in custom through no fault of their own.Yesterday, London restaurateur James Chiaini urged him to “crack open the war chest” and allow local businesses to stay afloat while simultaneously channelling efforts towards helping out in their immediate communities, and it seems that new Chancellor Rishi Sunak has listened.In James’s case, he has staff on hand and lots of food supplies, so instead of shutting down because there are no customers, he and other restaurants across the country could potentially now operate a batch-cooking and delivery service for those in need.Equally, the skill sets of many other businesses can be channelled into providing much-needed, state-funded help where it’s required.And the Government shouldn’t stop there. It should repurpose certain facilities too.Last week, it was reported that the £million Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Loughborough, Leics, is currently seriously underused because only current personnel can access it and only  have done so in the past  months.Madness. At the very least, it should be thrown open to all injured veterans who currently have to go through the overstretched NHS.Or how about temporarily repurposing it as a treatment centre for anyone who could benefit from its facilities, thereby alleviating some of the pressure on local hospitals The Government is clearly in uncharted territory right now because it is dealing with an unprecedented situation.But a continuation of joined-up thinking on how best to get us through this critical phase in our history will ensure that Britain’s enviable “Blitz spirit” is encouraged and kept strong for as long as it needs to be.PRINCE Harry is now back behind the closed doors of his rented Canadian mansion, licking his wounds after his public humiliation at the hands of phone pranksters.During a chat with what he thought was climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Harry pledged his support to the non-existent island of “Chunga-Changa” and failed to question why the hoaxers wanted to ship penguins to the North Pole when they’re actually native to the South Pole.Poor Harry.Still, it perhaps explains why, despite attending Eton, he got D at geography A level.Indeed, on all our faces in these challenging times.Heartfelt congratulations to her and husband Chris.FORMER All Saints star Nicole Appleton has given birth to her second child, a girl called Skipper, at the age of .“After hiding my pregnancy for the last nine months – which was so dficult and keeping her a secret from all my friends – I can finally announce our incredible news!” she wrote on Instagram.Fascinating. It’s one thing wearing a big coat out in public, but how do you hide a growing bump from “friends” Has Nicole, whose boyfriend is Stephen Haines, been in pre-emptive self-isolation for the past few months Or is it simply that her petite frame and enviably taut stomach muscles meant she just looked like the rest of us after a big meal Personally speaking, by month seven I looked like I had a medicine ball stuffed up my frock.STORMZY reportedly ripped up his travel plans after meeting Victoria’s Secret model Yasmine Aisha Khala Holmgren backstage at a gig in Stockholm.The pair are said to have holed up in a hotel room for two days where, according to a friend of the grime star, they wanted to spend “quality time” together.That’s one way of putting it.A NEW biography about former Commons Speaker John Bercow claims that he didn’t speak to a female aide for the entirety of a nine hour flight – because he was furious that his toothpaste had been confiscated at airport security.Quite what it had to do with her is anyone’s guess.But one imagines she was grateful for the prolonged period of peace.HANNAH SMITH, a -year-old mum of one, has been handed a suspended sentence after admitting the crime of harbouring a criminal.Her boyfriend, violent robber Luke Harvey, scaled the wall of HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire, where Hannah was waiting to drive him to Skegness for a weekend away.They were later pulled over by police and Harvey, , had ten months added to the -year sentence he received in .Leicester Crown Court was told that the couple had now split up.Presumably, actually spending time together proved too much.HERE is yet another photograph of the singer and actress Jenner Lopez looking sensational at .

To do so, they used the tail of the narwhals, called the fluke.Zackary, of Arizona University, said: “The narwhal tusk is a sexually selected signal that is used during the male-male tusking contests.The information that the tusk communicates is simple: ‘I am bigger than you’.”The narwhal is a medium-sized species of whale with a large tusk that ies from in to more than ft — earning it the nickname the “unicorn of the seas”.In fact it is not a true tusk but an enlarged spiral-shaped canine tooth that pushes through the narwhal’s flesh.The findings were published online by the journal Biology Letters.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Britons were told not to travel anywhere in the world unless it is essential as the world continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab imposed the tightest possible restrictions on people’s travel plans, telling citizens not to leave the country, as other nations shut their borders. Staycations were also restricted as travel within the UK was cut back, and holiday firms shut parks and campsites. Tens of thousands of British citizens could be stranded overseas,with flights across the globe grounded amid serious fears for many airlines’ futures. The RAF and Royal Navy could be drafted in as a last resort to help repatriate stranded UK nationals, Mr Raab said. He told the Commons today: “UK travellers abroad now face widespread international border restrictions and lockdowns in ious countries. The speed and range of those measures across other countries is unprecedented. “So I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against all non-essential international travel.” The travel advice will last at least  days, and Britons who are already overseas are being told to plan theirto the UK now. Britons who decide they still need to travel abroad despite the advice should beware of the increased risk of being stranded overseas, Mr Raab said. He added: “What we do is provide the clearest guidance and unless there is a very good reason, an essential reason to travel, we’re saying don’t take the risk now because you’re at a heightened risk of being stranded in the future.”  The change in official advice is likely to help Britons claim on their travel insurance. It is thought to be the first time the Foreign Office has taken the step of advising against all non-essential travel to all parts of the world since the travel advisory system was introduced in . The Government will help companies to maintain the flow of goods to the UK, while also protecting staff in the sector, he added. Mr Raab continued: “We do regard this kind of travel as essential and we will work with industry to issue detailed advice which maintains the flow of goods whilst protecting the wellbeing of staff who are working on those routes.”  Meanwhile, Easter has been cancelled for tens of thousands of holidaymakers as emergency measures hit the nation’s staycation hotspots. With Britons advised to avoid all non-essential travel within the UK, holiday camps, bed and breakfasts, and theme parks are likely to suffer major financial losses over the upcoming long weekend. Center Parcs was the first of the UK resorts to announce it will be closing its doors over the prime break period, leaving many people’s holiday plans in tatters. All five of its villages will shut from Friday until April , including its Aqua Sana spas at the centres in Sherwood Forest, Notts Elveden Forest, Suffolk Longleat Forest, Wilts Whinfell Forest, Cumbria and Woburn Forest, Beds.  The firm said: “We will be in contact with guests due to arrive during the closure period to move their break to a dferent date or arrange a full refund as soon as we can. We recognise that this will be disappointing news for anyone looking forward to their break. “We would like to thank our guests for their patience and understanding in these exceptional circumstances and look forward to welcoming them back later in the year.” The National Trust will lock the doors of all its stately homes from Friday, with cafes, restaurants and shops also closing. But it plans to keep open parks and gardens open for families who need to get some air. Director general Hilary McGrady said: “While we will close our indoor areas to help fight the spread of coronavirus, we recognise that people are likely to need access to open space and to nature, beauty and history.” David Weston, of the Bed and Breakfast Association, said the £billion sector is struggling as guests cancel breaks. He said: “BBs rely on Easter as the start of the main season, but bookings have dried up. Cities have been hit hardest, but we are trying to carry on the best we can.” The British Holiday and Home Parks Association, which represents , caravan and campsites, as well as self-catering chalets, said it there were “a few reports of parks closing temporarily as a result of the coronavirus outbreak”.  And Mother’s Day is also off as families axe plans for Sunday lunch and afternoon tea, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s advice to avoid pubs, bars and restaurants. Danni Parker, manager of the William Walker pub in Winchester, Hants, said the business has taken a hit: “Mother’s Day is not looking to be a sell-out like it usually is.” Ryan Sims-Atkins, manager of the Stanhope Arms, near Ilkeston, Derbs, said there had been a drop in bookings. He said: “It’ll get worse before it gets better. It’s worrying, really.” Trade body UK Hospitality said the sector has suffered a % slump in bookings for events, conferences and hotel rooms for the next two to three weeks. Boss Kate Nicholls said: “The hospitality sector is facing a unique short-term cash flow catastrophe as customers are advised to stay away.” Last night, staycation giant Butlin’s said it was “watching and following the latest Government advice”.  While its seaside resorts at Minehead, Somerset, Bognor Regis, West Sussex and Skegness remained open, the firm said it is “working hard on what this means for your holiday”. On the Butlin’s website, it said it would “be posting an update as soon as possible”. But the firm told the Mirror that it was “unable to comment” at this stage on whether it would close over Easter. With London said to be the epicentre of the epidemic, several museums have closed with the Tate, VA, British Museum and Natural History Museum all affected. And the Campaign for Real Ale, which runs over  local beer festivals across the country, has cancelled all events planned between now and the end of June, including the Great Welsh Beer Festival which was to have made its debut on April . Church of England cancels services Sunday services will be scrapped for the time being after the Church of England banned all communal worship to fight the virus. Services like Mothering Sunday and Easter - the holiest day for Christians - will be suspended.

Stricken firms will be offered £bn loans, zero business rates and £, in cash grants for small businesses. And homeowners will be offered a three-month mortgage payment holiday by their lenderthey need it. It comes after Boris Johnson last night told people not to go to pubs, clubs and restaurants to stop the spread of COVID- - prompting warnings of an economic meltdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: We will act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy. Announcing the measures at a No press conference, he added: This enemy can be deadly - but it is also beatable. Chancellor Rishi Sunak described the interventions in the economy as a scale almost unimaginable a few weeks ago. The Tory said: This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy. This is time to be bold. For courage. But unions said the measures must go further to help the lowest earners and not be a bailout for boardrooms alone. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn added: The government has announced a mortgage holiday for homeowners but it must suspend rents too. Millions of people rent in the UK. Suspend rents. Ban evictions. Now. Mr Sunak said that measures would be announced in the coming days to help protect people who rent. He said: The biggest fixed costs that many families face will be their rent payment and it is right that we have regard to that. What I can tell himis that the Housing Secretarywill in the comings days be making a statement with further measures to protect renters through these dficult times. And Labour leadership candidate Sir Keir Starmer said: The Government has finally recognised this is an economic crisis, but it is obvious the measures announced by the Chancellor don’t go far enough. There is no support for millions of renters, no new money for social care or the elderly. There is no clarity on employment support and no new money for already stretched public services. Here is a summary of the measures announced tonight and what they mean for you. Mortgage holders will be offered a three month payment holiday  Mortgage lenders have voluntarily agreed to help customers who have issues with their finances as a result of Covid-. Those measures will include a three-month payment holiday. The Treasury said all lenders represented by UK Finance, including the  big banks, were taking part. The move is for residential mortgages. Buy to let borrowers should get in touch with their lenderthey are in payment dficulty to discuss options, the Treasury said. The Chancellor said: For those in dficulty due to coronavirus, mortgage lenders will now offer a three month mortgage holiday. So people will not have to pay a penny towards their mortgage costs while they get back on their feet.” People who take a three-month mortgage holiday shouldn’t see their credit rating affected, the Business Secretary said. Alok Sharma told Sky News: “The FCA has talked to banks and lenders about this issue, particularly those who may need to delay payments on credit card bills etc. “And I think the advice that’s gone out is any changes need to be properly documented and it shouldn’t affect your credit score.”  But thereaposs no specic support for renters Todayaposs announcement had no specic support for renters. In France, rent payments and utility bills have been suspended. These measures have not been announced in the UK. Renters will be given help shortly, the Business Secretary insisted.Alok Sharma repeated a pledge by Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who said extra help will be given in the next few days. Mr Sharma told Sky News: “There are millions of renters across the country and some of them will be facing this anxiety [of arrears or eviction].“The Chancellor was very clear yesterday - he said the Housing Secretary will be coming forward very shortly to set out a statement on how we will make sure there’s protection for renters as well.” Businesses will get £bn in loans - and it could be more  The biggest announcement was a £bn offer of loans to businesses large and small to cope with the short-term crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: “That means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, salaries, suppliers, or purchase stock will be able to access a government loan on credit on attractive terms.” If demand is greater than that, he said, he will go further and “provide as much capacity as required”. A new legal power will be taken to “offer whatever further financial support is necessary” in the future. The £bn of loans will be provided in two ways, the Chancellor said. For big firms, there will be a new lending facility arranged through the governor of the Bank of England. For smaller firms, a new business interruption loan scheme - which was announced at last week’s Budget to deal with coronavirus - will be extended from £.m to £m per firm. No interest will be due on those loans for smaller firms for the first six months. “Both of these schemes will be up and running by the start of next week,” he said.  Small pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues will be able to get £, cash loans - IF they donapost have insurance  The government announced a huge scheme of £, cash grants for “pubs, clubs, theatres and other hospitality, leisure and retail firms”. The Chancellor had already said business rates won’t apply this year to retail, hospitality and leisure venues with a “rateable value” between £, and £,.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe government faces anger after leaving renters and zero-hour workers out of a £bn coronavirus crisis package - despite Boris Johnson vowing to support the whole economy. MPs, trade bodies and unions have called for more support sooner than planned, as the UKaposs death toll reached  and Brits are encouraged to remain at home wherever possible - putting many jobs at risk. The measures, revealed yesterday by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, include mortgage payment freezes for those in financial dficulty, £bn in loans and £bn in other support for businesses. But many critics believe the rescue package has ignored renters, the self-employed and the redundant, as well as those in insecure jobs. Last night Mr Sunak said extra measures would be announced in the coming days to help protect people who rent - but he did not say what they were. He also said urgent talks were under way with unions about a package of employment support. The Chancellor told MPs: The biggest fixed costs that many families face will be their rent payment and it is right that we have regard to that. The Housing Secretary will in the coming days be making a statement with further measures to protect renters through these dficult times. Measures could include protection from eviction, one of many moves demanded by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. But the decision to make the announcement from the Housing Department, not the Treasury, signals there may not be a major financial bailout for renters - such as suspending their payments altogether. Chancellor Rishi Sunak described the interventions in the economy as a scale almost unimaginable a few weeks ago. The Tory said: This is not a time for ideology and orthodoxy. This is time to be bold. For courage. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: The government has announced a mortgage holiday for homeowners but it must suspend rents too. Millions of people rent in the UK. Suspend rents. Ban evictions. Now. Renters will be given help shortly, the Business Secretary has insisted. But sources said it was too early to say exactly when. Alok Sharma told Sky News: “There are millions of renters across the country and some of them will be facing this anxiety [of arrears or eviction].“The Chancellor was very clear yesterday - he said the Housing Secretary will be coming forward very shortly to set out a statement on how we will make sure there’s protection for renters as well.” £ billion in business handouts - or  percent of GDP - will be lent or give as aid to help firms across the UK pay for supplies, overheads and staff wages - while rates relief in the hospitality sector and funding grants for small businesses will also be available. Mortgage lenders, meanwhile, have agreed to afford certain people a three-month aposholidayapos depending on how badly they have been impacted by Covid-. Travel bans have swept the world, with many countries closing their borders, leaving planes grounded - and the Government is considering support for the resultant struggling airlines. Labour chairwoman of the Commons Business Committee, Rachel Reeves, has slammed the Government over its aposfailureapos to take note of Brits already on statutory sick pay, self-isolating or without work. While unions have questioned the lack of measures aimed at freelancers and temporary workers, and some politicians want more support for renters. Mr Sunak has, however, promised more measures in the next few days. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn wants the Tories to suspend home rental fees and ban evictions of tenants during the crisis, ahead of Mr Johnsonaposs appearance at Prime Ministeraposs Questions at midday. Many firms and trade bodies have welcomed the measures but admitted they had yet to properly review all the details.

Cummings’ friend said: “This picture is taken at the height of a Quentin Tarantino obsession. His Reservoir Dogs phase,you like.” In Taking Control: The Dominic Cummings Story, to be shown tonight, Mr Perry told Emily Maitlis of his encounter with Cummings. He said: “We had to come down a rather narrow flight of steps from the studio. Suddenly I felt he’d grabbed my shoulders from behind and was trying to push me down the steps. I managed to keep my footing and make my way to the bottom. “I turned around to confront him and he seized me by the tie, pushed me against the wall and raised his fist. “My main feeling was one of self-preservation, to get out of his clutches.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk already 55000 coronavirus cases","story":"NewsUK may already have , coronavirus cases - and can expect , deathsSir Patrick Vallance, the governments chief scientic advisor, said the hope is to reduce the number of deaths to , but tens of thousands of cases are already in the communityShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsPeople in gloves and face masks walk down Regent Street in London \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Sir Patrick Vallance said the figure was a reasonable ballpark despite just over , COVID- cases being confirmed through testing. He added the hope is we can get it down to around , deaths, from a previous prediction of ,, by using stringent measures to keep people at home. Sir Patrick said annual excess deaths from seasonal flu were around ,. He added: If we can get this down to numbers , and below, thataposs a good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get to with this outbreak. But thataposs still horrible. Thataposs still an enormous number of deaths and itaposs an enormous pressure on the health service. Having spent  years as an NHS consultant as well as an academic, I know exactly what that looks and feels like.The expert told MPs each patient was currently infecting two to three others, so there was a lag time of weeks before the infection rate would start to come down.Health Committee chairman Jeremy Hunt asked whether the expected death rate was one fatality for every , cases, which would mean that there is potentially , cases.Askedthat felt right, Sir Patrick said: Weaposve tried to get a handle on that in Sageandyou put all the modelling information together, thataposs a reasonable ballpark way of looking at it. Itaposs not more accurate than that. The government has been slammed for not testing everyone with symptoms. Sir Patrick admitted he was pushing very hard for a big increase in testing adding: We simply donapost have mass testing available for the population now. Thereaposs a big effort going to to try to get that in place as quickly as possible. Boris Johnson last night announced stringent measures advising people against travel, going to pubs and going to work where possible after a study warned merely mitigating the disease could cause , deaths.Today the PM told the cabinet coronavirus is a war which must be won today, as ministers scrambled to ease the impact of Covid- on businesses. And he revealed a new aposministerial structureapos - with four new committees to deal with the fallout of the pandemic. Sir Patrick told MPs case isolation would bring the peak down by about %, whole household quarantine by about % and general social distancing measures by about %. Social shielding of the elderly has less of an effect on the peak but a much bigger effect on death rates, he said. Together you should expect those to have a very signicant effect on the peak, he said. Sir Patrick said closing schools was still on the table - but it was not the action with the biggest impact.  He said: When we looked at all the intervention we looked at doing the ones which had the biggest impact first. School closing is a measure lower down the list than those we have announced - that doesnapost mean it doesnapost have any effect but it is complicated. He raised concerns about workforce issues that would be created by children staying off particularly in the NHS. It is absolutely on the table, as the whole suite of measures are, and the decisions will be made to pull that lever at the right time, but it isnapost without complex consequences, he added. Sir Patrick said it was a semantic dference to argue whether the UK had shted from a process of delaying and mitigating the spread of Covid- to an attempt to suppress it. He told MPs the approach had always been to save lives and protect the vulnerable by delaying and suppressing the peak of the outbreak and shielding those most likely to be badly hit. In response to questions on the Imperial College modelling, he said: Itaposs a semantic dference whether you are calling it suppression, delay or mitigation - the aim is exactly the same, which is how do you keep this thing down, and how do you keep it below the level at which you want to keep it, and how do you keep it down for long enough to ensure that youaposve actually managed to achieve that suppression.

While the virus remained in the air for up to three hours, it became less infectious overtime. It was more robust on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, with the virus being detected up to  hours after it was applied to the surfaces.The findings, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, were made by the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University scientists.Meanwhile Leo Varadkar, an Irish Gael politician, praised the efforts of healthworkers. He said: I am so proud of all of them. Not all superheroes wear capes - some wear scrubs and gowns. All of our healthcare workers need us to do the right thing in the weeks ahead. Our community services and hospitals are being tooled up. Essential equipment is on the way. Retired staff are ing to service. People are training for changed roles. And Britainaposs prime minister Boris Johnson said thatthe UK follows scientic advice, it will beat the coronavirus which has so far claimed  lives in the UK with number expected to rise into the hundreds in the coming weeks.In other news, the Government has been urged to ensure pregnant women do not lose out on maternity leave due to the coronavirus. The SNPaposs economy spokeswoman Alison Thewliss called for the Government to back pregnant women, many of whom have been asked to take their maternity leave early which will affect how long they can have off. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he will reflect on the matter with Work and Pensions Secretary Theresa Coffey. Ms Thewliss said: I want to ask the Chancellor what protection is being given to pregnant women around maternity entitlement because lots of women have been asked to take their maternity leave early, which will then affect how long they can stay off at the end of that.

It was like they were herding sheep - it was horrible. When we got to the hotel, we checked in and went down for some food. Weaposd been there  minutes when the general manager came over and said an announcement had been made by the Maltese prime minister that any citizens that have travelled from the UK had got to be on a -day quarantine. He said thereaposd be a ,-euro fine every time youaposre caught out and you may be arrested and held in custody. All the waiters had stopped and turned the TV up when the announcement was being made.

He says the experience has also shown him how serious Coronavirus is and he thinks the UK’s approach to the virus has been lacklustre. He said: We could tell Malta was taking it much more seriously than the UK straight away. I think our approach in the UK is very lacklustre.

The anonymous doctor from the north of England has lashed out at the government and described the scenes at his hospital as “utter carnage”. He claims doctors have been given “crappy paper masks” and not enough protective gear to wear while treating coronavirus patients. In a series of tweets posted earlier today by palliative care doctor Rachel Clarke on his behalf, she slammed Health Secretary Matt Hancock for putting doctors at risk and branded it a betrayal. It comes as the government’s chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told MPs this afternoon that as many as , people in the UK could already have the killer virus. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror The AE doctor, based in the North of England, told Dr Clarke many healthcare professionals are resigned to the fact some of their colleagues will die. He said: “The herd immunity plan was always going to end up with thousands of sick, infectious people swamping the hospitals. “Did no-one actually think about the doctors and nurses who are going to die because of this plan  Did no-one think to start stockpiling PPE in January  “Matt Hancock is totally deludedhe thinks ventilators are what’s key here.

Paper masks and plastic aprons. What a f****** betrayal.” Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced yesterday the NHS would be cancelling non-emergency procedures to focus on fighting Covid-. The government also advised against gatherings at pubs and restaurants, and for over-s to self-isolate for a period of  weeks. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for  days.You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild. Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others DO NOT go to your GP or hospital.Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice.Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  This came after a report by scientists at Imperial College London who warned the government thatthey didn’t change course a quarter of a million people would die in a “catastrophic epidemic”. The furious doctor added: “It is absolute carnage in AE. Utter chaos. We don’t have any proper PPE [protective gear]. We are being given crappy paper masks, not the FFP masks we need.“And not everyone even gets those.

And with the NHS at risk of becoming stretched too far, junior staff will be asked to take on more senior roles, the guidance also states. Clinicians with non-essential managerial roles will likely be moved on to the wards and staff with critical care expertise could be given supervisory positions as part of the shake-up.

Criminal trials are also to be put on hold as part of the ongoing efforts to delay the spread.

All of these drugs are experimental for use in Covid-, but they give reason for modied optimism. But first, some information about the virus we’re confronting. What’s it like  The Covid- virus is extremely small and tricky. It’s only a millionth the size of the human cells it invades, but persuades them to supply it with the building blocks to make up to , new viruses. Then it bursts the cell to liberate its progeny around our bodies. The virus has an outer membrane which disintegrates on contact with soap and water and this is the reason we’re being encouraged to wash our hands for  seconds – to give the virus the time to die. The virus usually enters through the mouth, nose and eyes and, once inside, the spikes on the surface of the virus make contact with a human cell. There’s a place on the spike that fits like a key into a protein, ACE, found on the surface of some human cells, particularly those in the respiratory tract. Hence the classic symptoms of covid infection: continuous cough and shortness of breath, high temperature and pneumonia.ACE also plays a part in controlling blood pressure, and early data from a hospital in Wuhan suggest someone with high blood pressure is vulnerable to infection. The fact that the virus’s entry point is linked to blood-pressure regulation may be signicant.Is there a way to overcome it  While we’re waiting up to a year for a vaccine, a search is going on for an antidote drug that might combat coronavirus. To start off, researchers are sting through drugs already being used against other viruses, including HIV. A superb editorial in the Economist illustrates the possibilities. Following the lead of those first HIV drugs, some of the most promising Covid- treatments are molecules known as “nucleotide analogues”.  They look like building blocks to a virus butit tries to use them to build into viruses they’re stopped from reproducing. One nucleotide-analogue drug that shows promise in fighting Covid- is remdesivir. It was originally developed by Gilead Sciences, an American biotechnology firm, as a treatment for Ebola fever. There are now ious trials of remdesivir going on in Covid- patients. Gilead is organising two in Asia encompassing , infected people in all. The trials are expected to give us preliminary results in mid-to late-April. Other nucleotide analogues are also under investigation. When seven drugs were screened for activity against Covid-, researchers at the State Key Laboratory of Virology in Wuhan isolated ribavirin, an antiviral drug used to treat hepatitis C, and it’s already on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines.  What other drugs could work  Nucleotide analogues aren’t the only antiviral drugs. Second generation anti-HIV drugs, the “protease inhibitors”, when added to nucleotide analogues, revolutionised the treatment of AIDS. Could they do the same for Covid-  Kaletra is a mixture of two protease inhibitors, ritonavir and lopinavir. It was tried in SARS patients in  with some benefit. Will it be effective against Covid-  Another drug, Favipiravir , was developed to treat the flu virus and also might have some effect on Covid-. Then there’s chloroquine, a drug mostly used to treat malaria, shown in the s to curb the ability of SARS to get into cells and once inside them, to reproduce. That’s a promising line of enquiry we’re pursuing. Even some cancer treatments are being considered. Drugs that would kill Covid- is the obvious first step to take, but there are other radical approaches available.What about trying to boost the immune system so we can better fight the infection  Interferons are one option to try out this strategy. They work by stimulating the immune system to attack cells infected with a virus and stop viral replication. Interferons might be a useful for halting the progress of Covid-, possibly used with other drugs. But, then again, sometimes the immune system can overreact to Covid-, doing untold damage to the body. The virus often kills by overstimulating the immune system’s inflammatory response, precipitating organ failure. This over-reaction is mediated by a molecule called interleukin-, which has previously been targeted in autoimmune disease. And we already have a drug to do that. An antibody called Actemrastops interleukin- from working, so damping down the response of the immune system to an acceptable level.It was developed for use in rheumatoid arthritis and China has just approved it for use against Covid-, with promising results so far. We need drugs trials To roll out these experimental drugs what we need is thousands of patients in multiple trials. International trials are therefore a high priority because they’re the only way we’ll get enough numbers to evaluate new drugs. Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, has in mind a “master protocol” for trials in many countries so that patients from around the world could be studied.

AlphaBiolabs is entering the fight against the deadly outbreak with its fast and accurate finger-prick testing kit, the Liverpool Echo reports.A spokesman for the firm said the test can be performed by an inidual or company health professional - and will show whether a person has the infection or not. Unlike many other tests, the firm from Warrington, Cheshire, said its new kit can diagnose Covid- before symptoms appear. AlphaBiolabs said the sample collection method used with this kit is less unpleasant than the nasopharyngeal method used widely where. The company is now targeting businesses and organisations looking to screen their workforces. David Thomas, managing director of AlphaBiolabs, said: “This rapid immunoassay-based test can detect the presence of a Covid- infection without using expensive private clinics or relying on an already-stretched NHS. “Recent studies suggest that a high percentage of patients show no clinical symptoms, which is why the spread of coronavirus is creating major logistical and operational problems for businesses, with no way of predicting how long the pandemic will last or the impact it will have. Human resources teams are having to deal with the physical and emotional concerns of their staff while continuing to perform their duties in this climate of uncertainty. “Immediate results are essentialemployees need to be isolated or quarantined.”He added: “Most companies are putting together plans to have employees working from home but, for many sectors this is not possible, such as distribution, warehousing, logistics or service businesses. “As a testing services provider, we have been inundated by requests from our customers to help address the issue, as a lot of the advice currently available from government, health bodies and the media is very mixed. “We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand by offering a fully-certicated European-registered device which can be used in a healthcare or commercial premises environment. We are proud to be the first UK laboratory equipped to process test results on a mass scale, although we have a limited supply of the kits available.” The rapid coronavirus screening test kit costs £ plus VAT and involves a few simple steps. A blood sample is taken via a finger prick and put into a small screening device to which two or three drops of testing fluid are added. Within  minutes, the results will be shown through the appearance of up to three lines in the detection window of the device. The screening results also provide information on the stage of Covid-, identying whether there has been recent exposure or later infection. The test works by the screening of antibodies immunoglobulin Mand immunoglobulin G . News of the finger-prick test comes after health authorities said the UK currently does not have enough tests to start widespread community screening.

The prince has apparently spoken to his father and grandmother, urging them to stay safe and take extra precautions as the Covid- epidemic quickly spreads across the globe. In an attempt to protect her family - including baby son Archie - Meghan has also reportedly given those staff who buy food and run errands strict hygiene protocol, including wearing latex gloves at all times.While the duchess is said to have whittled the number of people down to a select few who have direct contact to her, Harry and Archie, the friend told the Daily Mail. However, the couple - who officially step down as senior royals at the end of the month - are understood to be liaising with experts about how best to help during the crisis. The source emphasised the Sussexes refuse to simply sit around at home doing nothing and that Meghan has told close friends the pandemic is a mental health crisis.  They are working on an online support system for those who are most vulnerable including new mums battling postpartum depression. People who lack support systems need reassurance that they are not alone, the duchess has apparently said.

Today the supermarket giant became the latest supermarket to restrict the number of items shoppers can buy amid the coronavirus outbreak. Sainsburyaposs boss said the chain had listened to customersapos concerns about the impact of shoppersapos stockpiling behaviour on the elderly and vulnerable, and would be taking action immediately. It comes after shoppers ignored the food industryaposs appeal to shoppers to stop panic buying, as stockpilers continued to strip shelves even after supermarkets placed adverts in national newspapers pleading for calm on Sunday. In an email that will be sent to Sainsburyaposs customers today, chief executive Mike Coupe outlined the storesapos news measures. They include limits on the number of essential products per person, a special shopping hour for the elderly and vulnerable only, and a boost to online deliveries and in-store collection services. The new Sainsburyaposs purchasing limits kick in today, on Wednesday March . They include:Customers will be able to buy a maximum of three of any grocery product. Those limits will shrink to a maximum of two of each of its most popular items including toilet paper, soap, and UHTmilk.More changes will start from Thursday, March . They include:Stores will set aside aside the first hour in every supermarket for elderly and vulnerable customers. If you or an elderly family member, friend or neighbour would like to shop during this hour, you can check online for your local supermarket opening hours. For all other customers, supermarkets will open one hour after the published opening time. Stores will be closing its cafes and meat, fish and pizza counters in supermarkets to free up warehouse and lorry capacity for essential products and allow staff to focus on keeping high-demand shelves stocked. Finally, several more changes will take place from Monday, March . They include:Online customers who are over  years of age or have a disability will have priority access to online delivery slots. Sainsburyaposs will contact those customers in coming days with more details. For any online customer who can travel to the supermarket, stores will operate an expanded aposclick and collectapos service. Sainsburyaposs is signicantly increasing the number of collection sites across the country in coming days in preparation. Customers will be able to order online as usual and pick it up from a collection point in the store car park. Anyone self-isolating is asked to let Sainsburyaposs know to help the supermarket provide the service for them too. Mr Coupe wrote an appeal to stockpilers in the email to customers: As we work to feed the nation, we are also focusing all of our efforts on getting as much food and other essential items from our suppliers, into our warehouses and onto shelves as we possibly can. We still have enough food for everyone –we all just buy what we need for us and our families. He continued with a plea for customers to be appreciative of supermarket workers during trying times. Mr Coupe wrote: I wanted to end by saying a huge thank you to Sainsbury’s colleagues across the business. Everyone is working flat out in dficult circumstances to do their best to serve our customers. If you’re able to say thank you to them when you see them, I know they would hugely appreciate it. It comes after Tesco warned it will reduce its hours in response to stockpiling that has left many of its storesapos shelves stripped bare. The supermarket giant will now open from am and pm as the UK moves to restrict movement in a bid to control the virus and warns Brits away from mass public gatherings.

What about workers and renters, Mr Chancellor  The lack of a direct employment protection and support packages is deeply concerning as grafters lose their jobs. Countries such as Denmark and Sweden, and even Donald Trump’s US, are providing real financial support. That there is no three-month rent holiday for tenants – alongside a promised three-month mortgage holiday for buyers – is an insight into Tory priorities. The low earners, the poorest and most insecure are being abandoned to unemployment and possible eviction. Boris Johnson’s wartime rhetoric is shaping up to be yet another con. In , nobody was left behind. Full employment and rationing in a country that pulled together produced the generation who created the National Health Service, the modern welfare state and mass council housing. Sunak’s talks with trade union leaders must be more than window dressing, an attempt to make it appear he’s listening to everyone. Urgent, immediate assistance to sustain the jobs and livelihoods of jeopardised workers is a bottom line. Betray them and this Tory Government will deserve damnation.

His tail is at the same height as a manaposs groin so they have to be careful playing with him too. Thunder comes from a long line of colossal canines and his dad is a champion show dog. Jenny and Chris had always dreamt of owning a giant Great Dane, so they waited for him to have puppies. The couple adopted Thunder just after he was born and hoped heaposd grow to be as big as his dad. Thankfully, their home sits on five and a half acres of land, giving him plenty of room to play.

The woman was tracked down on the beach on Sunday, after New South Wales health chiefs contacted their colleagues in Queensland, and they sent a team out to find her.

The Brit claims she did not understand the instructions she was given after her diagnosis. A Hamilton Island spokeswoman confirmed an international visitor had tested positive for coronavirus. The statement read: Hamilton Island would like to stress that the safety and wellbeing of our guests and staff on the island is of utmost priority. We would like to remind anyone travelling to the island about the importance of strictly following the advice of the government and health authorities during this uncertain time. There are currently  confirmed cases of Covid- in Australia and five people have died. In Australia, people who test positive are told to self-isolate until they get their results. People who test positive but are not ill enough for hospital are told to home quarantine for -days.However, officials are being urged to dramatically increase testing to get the full picture of the virusapos spread across the country. Dr Ian Mackay, a prominent Australian virologist, toldthe country needs to step up its testing. He said: “If we don’t test, we don’t find.

A few pieces of good news are starting to come out across the world in the fight against the potentially deadly Covid- infection, following travel bans, lockdowns and mass self-isolations. More than , people have been confirmed as contaminated by the disease which has killed nearly , since December, but there does appear to be some hope on the horizon. Over , people have successfully recovered worldwide and in mainland China, where the highly-infectious disease originated, only  new cases were confirmed by officials on Tuesday. Just one of those was a domestic transmission. And despite the death toll in Italy - the worldaposs second biggest hotspot - continuing to skyrocket, the confirmed cases are now slowing. Cases are also declining in South Korea - just  yesterday, a signicant drop from  at its peak just over two weeks ago. This comes as researchers in Rotterdam and Utrecht University claim they have found an antibody that can successfully cure a patient of the disease, reports the Sun.  It could lead to a vaccine and also allow people to test themselves at home, freeing up valuable time for struggling health services across the world. Doctors at the Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipar, India, meanwhile, have been using a cocktail of HIV, swine flu and Malaria medication to cure Covid- patients. The Cleveland Clinic also apparently has technology which can turn around coronavirus tests in eight hours - though it still needs further in-house testing. Japanese pharmaceutical firm Takeda Pharmaceutical Co has revealed it is working on a new coronavirus drug which uses blood plasma of recovered patients, and researchers in Ontario, Canada, have replicated the virus which could prove invaluable for testing.

The military were notied and are trying to identy the thieves using surveillance footage. While the north of Italy has been the worst hit by the virus, there was an exodus to the south before the government brought in the quarantine to stop the spread of COVID-. Tens of thousands are thought to have fled on trains and in cars as the ban was set in motion earlier in March. The country has , confirmed cases, while , people have died at the time of writing.

Saverio Chiaravalle, the vice-president of the Varese doctors order, said: They are all doctors who had no fear of going into combat knowing the risks they were running. “They died on the field, but when you are in combat you don’t imagine it could happen to you.The enemy is invisible, but this is like a war, and the only solution is to isolate – those who have to work must work with precautions, the rest must stay at home. UK citizens have been told not to travel anywhere in the world for at least the next  days. The Government has changed its advice to ban all non-essential travel as it attempts to clampdown on the spread of the coronavirus. If your journey has been cancelled, check the terms and conditions of your booking or travel insurance to see what the small print says. If you have a package holiday booked and part or all of it is cancelled by the organiser airline, you must be offered a refund within  days. Some organisers are offering alternative holidays or allowing consumers to reschedule but this is not a legal remedy. If you booked a flight separately that has now been cancelled, the following rules apply:If your flight was due to depart from the United Kingdom, European Union, Iceland, Norway or Switzerland or was due to arrive in one of these countries via a UK EU airline, you should be offered a choice of three alternatives. If it was a non-EU flight, you will need to check the terms and conditions for the airline.If the FCO advises against all but essential travel to your destination and youaposre flying out from a UK airport, or ing to one, and your flight is cancelled, youaposll be entitled to a refund under a European Union regulation, called EC. Your airline will inform youthis happens, and in some cases you may be able to negotiate to postpone your flight to later in the year.

We’re just taking it day by day, trying to maintain fitness and looking after ourselves as best we can.“It’s a really hard situation to explain. It doesn’t feel real.“We’ve just been told football’s now stopped and we don’t know when we’ll be playing again.“Everything’s just been shut down all of a sudden and it’s a really weird feeling.

We’re similar types of players, we both like to defend first and foremost.“We pride ourselves on clean sheets and things were going reasonably well for us before the shutdown.”Forster – who was in Celtic’s academy before making the senior breakthrough at Hibs – feels he was held back by injuries in the early part of his career and he is delighted to put that frustration behind him.He said: “I feel the best I’ve ever felt physically and mentally.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready. He had a late call to co-drive for Linzi Henderson in her Ford Fiesta but they were one of the unlucky crews to slide off the road in Stage , only a mile from the start, spectacularly attempting to knock down some trees in the process.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was out in the Subaru Impreza of Graeme Sherry in what is slowly becoming a weekend habit # one which has his mother watching nervously from the wings.

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St Boswells.Ms Grahame added: \"As Irsquom sure Councillor Haslam well knows, her letter of February , issued after she claimed the Scottish Government had refused funding, does not constitute a formal funding request, given the lack of any details.\"And I remain unclear why shersquos written as a local ward councillor rather than in her role as leader of Scottish Borders Council.\"I have yet to see any correspondence that shows any formal request to the Scottish Government, let alone anything that constitutes it refusing funding, and Councillor Haslam is now refusing to share any further information.\"It is her complete refusal to engage with me on this matter which has led me to put in a formal FOI request to try to get to the bottom of whatrsquos actually going on.\"This is causing a huge deal of concern in the school community and I, like them, simply want to know what is actually being done to support replacing the school, all politics aside.We did put all the points raised by Ms Grahame to Councillor Haslam.She told us: \"Public consultations are ongoing with parents and users of the school and we will be taking these plans forward with the Scottish Government in a

belonged to the Kerrs family who lived at nearby Ferniehirst Castle. During her stay, she was gravely ill after falling off her horse into a bog. The house is now a four-star visitor attraction telling the story of Scotlandrsquos tragic queen.Born on December ,, Mary was just six days old when her father, King James V of Scotland died and she became queen.As the new monarch was so young, Scotland was then governed by a succession of regents while Mary spent her childhood in France.Mary ed to Scotland in , a widow. Four years later, she married her half-cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and in June  they had a son, James.In , her second husband was murdered. James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, who was generally believed to have been behind the murder, was acquitted.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Every year, as the summer faded into autumn, it gave its gt of apples to anyone who happened to pass. Children from the local village who were always hungry would sit under it and eat ripe apples until they had tummy ache. Old folk would come and collect the apples to make pies, sauces and chutney.When the apples from the lower branches had been eaten, the children would climb and pick the ones higher up. It was a game to catch them and put them in a basket.There were so many apples that the older children had to carry the heavy baskets down to the village and shared the apples with everyone.The tree gave so many apples that everyone in the village had as many as they could eat or use. There were always plenty left over on the ground for the animals and insects who also feasted on the fallen ripe fruit. Thankfully nobody owned the tree, it had seeded itself many years ago on the verge of the road that led to the village.Then one year, a traveller arrived just as the apple tree was beginning to bear fruit. He sat under the tree and admired the beauty of it. The apples were ripening in the sun and one of them fell by his feet. He picked it up and ate it. It was crisp and sweet and really delicious.A group of children arrived from the village. ldquoHello mister, they said with a smile, ldquowersquove come to pick apples. They set about picking the most reachable ripe apples, while of course eating some of them in the process.ldquoWhat delicious apples, I must tell my we and children about them, said the traveller as he set off along the road.ldquoHere, said one of the children, holding out a handful of apples. ldquoThese are really ripe, give them to your family. We have more than enough to carry.The traveller smiled. ldquoHow kind, he said. He put them in his pockets and went on his way.But that evening, the child who had given the apples to the traveller was chastised by her parents. ldquoWhy did you do that  Now that man will come back with his family and take our apples.ldquoBut the tree gives us more apples than we can eat, the girl said, ldquosurely a few can be shared with people outside the village. Besides, the tree is by the side of the road, arenrsquot the apples for everyone, thatrsquos what yoursquove always said ldquoYes, they are for everyone, her father replied, ldquobut not just for anyone.His daughter was confused by this answer she didnrsquot understand what it meant. However, it seemed such a small and unimportant issue that she said nothing more of it. She knew that there would be more than enough apples for everyone, and even anyone.A few days later, when the girlrsquos grandmother went to collect ripe apples for a pie, she met the stranger with his we and two children. They had a small basket full of apples. The family were friendly and greeted the grandmother, but she ed a forced smile. She quickly collected her apples and rushed home.She told about the strangerrsquos family collecting the apples and the girlrsquos father was angry.ldquoSee, he said to his daughter, ldquoI told you they were not for just anyone. Now there will be none left for everyone .But his daughter was still confused. There were always many hundreds of apples. ldquoYou are young and donrsquot understand, he said. ldquoTomorrow we will get up early and make sure we can collect our share of the apples.The following day the family were up at the crack of dawn. They took all the baskets they could and went to the apple tree. Their neighbours peered out of the window, wondering what the family were doing.Then they saw them at the apple tree, filling many baskets of ripe apples. Later in the morning, some children from the village joined them.One of them went to pick up an apple that had just fallen. But the grandmother rushed and snatched it first and put it in her basket. So the child just smiled and gently shook a branch and another fell.When the familyrsquos baskets were full, they carried them back to the house. But it took them three trips, and the father left his daughter to guard the full baskets while he and the rest of the family carried as much they could.ldquoWhy are you collecting so many apples at once  asked one of her friends.The young girl nibbled her lip and looked at the ground. ldquoDonrsquot know really. My father says Irsquom too young to understand, but he says the apples are for everyone but not just anyone.ldquoWhorsquos anyone then She looked up and shook her head: ldquoNot sure, but anyone is taking our apples so we have to get them first.When the children of the village ed home with their apples, they told their parents what had happened.ldquoAnyone is taking our apples, so there will not be enough for everyone.The next day, more families got up early and set off for the apple tree.This time, the apple picking was very dferent to the way it had always been. In the past, people would pick the apples with each other, because everyone knew there was enough to go round. This time they were picking them for themselves.Fights started and people began to pull apples that were not ripe. So many people climbed onto the branches to get the apples that the tree started to creak.Soon, not a single apple remained on the tree. For the first time ever, there were none left for the animals or insects. Some peoplersquos homes were so full of apples that they hardly had room to move inside the house.Other people, who were not quick enough, had no apples at all. Some of these were people who really needed the apples. But those who had many wouldnrsquot share them for fear that anyone would get them.The houses of the people who collected more apples than they needed became full of fruit flies and other insects as their piles of apples began to rot.But the next year, everyone was ready. They had made big baskets and were determined not to miss out. But when they arrived at the tree it was surrounded by a hastily built wall with a guard at the gate.ldquoWho has done this  they cried.It was the king. He had heard of the apple tree and how crisp and sweet the apples were, so much so that people would fight and hoard the fruit. So, as the richest and most powerful man in the kingdom, he decided he would make sure the apples graced his table.ldquoBut there are more apples than the king can eat! protested the people.ldquoIndeed, said the guard ldquoand the King is generous. He will sell you the apples he does not need.ldquoSell them  But the apples have always been free for everyone!ldquoNot any more, said the guard.The young girl went up to her father. ldquoNow I understand, she said, ldquoanyone is the king."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-gp-practices-east-lothian-introduce-new-measures","story":"North Berwick Health Centre has announced that none of its registered patients have tested positive for coronavirus and asked that people phone the Edington Hospital in advance before paying it a visit.Those who think they have been in contact with someone with the virus are asked to not visit the surgery and phone  for advice.From Monday , all GP and advanced nurse practitionerappointment requests will be triagedby phone call.Lammermuir Medical Practice in Haddington has also taken this approach.People who call either practice will be asked for a summary of their symptoms, information about recent travel andthey have been in direct contact with a person that has been tested positive for coronavirus.The inidualrsquos GP will thenthe call anddeemed safe and necessary, they will then be given an appointment for that afternoon.Those with pre-booked appointments with a GP will be contacted by the health centre to discuss arrangements.North Berwick Health Centre has removed its self check in service -people now have to check in with a receptionist.It has also launched a new online prescription ordering service, those not registered can visit northberwickhealthcentre.scot.nhs.uk news,.htm, download a form, fill it in and hand it in.Lammermuir Medical Practice has also disabled its online appointment service.Tranent Medical Practice has made its surgery pod, a self-service device that allows patients to get their weight and blood pressure checked, unavailable for use.Those with routine appointments at Harbours Medical Practice in Cockenzie are asked to phone the practice, pressing option two, as it is making changes to its routine appointment system.It has also asked that people with symptoms, those who have had contact with an infected person or those who have been in an affected place to not enter any of its buildings.Prestonpans Group Practice has also given this advice and asked that evenpeople have mild symptoms they should not visit the surgery.Meanwhile, Orchard Medical Practice in Haddington is asking all patients not to attend the practice but instead to phone to request an appointment.

However, the evidence shows that pupils are more alert, feel better, and pay better attention after self-paced physical activity when compared to just sitting.More than , schools in  countries around the world are said to have taken up the Daily Mile idea in the three years after it started to get publicity in  but not all get pupils to complete a mile every single day.It came after Ms Wyllie decided to take pupils outside for a run after one of the schools local volunteers, an -year-old local landowner who helped out with music, storytelling and teaching the children chess, warned her out of the blue: \"the children at this school are not fit\".For the headteacher of St Ninians Primary in Stirling, it was a watershed moment and from that day on her pupils would leave the class for  minutes every day to walk, jog or run a mile by going around the playground several times.As the weeks went on, other classes and eventually the entire school joined in and the Daily Mile was born Inidual teachers decide when to fit the Daily Mile into the school day, and it is done in addition to existing PE lessons and does not replace the exercise children get while playing during intervals.Ms Wylie had said she had seen for herself how  minutes of daily activity rapidly improved pupils fitness, health and concentration in the classroom. The new report acknowledged that the results did not take into account other factors that can affect wellbeing and cognition such as diet and sleep or other exercise done by children during their leisure time or while travelling to school.The study said further research should explore the influence of these factors on childrenrsquos well-being and cognition after physical activity breaks.Report author Dr Josie Booth said: ldquoPhysical activity is believed to be beneficial to cognition and academic performance however, the evidence for this in children is inconsistent.\"We aimed to examine the immediate impact of short physical activity breaks at school on childrenrsquos cognition and well-being and to determine whether any benefits from this activity were due to the intensity of physical activity or from just taking a break outside of the classroom.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus.

Countries with a more dirigiste approach, like France, and outright authoritarians, like China, are taking the lead with hyper-lockdown backed by fines and riot police and sweetened by bold promises that firms and workers will not lose out.Whether that is possible or just vain-glorious hot air from the Elyseacutee Palace remains to be seen. The Scandinavians are taking a typically communitarian approach and promising people that the state will provide calibrated compensation to bolster incomes. But their social safety net was anyway far more generous than in neoliberal Britain.We have the lowest pensions, the lowest sick pay, the most miserly unemployment benefit and income support. And still millions are unable to access it in the gig economy or because they earn too little. Britain after a decade of austerity is a low-wage, low-security economy, and that isnrsquot going to change overnight. Or could it The country will have to be mobilised as in a war. The Second World War was actually very good for the economy ndash or at least good for GDP. The United States turned industry into a weapons-making machine of unprecedented productive power. The Arsenal of Democracy turned out hundreds of warships, thousands of tanks and bombers, millions of guns, billions of pieces of ammunition.Wages and profits soared during the war economy in America and in those parts of the world not actually devastated by the fighting. It was war production that finally brought the Great Depression to an end. Indeed, it arguably laid the groundwork for the next  years of global economic growth.Full employment became the default policy for western governments. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated. We had the NHS, welfare, mass consumerism. Then came inflation, globalisation, neoliberalism and the financial crisis.After , the Government and the Bank of England mobilised some pound. trillion to stave off a collapse of the financial system. That was a very crude way of dealing with the crisis and created moral hazard by rewarding bankers for their reckless greed.But that isnrsquot going to work this time, evenwe wanted it to. The banking system is not the epicentre of this crisis. And the inconvenient truth is that the Covid- crisis is not going to be like the Second World War.Battleships and Sherman tanks are useless against an enemy like a virus.

The government granted powers to actfood was being withheld from the marketplace, so the Board of Trade could impound it.Appeals As is the case today, the newspapers were full of pleas from government and officials for people not to buy more than required.Queues Very long queues became the norm outside shops and in , new laws were set to ensure a fair way of sharing food so that everyone got what they needed, with each person given a ration card ndash even King George and Queen Mary ndash to ensure an allotment of key foods. The rules were strict and anyone found breaking them would be prosecuted.The Second World War Rationing began on January , , with people having to register at their chosen shop. Aside from petrol, the items first rationed were oz of bacon or ham, oz of butter and oz of sugar a week. From May, rations included oz of cheese and in the summer, oz of tea was allowed. By , milk was rationed. Tins of powdered egg were given out bimonthly, as was powdered milk.Offal It was never rationed and campaigns by the Ministry of Food tried to encourage use of it and other items ndash even sheeprsquos heads.Sweets Sweetie rationing came into force in , allowing oz to everyone over five-years-old, with many adults ndash notably OAPs ndash handing in their coupons to be distributed to youngsters to ensure they would not be turned away from the sweet counter empty handed.Rationing did not end with the close of the war The process of lsquode-rationing- began in , but it was not until July ,  that rationing came to an end with the restrictions on the sale and purchase of meant and bacon lted.Rationing could happen again The Government has insisted Britain has enough food to keep going but stores are placing maximum limits on selected products and shoppers have been urged to ldquobehave responsibly, but ultimately, Health Minister Matt Hancock said ldquowe stand ready to take further measuresnecessary.MAUREEN SUGDEN"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-dirty-ways-leave-lover","story":"THERE have always been a iety of cheesy chat-up lines to pull a partner.

Where services are completely suspended, a full refund will be applicable.Mr Hinkles continued: “I would strongly advise our affected customers to manage their booking through our website as we are experiencing exceptionally high call volumes into our call centre.“The situation is incredibly serious and alongside the obvious health and safety implications, puts the future of the entire aviation industry in jeopardy.#With this in mind, we have joined with other UK carriers to seek emergency measures from the Government to support all airlines in the sector.”Hinkles revealed that Loganair staff have been asked to consider a series of measures aimed at protecting employment levels — including reducing working hours by  per cent and accepting a  per cent reduction in salary as a result or taking a period of unpaid leave.He said: “We are working hard to avoid redundancies and lay-offs as have already been seen at major international airlines and as are likely to follow at several UK airlines in the coming days.”It is expected that a quarter of Loganair’s fleet of  aircraft will be put into temporary storage as a result of the schedule reductions.Full details of how to manage your booking are available on its website at www.loganair.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

NHS Orkney and the Scottish Government have previously indicated, however, that local testing figures will not be released — unless a positive result is confirmed.A statement released by the Scottish Government today announced that the programme of testing for coronavirus will be extended to GP practices, covering up to . million people across all health boards in Scotland.Folk presenting at practices with relevant symptoms, including with flu-like symptoms or general respiratory illness and underlying health conditions will be tested. The programme will also support the continued testing of people admitted to hospital with symptoms. However, those following the guidance to stay at home for seven daysthey have mild symptoms of a new cough or raised temperature will not be routinely tested – and will continue to be advised to only phone NHS  or contact the GPtheir condition worsens.NHS Orkney announced yesterday that, GP practices in Orkney will be changing the way they offer and book appointments to reduce the number of patients attending face to face appointments when they do not need to be examined, from Monday, March . If your GP Practice has previously offered the ability to book appointments online this will stop with immediate effect.In a statement on social media, the health authority explained: #If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-you should self-isolate for  days avoiding contact with other people wherever possible. If after  days or you continue to feel unwell and may need to see a GP, please call and speak to your GP practice.#Prior to an appointment being made a member of your GP Practice may call you to clary whether you have symptoms of COVID-. Following an initial conversation your GP Practice will advise on the most appropriate course of action.#To support in delaying the spread of COVID- we ask that you do NOT attend your GP Practice unless you have been asked to do so.#All appointment requests, repeat prescription requests and general enquiries should be made by calling your GP Practice.#If you already have an appointment booked, your Practice will be in contact with youthey need to change your appointment.#If you are currently being visited by our Community Nursing team you may be contacted to check there is no one in your household showing symptoms of COVID-.#The government believes that surveillance testing will provide real-time information on how the virus is spreading in Scotland, which will inform NHS planning and allow resources to be directed where they are needed most. It has confirmed that key workers such as NHS staff will continue to be testedthey show symptoms.Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood said: “This new approach to testing will enable us to understand the pattern and spread of coronavirus in the community, to develop a clear assessment of the situation and to predict the peak number of cases, without having to test everyone with possible symptoms.“Those with mild symptoms do not need to be tested. They should continue to stay at home for seven days and only contact their GP or their condition worsens.“Everybody has a role to play in helping contain this outbreak by following the latest health advice and basic hygiene precautions such as washing hands frequently, not touching their face and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That means we will continue to plan and prepare for the weeks ahead, working closely with our NHS partners and following national guidance on public health.“Our aim is to ensure the resilience measures we have in place best meet the needs of our local community and minimise disruption as far as possible to the services we provide.#There has been widespread concern regarding visiting cruise ships and the OIC has faced criticism for not shutting its ports.Council leader James Stockan moved to reassure the Orkney public.He said: “Elected members met our senior management team to review the extensive steps already taken to prepare for the likely impact on Orkney of the coronavirus pandemic.#I believe the organisation is well prepared to respond effectively to what is a fast-changing situation.“I am aware there is concern in our community about visits to Orkney by cruise ships. No other port in Scotland has stopped such visits and we are following national guidance on this.“We have had port health procedures in place for many years for dealing with cases of infection aboard ships of all kind. These procedures are aimed at preventing infection coming into the country.”All cruise ships have been asked to provide a maritime declaration of health before visiting Orkney, whether or not they have any illness on board.Cruise companies are already well underway with cancelling voyages.The council saysthere was a suspected case of Covid- aboard a ship, the council’s port health and NHS Orkney’s public health teams would work in conjunction with Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Government to decide on the best course of action to take.If a situation of this kind arose, the most likely outcome is that the ship would be redirected to a port on the Scottish Mainland close to more specialist health facilities, OIC adds.Councillor Stockan added: “Although there has been a focus on cruise ships, people do of course travel to and from Orkney by other means — and that makes it very dficult to prevent the spread of the virus into the county.#This makes it all the more important that we as a council — and our wider community — do all that we can to reduce the potential impact on us all.”To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and to protect local communities as far as is practicable, OIC is only allowing travel by staff and elected members to meetings and training events on the Scottish Mainland in exceptional circumstances.In Orkney, councillors and staff will not be attending community council and other public meetings.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Fureys - I will love you. This is a breathtaking love song.I imagine this is how my parents were. . Sylvester - Do ya Wanna Funk  This is my No dance tune.It reminds me of our disco dance team at Ballykeel youth club.Later during our Rave years BinMan used to play this as a mix.It was lethal. I left all those tapes behind when I moved back from England. A huge regret.I’d love to hear them again. Especially this mix. . Glee cast - Oh Holy Night. This is thee most beautul Hymn.I love the lead up to Christmas. It’s a constant in my house. On repeat! I gave off to my girls about watching yet more American rubbish and then became utterly addicted to Glee myself. Their covers are often better than the originals. . Donna Summer - McArthur ParkIn our house I would have frequent discos with my girls.We didn’t have much and often le was hard but we always danced and put on shows. It’s was disco, disco, disco!We had to see who could hold the Note the longest. A few years back Santa brought me a new record player and the girls bought me this album.It’s still a favourite with the  of us. They still love the ‘old’ tunes. . James Arthur - Falling like the stars. I love James Arthur.This song is another level. It reminds me of my partner. . Eurthymics - Here comes the rain again. Another one that should only be played with serious volume. Annie Lennox was so cool. I aspired to have her hair styles.I loved so many of their songs and I still do. . Fleetwood Mac - Songbird. My Shared No album.I got the record again a few years ago and listening to this with the crackle of the record player is a rush of memories Reo Speedwagon ‘Hi Infidelity’ is the other No album I know every word to.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/a81a8305-8941-4184-938b-d8cf49594400-e1584361711502.png","title":"keep the virtual presses rolling by subscribing to our e papers","story":"OVER the coming weeks, as the Coronavirus crisis most likely deepens, our priority will be to ensure our communities stay safe and healthy.As newspapers based in the heart of vibrant communities on both sides of the Atlantic, we recognise our special role in providing a measured, vital news service to our readers.We also have an obligation to bolster small businesses — the advertising backbone of our papers — who face uncertain times.Already many of those small businesses have either signicantly reduced their operations or, in the case of many entertainment venues, closed their doors for at least two weeks.That in turn will mean a precipitous drop in the display advertising revenues we depend on to keep thepresses rolling, pay staff and meet our overheads.One way in which you can support our teams is by taking out a subscription to our epapers.

The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram.

Its job is to keep you safe from nasty germs that might infect you and most of the time it does a great job. This is why pc of people will fight this virus with minor symptoms.But sometimes your immune system isn#t up to the job. This can be because you become infected with a massive dose of a virus, which runs amok and makes you feel awful. Or perhaps you are over  and, like most things in your body, your immune system is less able. Or you might be taking drugs that suppress your immune systemyou have an inflammatory disease. Oryour heart or lungs are weak, the virus can really harm you. So the question is, is there anything you can do to boost your immune system  The answer is a resounding yes.Look after your immune systemTo know how to take care of your immune system, first you need to understand the weapons your immune system has, which are actually very impressive. When you come into contact with a germ you#ve never met before you#ve got ious barriers to try to stop it getting into your body. As well as skin, you have mucus - snot is a really important barrier as it traps germs and has special biochemicals that can kill them, in this case mainly bacteria. Your body is also actually covered in bacteria, inside and out , and many of these are beneficial. They out-compete the bad guys and even make chemicals to poison them. This stops the invader from eating the resident bacterias# lunch.The germs can sometimes win, however. They have cunning tricks up their sleeves to breach the defences. A virus like SARS-CoV burrows inside the cells that line your lungs. That#s where they multiply. However, pretty soon the rapid response unit of your immune system will arrive. Special white blood cells can attack the invader. So-called macrophageseat the germs up and destroy them. They also call the alarm to bring out another white blood cell called a T lymphocyte. These are like police superintendents, controlling everything and even killing off the virally-infected cell themselves to stop the virus spreading. It#s the T lymphocytes that remember, so that when you get reinfected they are good to go. T lymphocytes are an important aspect of why vaccines work. They also control another important white blood cell, the B lymphocyte. This is the cell that makes antibodies. These are very specic proteins that are great at stopping a virus like SARS-CoV in its tracks and B lymphocytes also remember.We remain optimistic that there will be a vaccine soon. Vaccines are weakened forms of a germ or part of it, which causes a weak immune response. But the cells of the immune system are now trained. And when the intruder comes they kill it. It#s a bit like the sherf has put up wanted posters around town and when the bad guy turns up he#s recognised and killed quickly and you won#t even know you#ve been infected. This is why it#s so important to get a vaccine for Covid-.What can you do The trick is to keep all these cells of your immune system fit and healthy. This begins with what you eat. A ied diet with lots of high-fibre foods really boosts your immune system - immune cells love healthy food and hate fatty foods, so a healthy diet is essential.Also,you don#t over-eat and have good gaps between meals, this really mobilises the immune system increasing the numbers of immune cells by as much as three-fold, so lay off that second piece of pie and have gaps of at least four hours between meals. Don#t over-do this, though, as being malnourished has a hugely negative effect, as can be seen in developing countries where it#s a huge cause of death from diseases like TB.Do probiotic drinks work The evidence for taking probiotic supplements is mixed. It#s much more effective to change your diet to a healthier one.And what about vitamins Vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. It is used by our immune cells, and is something that people across the island of Ireland can get quite low on in the winter. So it#s good to take in more of it. Taking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for those who are well-fed. Eating your five-a-day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. It#s water soluble so you will just pass any excess into your urine.Stay activeTo be immunologically fit, you also need to be physically fit. White blood cells can be quite sluggish. Exercise mobilises them by increasing blood flow in your body, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy all over your body. Adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least  minutes a week of moderate aerobic activityor  minutes of vigorous activity . Either suffice.The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. Anything#s better than nothing. But a letime#s exercise could signicantly stop your immune system declining with age. In , a study found that  non-smoking amateur cyclists aged  to  still had the immune systems of young people.Like eating, you can overdo it though. You can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system. Elite athletes are more prone to infections. So don#t overdo it. As ever, moderation is the key.Stay calmOne of the many effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can decrease immune , a common example of which is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. During periods of stress, it can reactivate again and you get shingles. And we all know that stress makes us more susceptible to colds and flus. Worrying about Covid- might actually make you more susceptible to it.What about alcohol Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis though, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. This is one reason why alcoholics are more prone to infections. So the hot whiskey might make you feel better for a short time but it might also slow down recovery.Sleep wellExercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to infection. A study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of immune cells. If you#ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything#s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you#ve got problems.So the bottom line is a good night#s sleep, combating stress, a balanced diet, and moderate exercise are all great at boosting your immune system, in the never-ending battle between us and the germs that infect us, and that includes the latest bundle of evil, SARS-CoV.

Until the last couple of days there was a real fear that the two dferent approaches could not sit side-by-side on the island. It#s encouraging to see a more consistent approach starting to develop, but every day Northern Ireland waits is a day lost.There needs to be social distancing, there needs to be an end to mass gatherings and we#re staring to see that. The key in the Republic of Ireland is that the community has bought in to the concept. Northern Ireland needs to buy in to it, too. That simply can#t stop when you reach the border. Every day Northern Ireland does not work as a whole to fight this is a day wasted.We can#t afford to let this virus get a hold on a region. If it does we see the number of cases double within - hours. If there are  cases in Northern Ireland on Tuesday, by Thursday that#s , by Saturday that#s . Then the numbers start to become frightening. Korea and China put strict measures in place. Then there has been a two-week period of cases multiplying, but after the two weeks the number of cases starts to slow.But what we have to do is make sure there are not too many cases already by the time the measures are implemented.Every day of inaction, the virus is winning. The time for sitting by and letting others make decisions for us has passed. If we wait too long and allow the virus to overrun us, people will die needlessly, warned Dr Mallon.There#s no scaremongering going on. I#ve been in the game for  years. I#ve got colleagues who have been working in infectious diseases for  years. No one has seen anything like this.When we look at what#s happening within China, Italy, these are countries which have a really good set-up, really good specialists, really good hospitals and despite all of that they#re train crashes.The worst case scenario is that we#re going to get thousands of people dying from this infection, that the healthcare system becomes so overwhelmed that evenwe could have saved some of these people, the capacity to save isn#t there.The message to --year-olds is look around your family, look around the older people in your family and say to yourself,I don#t get this right I might still be here in six months# time, but a few of them might not be. That#s the grim reality.For a vaccine, we#re looking at  months. Our only answer right now is non-pharmaceutical intervention.

Tens of thousands more people have flocked to pharmacies on a daily basis as the Covid- crisis has deepened, he added.We would like to remind the public that community pharmacists are frontline health workers who must be protected from getting sick so they can continue to deliver a service to those who need it. As a result, we will be changing how we work in community pharmacies and would ask for public support to manage this. There will be signicantly reduced access to pharmacies. Access will be restricted to keep low numbers inside pharmacies. New counters are also being put in place to help manage social distancing requirements. Please be patient with these changes and work with us.In addition, patients should be flexible and allow pharmacies up to  hours to get repeat medicines ready for collection once forms are handed into the pharmacy. Again, please be patient with these changes.Mr Greene asked for calm from the public and said pharmacists were focused on helping the sick. Please be mindful that we need pharmacy teams to remain well so the service remains in place, he said.Pharmacists will ensure everyone gets their medicines and that supplies are managed safely.

First Minister Arlene Foster has called for funding from Westminster to deliver support. We#re very concerned about small businesses across a number of sectors, she said, highlighting the tourism and hospitality industry. There are many sectors we will try and support but we will need to get funding from Westminster to try and deliver that support.Stormont has announced it will introduce new measures including rates relief for businesses, continuing free school mealsschools close and support for the elderly and homeless.If you rely on benefits or are struggling financially due to the coronavirus, here#s what has already been announced to help you. Q How can I sign on for benefits during the pandemic A Communities minister Deirdre Hargey has announced that all benefits offices will be closed and contact will be made over the phone to protect the public and frontline staff. All front line services will be suspended initially for a period of three months to assess where we are with this virus and any contact will be done via the telephone or other forms of communications, she said, speaking on BBC Radio Ulster. Appointments have been postponed for a period of three months, which may be extended. Q Do I still have to sign on in person A Ms Hargey said that those who normally have to sign on in person for benefits will no longer have to turn up to the benefit offices. No one will be penalised for any attending the office, she said, adding that those who usually have to submit medical advice or certicates in person are not currently required to do so. Q Will I be contacted about my face-to-face interview A We#re contacting those people over the next few days to let them know their appointments have been suspended initially for a period of three months. We will be constantly reviewing that, said Ms Hargey.  Q Is there any other support available A The Communities Minister said she will address discretionary support payment legislation over the next few days. These are payments for those who are on a wage from April  of under £,, low income families who are fallen on hard times - that they can come and apply for a grant for things like household costs, food bills, heating costs, she said. Ms Hargey said she is also moving on issues such as statutory sick pay and universal credit. Those workers who happen to lose their jobs here who are on contracts or who are self-employed can now come forward to claim those benefits and get that additional support, she said. Q I am on the Steps  Success employment programme - do I have to attend A Ms Hargey said: All programmes going forward will be suspended for a period and people will not be penalised for not attending the office.Q I am a business owner - will I receive any relief from the Executive A Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the executive was working on a stimulus package to help the business sector, which will include measures on business rates, the property taxes paid by companies.She has also directly requested funds to help businesses. It#s after the tourism industry warned on Monday , tourism businesses might not survive without immediate help.Ministers have said they will meet to discuss budget allocations and redirect resources toward the rapid response effort.Q I work in a small business - what will my job prospects look like in the near future A Speaking in Stormont on Monday, Mrs Dodds revealed plans to re-ert laid-off staff in the coming months.I think it is something that my department will quickly look at,we are in the position where firms have to close, she said. Many people will have skills in food preparation that we may need in our hospitals and so on as this thing reaches a peak, so we will be looking at this and how,one business closes, there are opportunities in other areas.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus fact check: From masks to mortality rates - how to separate fact from fictionThe coronavirus crisis has become a breeding ground for myths and conspiracies - how do we separate fact from fiction \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ab .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cdcd-b--ab-dccefd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHow former army trauma surgeon Michael Ryan from Ireland is leading global fight against coronavirusDr Michael Ryan was at home in his kitchen in Galway one day, and his phone rang, the caller identied himself as Bill Gates.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTyrone man who openly admitted beating his children jailedNorthern Ireland civil servant to face Crown Court over indecent imagesRHI Inquiry Report: The heat is off Arlene Foster as she escapes criticismBelfast firm#s innovative thermometer creates global rush for orders during coronavirus crisisSparq to be production provider at spectacular awards ceremony ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Any module changes whether in terms of content, assessment or delivery will be communicated to students as soon as possible. “If the delivery of a module or the content contained in an assessment are affected by the move online, this will be taken into account, where appropriate, when the work is marked.”  International Student Community “We are also very aware of the particular dficulties being faced by our international student community here at Ulster and the growing level of concern over access to international flights and the continuation of studies. “With this in mind, we wish to advise that international students who feel the need tohome should feel free do so.

Hopefully it’s foolproof, but everyone’s dialect would be dferent.”“I’d love to do another one for a Key Stage  reading scheme. What we want to do is provide it to areas that want it. There were only , books printed, so we’re tied a bit in that regard.”Gloacuter na Speiriacuteniacute had mooted the idea a few years previously but were unable to proceed as they weren’t able to secure the funding. Conchuacuter thinks the revamped scheme will encourage parents to get involved in their child’s reading and take away any reluctance that may exist.He said: “We put phonetics underneath the Irish transcript so a person who has now Irish at all can read to their children at night. “It’s a way of supporting the child and feeling part of their education and that was basically the idea behind it.“It’s giving parents a bit of encouragement to read to their child and raise their interest in reading. “They might be timid at the start but by the time they get through all nine books they’ll be flying at the end of it!”With children experiencing increased amounts of screen time, Conchuacuter hopes engaging parents in reading to their children will help them wind down at night and strengthen the parental bond.He said: “I think it will have a positive impact because when you look at the way technology is advancing, a lot of children are going to bed with phones and iPads.“Their brains are active all the time with these devices.“This way, you can put all that technology away for a while and the parent can go in and read to their child at night.“It’s bound to have a positive impact, not alone on the child but also in strengthening the bond between parent and child.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

And meant it. Surely big Ron Atkinson put it best when he offered: “I never comment on referees and I’m not going to break the habit of a letime for that prat.”The men in black - universally castigated for their myopia, shunned for poor decision-making, and all too often the painted the perennial pantomime villains. Undeniably society’s last great unprotected minority, perhaps it’s time to redress the balance, to pay tribute to the unloved whistler.Storm Dennis, Storm Ciara and their exotic cousin Storm Jorge – that unholy Trinity of recent unwelcome weather phenomena, wreaked havoc on the recent sporting scene, and threatened to carpet bomb the entire sporting calendar.But across this great sports loving city, from Judges Road to Celtic Park our bold referees collectively drew back the curtains on teeth-chatteringly cold weekends. The show must go on, and the much maligned referees were the benevolent ringmasters. googletag.cmd.push MotivationLocal football referee Dennis O’Connor paints a picture of what would motivate an apparently sane looking man to take up this God-forsaken hobby.“It’s addictive,” enthuses O’Connor. “When you first start you can’t get enough of it!“I’ve always enjoyed refereeing Saturday mornings. It’s more local and I enjoy meeting the players. You run into them up the town and you talk about the game, have a laugh. It’s a social thing really.”Originally from Kent, the love of a local woman brought him to these shores in  where he played for BBOB and Foyle Wanderers.And like all sportsmen, father time eventually tapped his wicked finger on the shoulder and the time arrived for O’Connor to call it a day.“I wasn’t enjoying football anymore you worry about injuries as you get older. And I thought I’ll give refereeing a go.“The first game I reffed was a DuPont game and I loved it straight away,” says the Englishman with a straight face. “I don’t know what it is but I’ve always loved the Saturday Morning League. You really look forward to the weekend.”Boasting six dferent referee kits these days, the modern refereeing wardrobe is as colourful as some of the language O’Connor would endure at a Tamnaherin Celtic match. While watching games on television is very much a bus man’s holiday for the affable  year old whistler. “You’re watching the referee all the time you’re even watching the linesman. I find myself calling ‘Offside!’ during games like a lunatic.” googletag.cmd.push PreferenceGreysteel man Sean Curran officiates all codes in GAA and soccer, but has a strong preference. “I love Gaelic games,” he states. “I find the soccer to be a bit boring to be honest. Underage soccer is better because of the level of skill these days, it’s a joy to referee. But definitely Gaelic Games is my first choice.”Do referees need a thick skin  “Very! You have to be a certain type of person. You have to be strong mentally. You have to be able to deflect all the flack you can get.”  PICTURED: Local referee John Crossan. The  year old shares Dennis O’Connor’s passion for the officiating trade. “I love it,” he says. “It’s a passion I have. I started out just doing it for my club but then I wanted to do bigger and bigger games. And I wanted to improve my own standards. I’ve refereed over  matches now and I’ve enjoyed every one of them.”Hurling referee Mark O’Neill agrees with Curran that a hide like a rhinosaurus is crucial to succeed in the refereeing game.“%!” he laughs. “Look, I gave it to referees all my le. I argued with referees over most decisions, and I suppose this is now karma coming back at me. As a referee you have to take the higher ground. In the first five seconds after an incident you have to give the player a bit of time to digest a decision he or she may strongly agree with.“In GAA you can move the ball on  metres. You don’t have that in soccer. I find that really helps in GAA, as it turns it back on the player where their team-mates turn on themthe ball is moved forward.“Rugby has the same idea,” he continues, “but the respect rugby referees get is amazing. There’s nothing worse than slabbering, and the sin bingives the person ten minutes to simmer down.” ContrastingRugby referee Glenda Mellon cuts a very much contrasting figure on a Saturday afternoon. “I started  years ago after I stopped playing and coaching,” she explains. “It gave me a way of being involved in the sport I love without the bruises and pain on a Monday morning.”Finishing up her own stellar rugby career, Waterside woman faced the same dilemma as many of her refereeing compatriots. What next   PICTURED:Rugby referee Glenda Mellon “I really enjoy it as it gives me something to train for,” says the youthful  year old. “Its also competitiveyou want it to be. You want to improve your assessment scores and get moved up the levels to get better games.”But refereeing can prove to be a dficult balancing act too for the family woman. “The worst thing is the mummy we guilt of being away all day Saturday.“I enjoy the games most when the players have a bit of banter with me,” she continues. “But its usually quite funny when players forget whos reffing and call me ‘Sir’ during a game, and then get very embarrassed when they realise what they have said.”‘Fail to prepare, prepare to fail’ quoth the great Roy Keane, but he probably hadn’t anticipating this answer from Glenda Mellon on how she readies herself for a rugby match.“Fake tan, eyelashes and French plaits!” she chortles. Fair to say not the typical response you would hear from a referee, but a welcome addition in le’s rich tapestry.  PICTURED:Referee Mark McGarrigle gives a yellow card to Sion Mills player. As a potential hobby refereeing might appear as soul destroying as checking your bank balance after a big weekend. Apart from all the grief you endure from players and spectators alike, there’s not much glamour in changing your clothes in a small cattle shed, or in the back of a lorry container in Donemana – where a shower with warm water a dim and distant prospect.A sunken soggy pitch at Leafair, or a bracingly cold morning at Lisnagelvin where the wind would blow a traveller off his cousin – only the lion-hearted need apply to the reffing trade.It’s not for everyone. But to the small minority who take up the whistle, and remember we couldn’t play or watch sport without them, referees are an integral part of the game and we should salute them. And just like footballers, hurlers and rugby players across the country, the misery of a poor game can follow them around like a mangy dog.Playing the game tends to be a selfish act. ‘Love’, ‘passion’, ‘give something back’. These are the collective themes that knit together and resonate when you speak to referees about their motivations.Somebody once said being a rare boy is not a crime. Well neither is being a referee.  PICTURED:Former Derry City and Celtic star Niall McGinn with local referees, Marty Dunne, Dick Tucker and on right, Gerry Morrison.

Organisers of the race said they had made the decision because of the ongoing outbreak of Covid-. The races stopover in Derry was to be the centrepiece of the week-long Foyle Maritime Festival. If the race has been postponed, it seems unlikely that the festival will go ahead - another massive blow to the local economy as the impact of the coronavirus continues to hit all aspects of le. In a statement this morning, organisers of the Clipper Race said it was a very dficult decision. googletag.cmd.push With the ongoing global outbreak of Covid- and the enormous impact it has created on world travel, the Clipper - Race has been postponed with immediate effect. This decision has been in no way taken lightly. Our crew are currently under quarantine in Subic Bay, Philippines, where the Clipper Race fleet has been berthed since Sunday  March. The island of Luzonis currently under enhanced community quarantine. In addition, the fleet was due to race across the North Pacic Ocean from  March towards Seattle. However, with the city currently in a state of emergency and travel and medical insurance restrictions in the United States, we could not allow our teams to depart without a viable destination. googletag.cmd.push This, along with the growing global uncertainty on how the situation could develop in the coming months, meant postponing the race was the safest option for all involved. The organisers said theClipper - Race has three legs remaining. These race stages will now be postponed for approximately ten months, when the remaining circumnavigation will be completed. Thisof postponement allows for us to avoid adverse weather patterns on the remainder of our global route. All Leg ,  and  crew, along with our circumnavigators, will be able to rejoin the race when it resumes next year. This postponement will have an impact on the timing of future races. The next full edition of the Clipper Race will start in the summer of . More details on this will be confirmed at a later date. We are extremely disappointed to postpone the remainder of the Clipper - Race. We are proud of all of our intrepid crew for having competed in this race edition since it departed London and look forward to welcoming all of our upcoming crew next year when the race continues. We are also grateful to all of our crew, supporters and Race Partners for their continued support.

Organisers of the race said they had made the decision because of the ongoing outbreak of Covid-. The races stopover in Derry was to be the centrepiece of the week-long Foyle Maritime Festival. If the race has been postponed, it seems unlikely that the festival will go ahead - another massive blow to the local economy as the impact of the coronavirus continues to hit all aspects of le. In a statement this morning, organisers of the Clipper Race said it was a very dficult decision. googletag.cmd.push With the ongoing global outbreak of Covid- and the enormous impact it has created on world travel, the Clipper - Race has been postponed with immediate effect. This decision has been in no way taken lightly. Our crew are currently under quarantine in Subic Bay, Philippines, where the Clipper Race fleet has been berthed since Sunday  March. The island of Luzonis currently under enhanced community quarantine. In addition, the fleet was due to race across the North Pacic Ocean from  March towards Seattle. However, with the city currently in a state of emergency and travel and medical insurance restrictions in the United States, we could not allow our teams to depart without a viable destination. googletag.cmd.push This, along with the growing global uncertainty on how the situation could develop in the coming months, meant postponing the race was the safest option for all involved. The organisers said theClipper - Race has three legs remaining. These race stages will now be postponed for approximately ten months, when the remaining circumnavigation will be completed. Thisof postponement allows for us to avoid adverse weather patterns on the remainder of our global route. All Leg ,  and  crew, along with our circumnavigators, will be able to rejoin the race when it resumes next year. This postponement will have an impact on the timing of future races. The next full edition of the Clipper Race will start in the summer of . More details on this will be confirmed at a later date. We are extremely disappointed to postpone the remainder of the Clipper - Race. We are proud of all of our intrepid crew for having competed in this race edition since it departed London and look forward to welcoming all of our upcoming crew next year when the race continues. We are also grateful to all of our crew, supporters and Race Partners for their continued support.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy. One of her finely embroidered pieces hangs proudly in the nursesrsquo station at Spa Nursing Home.Some years ago, Jean visited northern France and sewed the magnicent medieval monastery of Mont-St-Michel, set in the bay of St Malo where Normandy and Brittany merge.She is also a keen local historian and is particularly knowledgable about Betsy Gray and the Battle of Ballynahinch in .Jean also enjoys John Wayne films, including Rio Bravo and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and the musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers which starred Howard Keel.

It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","title":"Coronavirus: St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEXT Tuesdayrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick has been cancelled over the coronavirus threat.Itrsquos only the second time the cross-community carnival has been halted since it was started in the s mdash it was called off in  due to the foot and mouth health crisis.Newry, Mourne and Down Council yesterday confirmed that parades would not go ahead in Downpatrick or Newry after party leaders on the council decided to pull the plug.The council has also cancelled open-air activities in St Patrickrsquos Square, but other events in Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre are going ahead.Chief executive Marie Ward spoke yesterday morning with the DUPrsquos Billy Walker, Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke, UUPrsquos David Taylor and the SDLPrsquos Pete Byrne for their views after Belfast City Council voted to cancel its parade on Monday night.Dublin also cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, the largest event held on the island.A council spokesperson said the decision was made ldquoin consultation with party leaders and is in line with the recent cancellations of St Patrickrsquos Day parades where.The spokesperson added: ldquoThe council appreciates the negative impact this decision may have on local businesses at this time, however this decision has been taken as a precaution given our membersrsquo and the publicrsquos concern around the coronavirus response.The townrsquos religious ceremonies are to go ahead as planned.A service of Holy Communion in St Patrickrsquos Church of Ireland Church at Saul will be held at .am.The traditional mass in Irish and the distribution of shamrock will take place in St Patrickrsquos Church at am and the cross-community service will take place in Down Cathedral at .am.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said while he understood peoplersquos concerns, he pointed out that Patrickrsquos Day was also a religious festival and that services would be taking place as normal.ldquoPart of our theme this year is prayer for the country which is very apt at this time, he added.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke was the first politician to call for the event to be cancelled.The Sinn Feacutein man said it was ldquoessential to have an all Ireland response to this epidemic, which is spreading rapidly across Europe.He said: ldquoI believe there is an obligation on myself and all councillors to protect the health and well-being of citizens, given the spread of coronavirus and growing concern amongst the public.He said that the decision was not taken lightly but it was ldquothe responsible thing to do.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an event held at a later dateit is possible, to reschedule these celebrations, as sections of the business community will undoubtedly see a reduction in business, and the British government need to provide resources to mitigate these losses.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said he felt that there would have been an increased risk to Downpatrickthe parade had have gone ahead as it could have attracted people who normally attended the Belfast event.ldquoWe may have had the situation that we would have increased crowds with increased risk, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI think itrsquos the right decision to take. I completely sympathise with all the council officials and employees who have planned the event, and of course all the community groups who love to take part and who have put in months of hard work with float and costume preparation.ldquoBut at the end of the day we have to think of health and public safety.Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews, of the SDLP, said he fully supported the decision but added ldquothat it was most unfortunate it had to be taken.ldquoCouncillors have done the right thing and itrsquos better to be cautious to minimise any potential risks, he said.South Down MP Chris Hazzard praised the council for its ldquoproactive and responsible leadership to protect our citizens in cancelling the parade.He added: ldquoThere will of course be huge public disappointment and hard-felt financial repercussions for our local retail and hospitality industry. But the health and well-being of our citizens must be the priority for all of us.One of the first associated casualties of the cancelled parade is Downpatrick and County Down Railwayrsquos planned park-and-ride service from Inch Abby to the town centre.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said he estimated the not-for profit organisation would lose between pound,-pound, in income as a result.ldquoIf therersquos no carnival, therersquos no need for the park and ride, confirmed Mr Gardiner. ldquoWe normally carry about - people into Downpatrick on the day and they nearly all go to the carnival.ldquoWhile we can take this loss of income on the chin at the moment, we would be worriedthis continues as Easter is a very good holiday for us and we enjoyed a very busy summer last year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar hosts meeting on future of unionism  ","story":"THE first in a series of meetings to discuss the future of unionism in Rowallane was held last week in Crossgar.Guests included Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Orange Order Grand Secretary the Rev Mervyn Gibson and victimsrsquo campaigner Sammy Heenan.Organised by Rowallane councillors Kathryn Owen and Billy Walker, Crossgar Orange Order members and Crossgar Young Defenders Flute Band, last weekrsquos meeting has been hailed a great success.Around  people attended the meeting at Crossgar Orange Hall with plans confirmed for another in Saintfield over the coming weeks.Organisers say that they believe that local unionism is in a ldquomuch stronger place following the meeting with organisers thanking all those who took part.Also attending last weekrsquos meeting was Mr John Hanna, chairman of the UUPrsquos Strangfordrsquos Association.Cllr Owen said people spoke ldquoopenly and honestly during the meeting, with concerns voiced by those who attended ldquolistened to and discussed.She admitted while there is work to do across Northern Ireland, she is confident that unionism in Rowallane has taken a step in the right direction.Cllr Walker mdash who described the meeting as ldquoextremely worthwhile mdash thanked everyone who supported the event and encouraged people to attend the next one in Rowallane when the date and venue have been confirmed.ldquoThe turnout was tremendous and there was a lot of rank discussion which is good.

Monday when local politicians agreed to appoint a dedicated design team to oversee major redevelopment work at the sprawling park which covers over , acres.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which is working to make the forest park one of Northern Irelandrsquos leading tourist attractions mdash has to date secured almost pound, in grant aid towards the cost of the ambitious project.The council has also committed just over poundm of its money to the project with a fresh application for pound.m to be submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund in June, with an anxious wait until September to discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was confirmed that the council currently holds a -year operating licence for the parkrsquos walking, bike and horse riding trails, in addition to play facilities.In addition, politicians were told that during a workshop in January to discuss the way forward, it was identied that formal links will be required with a number of organisations in relation to the future management of the parkrsquos Bothy Yard, glasshouses and propagation in particular.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is also hoping to secure a lease for the hugely popular park from the Forest Service and confirmed that once funding has been secured and the lease secured, it will pave the way for construction work to start.It has also been confirmed that local people will be asked for their views on the redevelopment of the forest park with public consultation on the way forward to be held sometime next month. Two previous consultation exercises have already been held.Councillors were told on Monday that the local authority may be asked to provide additional funding for the forest park development,the level of funding being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund is not secured.They also agreed to investigate the potential of developing a partnership arrangement with Annes Grove in Cork which boasts an th century house and early th century garden, the latter of which includes a woodland garden with an interesting collection of rhododendrons, river garden, walled garden, wild-flower meadow and lily pond.Council officials believe there is merit for a joint marketing exercise involving Annes Grove and the Castlewellan park, alongside the propagation of trees and shrubs and student exchanges.Also on Monday, councillors granted permission for local authority officials to develop expressions of interest in vacant space at the forest park and hope that work to make one of the nest even better can get underway within months.Council officials say while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve them and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.It is envisaged that initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the critically acclaimed arboretum,

ends Strangford cup dream  ","story":"THERE was to be no fairytale cup ending for Strangford when Ballynagross ruled the roost in Friday nightrsquos NFU Mutual Harry Clarke Cup semi-final at Bignian Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

The winner is trained at the ownerrsquos estate by Colin McKeever and was ridden by Ballymenarsquos Paddy McGuigan for his second success.

I was one of the eighteen and a half million people watching on TV after midnight as Dennis Taylor from Coalisland recovered from a seemingly impossible deficit to beat the machine-like Steve Davis on the final black.Less than three weeks later Manchester United faced Everton in football’s FA Cup final on a sunny Saturday at Wembley. Everton were the strong favourites having easily won the league title that season. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The odds against United were stacked even steeper when defender Kevin Moran became the first player ever to be sent off in the cup final.The match was goalless in extra time when Norman Whiteside from the Shankill Road went on a solo run before curling a low shot past Everton keeper Neville Southall to win the fabled trophy for United.Three weeks after that Barry McGuigan, from the border village of Clones, was challenging the legendary Eusebio Pedroza for the featherweight boxing world title at Loftus Road in London.My da and uncle attended the fight. For a young boy from north Antrim who had never been off this island, their expedition could not have been any more exotic thanmy da had told me they were going on safari to Saturn’s rings and were stopping off for some sightseeing at the Great Red Spot of Jupiter on the way home.While my da experienced the fevered atmosphere in the ground, I watched on television on a stirring night as the seemingly inexhaustible McGuigan battered the grand old champion around the ring for  rounds to rip the world title from his grasp.In his corner that night was Barney Eastwood. At the time I knew Eastwood only as McGuigan’s manager and the man whose bald head was always protruding into the corner of the camera shot while Barry was being interviewed in the ring after his fights.Now I have a better understanding of how boxing is as much a business as a sport and an appreciation of the scale of Eastwood’s achievement in establishing Belfast as a base for the trade, and also for how he tempted the wily Pedroza to London to risk defending his title on alien soil in front of a raucously partisan crowd.I was planning to write that these memories were rekindled in my memory following the death of the veteran businessman and promoter last week but that’s not quite accurate. The truth is that Barry’s glory night, just like Whiteside’s goal and Taylor’s triumph are never very far from my mind and require no prompt.More than that, the images and emotions are seared into my consciousness, photographs that will never fade or turn sepia.Dennis Taylor shaking his cue and wagging his finger in delight after stunning Davis. Norman Whiteside, with the number  on the back of his stained jersey, running with his arms aloft to salute the crowd after his wonder goal. I still know the words from United’s  FA Cup final song.And the fight. Pedroza’s imposing moustache and sideburns. Barry’s father singing ‘Danny Boy’ in the ring. Commentator Harry Carpenter in the seventh bemoaning the fact that ‘McGuigan’s work has been less effective in this round’ just one second before the Clones Cyclone exploded a devastating straight right which felled the Panamanian champion.The older I get the more trouble I have retaining information, but the paint will always remain wet and brilliant on those great canvases.The common thread is obvious, three tales of local boys who overcame the odds to become masters on the international stage. Proving a point to an awed -year-old that where you come from does not have to be a barrier to what you can achieve, that the destination is more important than the starting point.But the real point is, I think, deeper, more profound. It’s the capturing and crystallisation of a precious stage of development of a child. Old enough to understand, but still young enough to have a sense of wonder.There was the guilty excitement of being able to sit up late to watch the snooker even though I had school the next morning. The bragging rights in the playground that my team had won the cup.The countless hours trying to recreate the goal in the field behind our house or potting balls on our miniature snooker table.And the fight. That Christmas I asked Santa to bring me boxing gloves and a punchbag. I wore those little red gloves out trying to convince myself that I could be like Barry McGuigan.Those three occasions have never left me, and few things have marked me in the same way since.Of course, local people had succeeded at world level before , and have continued to do so afterwards. But nothing ever seems as important as it did when you are . The world never again stopped like it did then.The years have wound on. Sometimes though, I’m still able to think like a child. It comes most often late at night when my brain is tired and unable to process coherent thoughts. Then, with my eyes closed in the dark the images of Taylor’s black ball finish or Whiteside’s goal are there.And the fight. The plan devised by Barney and executed by Barry. Sometimes the noise of the crowd is the last thing in my mind before I sleep, with my da somewhere in that throng, singing ‘Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

Half an hour later, Ms O’Neill again released her own statement, calling for schools to be shut immediately and attacking the British approach.When dealing with matters of such gravity – and when well-intentioned experts are not all in agreement about the best way to save lives – it is understandable that there are disagreements.But just two months after the New Decade, New Approach deal set out how its new Party Leaders’ Forum was meant to“operate as a safe space for party leaders to discuss ... any issues which might cause future political tension and disagreements”, it is clear that this Executive is critically ided along orange and green lines – and at the worst possible time.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March . Parents and carers can visit the school at am, pm, and .pm.

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.
