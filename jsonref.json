The further two episodes will look at the Greek financial meltdown and the Syrian migrant crisis. Craig Oliver, Mr Cameron\u0027s ex spin doctor, said: \u0027This is completely wrong.\u0027David Cameron spent the whole of the 2015 election campaign making clear he would not lead any form of Government that didn’t have a referendum. \u0027Look at almost any interview he did.

Philip, driving a Land Rover Freelander, drove out from a side road into a busy main road and collided with a Kia carrying two women and a nine-month-old babyHer friend, the driver, suffered minor injuries, and the baby, thankfully was unhurt.Philip, miraculously given he is 97 years old and his Land Rover rolled over onto its side, was also unhurt.He has reportedly blamed bright sunshine for temporarily blinding him, so he was unable to see the Kia coming when he pulled out into its path.Other witnesses have suggested it was a cloudy day, and the more likely explanation is his old age impaired his ability to drive.Frankly, I don’t believe ANY 97-year-old should be allowed to drive a car – especially if they have a whole array of servants and bodyguards who can do it for them.But that’s not what bothered me most about this story.No, what ENRAGED me is what happened next.The very next day, a new Land Rover was ostentatiously delivered to Philip in full view of the media.And within just a few hours he was driving it around public roads without wearing a seatbelt - an illegal act.The pictures showed a defiant Philip snarling at the wheel.His message was clear: ‘You won’t stop me driving, I’m rich enough to get a new car whenever I like, and I don’t care about obeying the law of the land.’          Emma Fairweather, the passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist. Her nine-month-old baby was in the back seat And frankly, he made me sick to my stomach.What astonishing arrogance!And how staggeringly insensitive to the people whose car he smashed into only hours earlier!Just imagine the outrage that would have erupted if a famous footballer like David Beckham had behaved like this?He’d have rightly been crucified both in the press, and in the court of public opinion.He’d have also faced almost certain prosecution.Yet Philip, we’re told, has been given just a friendly warning by police.To make matters worse, he hasn’t even bothered to contact the people he hit. Instead, an aide for his wife, the Queen, left a voicemail message saying they were ‘thinking of you very much’.Really?It doesn’t seem to me that Philip has been thinking of anyone but himself, in the most selfish, aloof and inconsiderate possible manner.I’m a big fan of the royals I think they do a huge amount of good for Britain, and our image around the world, that fully justifies – and repays - the vast amount of tax-payer money we spend on them.I also think, notwithstanding his extreme aversion to media people like me, that Prince Philip is an extraordinary man who has devoted most of his life to serving his country superbly well in myriad ways.He certainly fully deserves his recent long-overdue retirement from public life.But he needs to understand this incident has shown him at his privileged worst, and reflects badly on all the royals.The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt.To be so openly, flagrantly contemptuous of public opinion, members of the public, and the law of the land is completely unacceptable – especially if you’re the husband of the Queen.Where is his contrition, or common courtesy?    The bottom line is he nearly killed three of Her Majesty’s subjects with his reckless driving, then compounded his victims’ distress by refusing to apologise to them, and getting straight back on the road in a new car, with no seatbelt Philip, as I know to my cost, won’t care what I have to say about his conduct.And he won’t care what the rest of the media thinks either.Nor, it is sadly obvious, does he seem to care about the on-going condition and feelings of the people he careered into.It’s equally apparent he is refusing to listen to a word any of his protection officers are saying to him – because they would have surely begged him not to go back out driving on his own on public roads so soon after an accident, without even belting up.No, there’s only one person in the world who Philip ever listens to and that’s his wife.So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.For his sake, and ours.          So I respectfully suggest Her Majesty now has a very firm word in the Duke of Hazard’s cantankerous, belligerent ear, tells him to stop being such a stubborn callous fool, and orders him to give up driving.

Why do people love him so much? Pierre Bonnard in the bathroom mirror holding up his hand like a boxer, though really he is clutching a wet sponge. Bonnard on film, in a snatch of home movie, blinking incessantly behind his little round glasses. Bonnard in the kitchen (I’m sure the housekeeper would rather he went away) and out on the terrace. Bonnard hovering here and there Bonnard beside the tub, as his wife takes yet another bath.I am ambivalent about Bonnard. The things I admire and that interest me in his paintings are not perhaps the things he fully intended. Aspects of his work that others find charming or life-affirming I soon weary of. All that colour, all that fidgety brushwork. His figures are very hit-and-miss, sometimes crude and absurd sometimes the distortions seem terrific, at other times horrible. I can’t bear the way one naked female leg is always warm, the other always cool, and why Bonnard teases the viewer with one female nipple always being in stark profile. He can be monumental, he can be scrappy. Faces in the crowd are often monstrous or ill-formed. Bonnard did not have a facile talent: he had to work at things. There is a great deal of niggling about, and piling paint on. I think he found landscape easier, a relief from the tensions of the human subject.At the artist’s last retrospective, the critic David Sylvester told me that if I didn’t get Bonnard, I didn’t get painting. I suppose he might have been right, and his remark may have had something to do with why I am no longer a painter, but I doubt it. Bonnard kept on painting through the long procession of days and seasons and years and wars and time without suspense. I have an image of him moping and lurking about the place, going in and out of the studio to add a touch here and another touch there between breakfast and lunch. Bonnard’s paintings are full of complications, equivocations and repeated attempts at resolution. His best paintings do seem to accrue a kind of incremental silence. I hear the sound of dripping taps, a metronome of ennui. Just maybe, this is exactly what Bonnard is trying to capture.Plenty of people really love Bonnard. I like that painting where two women are bending to fuss over the dog, but all you can see of the creature is its nose and snout poking up over the cloth on the far side of the kitchen table. Judging by other dogs he painted, this was a good way of not having to deal with the whole canine. But Bonnard was good at uncomfortable human proximity, and also at cropping figures, though I think he could have made more of this, and added to what psychological drama (the unseen, the glimpsed, the idea that the viewer is a kind of furtive interloper) that his pictures do contain. A 1935 Nude in An Interior stands in a doorway, raising her hand to her head. We glimpse only a vertical sliver of her, one foot, one knee, one hip, one breast, one arm and less than half her head. You almost expect her to slam the door as we pass by. I am beginning to feel like a house guest who has only just got the hint that they’ve outstayed their welcome.In a much earlier work from 1900, a naked man and woman in a frowzy bedroom are separated by a folded screen that ides the image down the centre, as though by a cinematic split screen. She is on one side, absorbed by the two cats on the bed, he on the other, towelling himself down, and partly cropped by the edge of the canvas. You wonder what he is thinking. You can imagine all kinds of stories. Is it me, or is it somehow very claustrophobic in here?Mostly, Bonnard painted his companion since 1893, Marthe de Méligny, though sometimes his model and, later, lover Renée Monchaty. In 1921, Bonnard went to Rome with Monchaty. It seems he was as indecisive in love as he was in painting. In 1925, Bonnard and de Méligny finally married, and three weeks later, Monchaty killed herself.I like the way cups and bowls and jugs are so often tilted towards us on the picture plane to reveal their insides and what they contain – as if to say: “Nothing to hide here” – showing us that there are no secrets. But there always are secrets in any domestic scene, things kept from us, things kept from each other. These are not Walter Sickert’s Camden Town Murder paintings, or scenes from the everyday lives of the Bovary household, or of Patricia Highsmith’s Mr and Mrs Ripley, at home among the soft furnishings with the body bleeding on the wine cellar floor. If there had been, Bonnard would have painted the stain in at least three types of crimson, as he tried to capture the memory.Blossom bursts, the foliage is variegated, light strikes the kitchen door, the figs in the bowl are ripe, the bathroom is quiet, the views are always marvellous, and Madame continues with her hydrotherapy. No wonder Bonnard looks shifty in his self-portraits in the bathroom mirror. I feel uneasy, too, about the man in the mirror. The exhibition takes us from 1900 to Bonnard’s death in 1947, and it feels as if we have been here all that time. Tate wants us to slow down to really look, absorbing the colour, the light, the atmosphere. Everything was absolutely lovely. I couldn’t wait to get away.• Pierre Bonnard: The Colour of Memory is at Tate Modern, London, 23 January – 6 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f801e3bc94841285c8235258f5e2831fa05d05a9/17_201_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad42fd6539815a79f51208fffc323b4a","title":"bauhaus at 100 its legacy in five key designs","story":"The aesthetic of the German art school has influenced everything from typography at airports to iPhones.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.ID3334123 recommends the Beastie Boys Book by Mike D and Ad Rock:By turns joyful, hilarious and moving, often all three at once. Utterly life-affirming in its grin-inducing energy.A Month In The Country by JL Carr has provided similar sustenance for roadwaterlady:Such a delight to read –\u0026nbsplike the first mouthful of freshly baked cake, still slightly warm and fruity, quietly infusing one with peaceful acceptance, for as Tom finds his way so do we.This week I started the last volume, Le temps retrouvé … Sad that this adventure will soon end but immensely happy that there is more Proust to read and that I can start the Recherche any time again when I feel like it. It’s THE book for me, profound, witty, elegant, intriguing, beautifully written and all in all it is just a great pleasure to spend time with Proust’s extraordinary and sharply observant narrator. What a writer!ChronicExpat is also enjoying a classic, JG Farrell’s The Siege of Krishnapur:Progress is slow as I am frequently distracted by current politics on both sides of the Atlantic...although I’m finding the book quite a good corrective for that. So many of the characters see themselves as riding the cutting edge of progressive (circa 1857) thought, and Farrell so brilliantly inhabits the Victorian mindset, that it leaves me wondering how we with our own certainties will strike future readers (assuming, of course, that there will be a future where readers continue to exist, and that they have any interest in their self-destructive forebears). It also encourages me to remind myself that my own philosophicalpolitical positions may not turn out to be quite so correct as I like to think they are.On the subject of politics, Peter de Bont has found Barbara Tuchman’s The March of Folly “a revelation”:Essential reading for our times. It presents four historical cases of political calamity due to a combination of ideological insularity, wrong premises based on false presumptions, seriously cross-wired communication and inidual shortcomings. She opens with an eye-opening essay on lack of rationality, or even simple common sense, as oft-recurring factor in formulating and executing government policy of potentially sweeping consequence – starting with Troy and the famous Trojan horse, by way of object lesson connecting all the six Renaissance popes systemically ignoring persistent clamour for church reform, ultimately leading to the Reformation George III’s boneheaded inanity bringing England crushing military defeat in the American War of Independence, as well as severe economic loss and, finally America’s self-betrayal in Vietnam.Joseph Heller’s Catch 22 is another “good book to read in these times of collective insanity,” according to ShouldBeEven, who has been intending to read the book for “over twenty years”:I picked up a second copy for three quid from Fopp just before Christmas and it was worth the wait. The final 200 pages are incredible. Yossarian’s Christ-like night walk through Rome stands out in this blackest of comedies.Krestinsky says that Heller’s Something Happens may be “even better”:It’s interesting in a John Cheever kind of way, although even more jaundiced and cynical.Time for some science fiction. A Far has just finished Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky:Fantastic, fun and intelligent science fiction. Themes we’ve seen before but written in a pretty unique way… I discovered it as Tom Hanks recommended it on Twitter. This is my first Hanks recommended read. So far he has an excellent recommendation success rate with me.BullRob has another good one on the go:I’ve just started Cixin Liu’s The Dark Forest having previously read and enjoyed his The Three-Body Problem. Fascinating writing from the leading Chinese author of science fiction.Amazing. Admittedly I’m not the most seasoned reader but I’ve never read anything quite like them. Fantasy that’s new and inventive. None of the tired old tropes. Refreshing to read.Elsewhere, Cardellina has enjoyed The Secret History by Donna Tartt:What a wonderful book. Six hundred plus pages of absolute indulgent pleasure (plot, writing, characters, atmosphere, everything). This time, on the third or fourth go-round, some of the small hairline fractures became clearer for me – for example, in a hypothetical “The Secret History” drinking game I would definitely add a “drink every time a character ‘raises an eyebrow’ to indicate disbelief” rule – but the writing and plotting are so confident and it’s such an entertaining firework of a book, it’s hard to care too much about issues like that.Finally, Devenish is “savouring every word” of WG Sebald’s Austerlitz:All the time there’s the heavy, slightly sinister air. There’s something so perfect about the way he writes, not a single unrequired word or comma out of place.Sebald so perfectly suits the times we live in. Like when I read JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip, there’s a sense of sadness knowing that this is it – this is the last one.We all know that sadness – but at least it also makes the books feel even more like a gift.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Even the US begins to stagger.That is the message from the International Monetary Fund, which has supplemented its usual March and October biannual health checks on the global economy with a handy interim report timed to coincide with the Davos business and political leaders’ summit.Where once the US was a V8 engine driving the global economy, now it has an equal partner on the other side of the Pacific.In a short report directed at the business leaders and “thinkers” attending the World Economic Forum, there were warnings about a no-deal Brexit and the shockwaves it would send through the global economic and financial systems. Italy was admonished for almost wilfully throwing away its recovery in a dispute with the European Union over its budget deficit.But the slowdown in the global economy over the past year and the worsening prospects for the next two years are almost entirely traced back to China and how well the Communist party leadership is handling the country’s economic affairs.Given the task at hand, there is an argument for congratulating Beijing. After it came to the rescue of the global economy in 2009 with a monster package of spending and borrowing, it has tried to bring the debts of its state enterprises under control, temper speculative property buying and restrict banks from reckless lending. All this has happened while its leaders have sought to clean up the major cities (of corruption and dirty air) and raise approximately 10 million people out of poverty each year.Unfortunately, Donald Trump’s determination to punish China for its exporting prowess could not have come at a worse time. The Communist party may have tightened its grip on economic activity and paid less heed to human rights abuses, but the capitalist genie is, to some extent, out of the bottle.The Chinese people from Shanghai to Chengdu like to speculate on property, the stock market and make money using cheap state finance and without paying too much attention to climate change.Until recently, Beijing could always turbo-charge exports and generate some extra income. With Trump’s negotiators blocking that route with tariffs (watch out Britain, the president’s trade team are difficult to please), China has seen its growth rate fall to its lowest level since 1990.The IMF boss, Christine Lagarde, was quick to downplay the potential for an imminent shock. She obviously wanted to sound more upbeat to her fellow citizens of the world, 1,500 metres up in the Swiss mountains.But she couldn’t help warning that China’s fate would determine the path for the rest of the world and that – without naming him – Trump should resolve his differences through negotiation and cooperation. Otherwise a difficult transition in China will founder, taking much of the world economy’s growth with it.As wishful thinking goes, it is hard to beat.There are delegates in Davos who breathed a sigh of relief when Trump announced that he and his delegation would not be turning up this year as planned. Time to think, they said. Especially about sharing.Lagarde, who was Nicolas Sarkozy’s right-of-centre finance minister before taking the IMF job, said on her arrival: “Solidarity is in all our self-interest.”The theme of sharing covers inequality, ersity, climate change and, at the top of the schedule on the first day, health.At Davos, the approach is mostly about the self, in line with Lagarde’s theme. So caring for someone in your community will make you more productive in your job. Opting for a career in the health industry will give job security in a world of ageing and increasingly unhealthy populations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b6d5c7b2b783bbbda1322881b35a7babc546d3b/28_269_5729_3438/master/5729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474f04d8f768c0e62ac5a4a2412acc3c","title":"patisserie valerie shareholders frustrated by lack of information","story":"Struggling cafe chain says update will be given when talks with banks concludeShareholders in Patisserie Valerie have expressed frustration at a lack of information from the cake and cafe business, which is struggling for survival as it tries to secure support from its banks.The company, which operates 200 cafes and employs nearly 3,000 staff, has been seeking to extend a standstill agreement on its bank facilities. The agreement protects the business from action to recover debts and it officially expired at midnight on Friday.Patisserie Valerie plunged into crisis in October after it admitted it had uncovered a £40m black hole in its finances. Last week it said the situation was worse than expected as it had found “significant manipulation” and its profits would be “materially below” the £12m it had predicted when the problems first emerged. Prior to the crisis it had been expected to make a £30m profit.On Monday morning the company issued a statement saying that talks with its banks were continuing and it would provide an update when they were concluded. The company’s shares have been suspended since October.Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which pumped an additional £100,000 into Patisserie Valerie as part of a £15m rescue-fundraising deal in November, said he had significantly written down the value of the company’s investment after last week’s statement.He said it would not be a “massive surprise” if the cake company had to call in administrators. “The talks going on are quite critical. It is very disturbing they are going on after the standstill has run out.“Everything is a mystery at the moment. One important thing missing is a Christmas trading statement … Everybody would get reassurance if we found the company had been trading profitably but we have heard nothing,” he said.Chris Boxall at Fundamental Asset Management, another shareholder, said he was disappointed that the company had not provided clear guidance on its debt situation or an update on trading: “This is pretty extraordinary and pretty awful.Without an agreement, the company’s lenders, HSBC and Barclays, could demand repayment of debts that may amount to nearly £10m, potentially forcing Patisserie Valerie to call in administrators.The chain has hired the advisory firm KPMG to consider “all options”, which could include a second bailout by Luke Johnson, the multimillionaire chairman of the business, a sale or administration. Johnson pumped £20m of his money into Patisserie Valerie to keep it afloat but was repaid £10m of that sum after other shareholders later put up the £15m of new funds.It has emerged that Johnson’s remaining loan is likely to be repaid ahead of other creditors if Patisserie Valerie does go into administration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7981deba93f67fbbf3d6058c8633c4cea65ab746/0_199_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e170f86ee5ee2e4fbf2ad5df23503b60","title":"pre davos survey shows sixfold rise in global ceos gloom","story":"Rising protectionism and slide in US-China ties fuel pessimism of chief executives, says PwCPessimism among chief executives has risen sharply in the past 12 months as the leaders of the world’s biggest companies have taken fright at rising protectionism and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China.PwC said the rise in pessimism was unsurpassed in the 22 years it had been conducting the survey, with the downbeat mood a contrast to the bullishness of early 2018, when global growth was strong and stock markets were soaring.“CEOs’ views of the global economy mirror the major economic outlooks, which are adjusting their forecasts downward in 2019,” PwC’s global chairman, Bob Moritz, said. “With the rise of trade tension and protectionism it stands to reason that confidence is waning.”While the US retained its position as the top international market for growth over the next year, many CEOs have been turning to other markets, PwC said.“The turn away from the US market and shift in Chinese investment to other countries are reactions to the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China,” Moritz said.Kevin Ellis, the chairman and senior partner of PwC UK, said: “Uncertainty is at the forefront of UK CEOs’ minds but they know, regardless of market conditions, there are always opportunities for growth.

No, just B for Back to Brussels to Beg a Better Backstop, not even Botoxing her old plan A. Theresa May does not surprise. Wild rumours that she might dash for another election or resign mid-crisis fooled no one. Why expect better? If she pretended to listen to flotillas of visitors imploring her to see sense, change course, stop the madness, then she wore earplugs. Of course nothing changed. However, she has every reason for intransigence, strapped to her pilot seat, clamped in irons. Move an inch on the customs union, soften a red line and she would haemorrhage Tory MPs, winning few from Labour. Kate Hoey may cavort at Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Bollinger bash at his home to celebrate May’s 230-vote defeat, but entices no fellow Labour MPs.As the captive prime-minister-in-name-only runs the clock down closer to a nuclear no deal, how terrified should we be? Pay attention when her own business minister, Richard Harrington MP, warns that it would be such an “absolute disaster” that he would resign, warning of car industry collapse if supply chains were cut. Some cabinet ministers would walk, too, rather than take the blame for needless carnage. Every day brings more bad news: the International Air Transport Association warns that 5m sold airline tickets could be cancelled: no deal means no extra flights above last year’s quota.Contrary to Brexit myths, Calais is not ready for extra checks: read the ’s hair-raising report from lorry drivers. Think how unprepared we are to replicate EU agencies – atomic, medicines, chemicals and scores more. Some 10,000 extra civil servants are at work in Whitehall already: a crash-out needs a permanently bigger (but pointless) state, no small-state nirvana.Promises were made to replicate all EU grants to farmers and deprived areas: but for how long? Tariffs will cost business £6bn, while growth falls sharply and the pound is still weak, so far with zero benefit to exportimport trade balances. Refusing to pay that £39bn will make us debt-defaulting pariahs. Leaked documents show that the National Crime Agency is ready to declare no-deal day a “critical incident”. Cobra will meet, civil servants work 247, police leave cancelled, army reservists called up, the “agency responding to any threats” from “protest and public disorder, disruption at ports, transport blockages, food and fuel shortages”. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, says blandly: “Yes, we might risk up to six months of significant – but manageable – disruption.” That almost makes it worth putting him in charge to cope with public outrage. Remember in 2000 how a short blockade of fuel depots by a few brought the country to a halt and government to its knees, plunging in the polls. Don’t trust the “out now!” Brexiters not to lead the protests at fuel and food rationing. It doesn’t take much.Do you believe this self-inflicted Dad’s Army parody will actually happen? No, me neither: I’m not stockpiling. No deal means chaos. But I am confident that forces of good government will prevent it. Not because of Downing Street’s alarmingly unconvincing claim that it is “putting in place mitigations”, but because enough wise people will refuse. Start with MPs: a large majority know it can’t happen. They will surely back Yvette Cooper’s modest amendment delaying article 50 and EU withdrawal until the end of 2019, if parliament hasn’t set a deal by the end of February – and back Dominic Grieve’s motion for indicative votes on all options.If no-deal Brexit looms, will Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, do nothing? He should at least warn his permanent secretaries to demand from their ministers “letters of direction” to absolve them from having authorised shocking sums – £4.2bn so far, with no deal costing far more – for an entirely destructive act. No such letters are yet demanded by this pusillanimous generation of civil servants. Amyas Morse, comptroller general of the National Audit Office, should be blasting this wastage.You turn to the two thirds of people who are not adamantine, to MPs and ministers who take their job seriously – and to Labour whose leader today repeated his commitment to stopping no deal, staying open to a referendum. High time, too, that business made more noise, including the big supermarkets and household names hiding behind the CBI for fear of offending anyone.There is no easy healing of this miserable national rift. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer rightly says there are just two options now: a Norway soft Brexit or a referendum. With Norway we pay, leave borders open, obey each new EU edict with no voice, no veto. How long would that survive Brexit outrage at the first controversial EU directive imposed on us?I dread a referendum, but believe remain would probably win. Now people have seen the darker shades of Brexit never revealed for the first ballot, let them decide. Incidentally, focus groups show the so-called magic slogan, “Tell them again!”, only works with die-hard no dealers: those thinking again flinch at its aggressive tone. Simplistic slogans won’t swing it this time.

Dressed in custom-made Christian Dior playsuits, they then walked in their teetering pairs to the centre ring, where they rearranged themselves into a human archway for the models who followed them on to the catwalk.With a monumental exhibition about to open at the Victoria and Albert museum, this Christian Dior haute couture made the point that Dior, under first female designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, is as relevant to the future of fashion as to its history. This was Dior as politics and showbiz, not Dior as pomp and ceremony. With an all-female, all-body-shapes acrobatic company and evening dresses that referenced the “androgynous and asexual” aesthetic of the clown, Chiuri showed that there is much more to Dior than the full-skirted “new look”.In the slipstream of the phenomenal success of 2017 film The Greatest Showman, the circus is having a born-again pop cultural moment. The striped tent is a place “where beauty, origin, gender and age are no longer important, and only technique and daring matter,” as Chiuri’s show notes put it. “In a circus parade it is not just about being beautiful, it is about being proud, about being strong, about being bold and having fun,” she said backstage before the show. Rather than filling her head with archive images, her work on the upcoming exhibition had made her “think about fashion as an expression of society. In a fashion exhibition you can see in clothes the values of society changing. My job as the designer of Dior now is to make fashion that is connected to contemporary society.” Since Chiuri took over Dior, the influence of this venerable brand on fashion as it is worn on the street has become more direct. The “We Should All Be Feminists” T-shirts from Chiuri’s first show turned feminist-slogan T-shirts from an alternative fashion choice into a worldwide commercial hit that was picked up all along the high street.Quieter but no less pervasive has been the influence of her chosen skirt shape – long and softly full – which has seen skirts with lower hemlines and a softer silhouette become a mainstay in the modern wardrobe. This season, those skirts came in boiled wool, in black tulle and in knotted lamé. Flame embroidery, sequinned hot pants, and ringmaster jackets with flourishes of gold frogging kept the circus spirit alive. Black tailoring, which is what Chiuri most often wears herself, was less attention-grabbing, but brilliantly executed. As the designer noted: “The women who buy haute couture these days don’t just want party dresses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f85f6c7d389ab80ee03cdf92b49262338372eacf/0_228_4885_2931/master/4885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e20e31019958c876538c1f32d87668","title":"second thoughts the rise of the celebrity side hustle","story":"Clothing, makeup and other luxury lines can generate billions – far surpassing the money that some famous faces make from their original careersIt is a weird time to be make your living as a pop star. It is almost impossible to buy a new album on an average British high street, yet at every Boots in the country you can buy fragrances from Shawn Mendes, Little Mix, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Nicki Minaj, Ariana Grande, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo and Sarah Jessica Parker.However, in the last few years, celebrity makeup, clothing and other luxury lines have moved from a side hustle into a multi-billion-dollar industry that can generate fortunes for the famous that far surpass the money they make for doing the thing they’re famous for. Rihanna now makes more money from her Fenty Beauty makeup line than she does from music – the company turned over $100 million in its first 40 days trading. By comparison, in the whole of 2016, the last year she had a record out, she earned $7.6m from streaming and $2.5m from music sales. Drake is expected to make a $50m revenue this year from his OVO clothing brand, which opened a bricks-and-mortar shop in London’s Soho earlier last year. That’s $3m more than Forbes estimated he made from all his ventures over the previous year, despite being the most streamed artist in the world.Cassandra Napoli, associate editor of digital media \u0026amp marketing at fashion trend agency WGSN, says there is more to these lines than just putting your name to a product. “What’s new is celebrities creating brands that are relevant now, that tie into this cultural moment. With Rihanna, it’s about inclusivity and ersity, which has long been a topic on the runways for the past couple of years. When she launched her first foundation it came in 40 shades.”That is not to say that some people aren’t making a fortune even without cultural relevance. Britney Spears, who has not had a top 10 track since 2013, continues to sell millions of perfumes each year. She launched her first fragrance, Curious, in 2004. Thought at the time to be little more than an extension of her merchandising arm, Curious ended up being the top-selling fragrance of that year, netting more than $100 million. In 2017 it was estimated Spears has created $4.8bn in revenue from her perfumes – far more than she could ever hope to make from her music.One person closer to home who is as successful for her side hustles as for her role in reality TV is former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh. Her first foray into fashion was her eponymous label, which became Asos’s bestselling line after its in-house brands. Since leaving the programme in 2013, Mackintosh also launched a range of eyelashes, a venture that led to a full beauty range, sold exclusively through Boots.Her second collection launched in September. I asked Mackintosh what the difference is between a range like Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty, which has been widely praised and, say, Katy Perry’s fragrances, which feel inherently naff.“Ultimately it’s how authentic it feels,” she says. Mackintosh’s own makeup artist, Sarah Reygate, insists Mackintosh’s collection is good quality stuff she even uses it on her other clients, she says. (When challenged to show me her makeup bag, sure enough, among the Clinique and the Mac products, was the Millie Mackintosh lip-colour balm.)Mackintosh’s fashion line, however, folded earlier this year, with Mackintosh citing “the financial climate” as the reason for its closure at the time. Creditors, and Mackintosh herself, lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.This time around she doesn’t own the company – it’s a deal with SLG, a makeup company that has a wide range of licensing deals with celebrities and other brands. “I can sit back and enjoy and do the parts of it I really want to be involved in – the design, the promotion and the creative – that’s where I’m comfortable, not the numbers,” she says.Would a celebrity’s endorsement of a product ever sway the opinion of the ’s beauty columnist Sali Hughes? “No, definitely not, because I know how it works. The only time it would ever influence me is if it was with an expert in that field, so when the makeup artist, Pat McGrath, launched her beauty range, I was interested because I know her standards are high… but, in general, celebrity involvement is minimal they probably see five products and then pick one.”She says that doesn’t necessarily mean that all celebrity products are necessarily bad. “Kate Moss is a good example: her line of lipsticks for Rimmel are just really good.”The Moss range is technically a partnership the celebrity lends their name to a brand, without actually owning it. With those deals, the celebrity often gets paid a lump sum and sometimes a percentage of sales, to put their name to a product, but they won’t be exposed to any financial risk. Napoli gives the example of American brand Nordstrom’s three-year deal with Instagram influencer Arielle Charnas’s brand Something Navy: were it to not meet expectations, Nordstrom have taken on all the risk.These low-risk deals have become attractive to even the most cynical celebrities. In 2011, Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine tweeted: “I would like to put an official ban on celebrity fragrances. Punishable by death from this point forward.” Fast forward seven years and Levine has a range of fragrances – he says he wants to “compete with Dior” – as well as a fashion line in partnership with US clothing store Kmart.And then there are the celebrities who do own their own brands, such as 21-year-old Kylie Jenner, who three years ago was little more than the fourth or fifth most famous member of the Kardashian dynasty. Now she is on track to become the US’s “youngest self-made billionaire, according to Forbes.Jenner appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine after her personal fortune increased by about $900 million in the space of a couple of years, largely thanks to a cosmetics line with her name on it. Kylie Cosmetics by Kylie Jenner began three years ago as Kylie Lip Kits, selling multipacks of lipstick and lip liner. The initial run of 15,000, sold directly through Jenner’s website, sold out in one minute.Napoli gives an example of how Jenner combines her enormous influence over impressionable fans with the mechanics of Instagram-era retail to turn huge profits. “She subscribes to the drop model, so instead of doing a big product launch with months of lead-up, she’ll take over a San Francisco space, announce a pop-up shop on Instagram and get people to line up around the block. It gets people excited.”There are some brands where the celebrity in question has the majority stake in a private limited company, such as Alexa Chung, Victoria Beckham and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s fashion lines (although in some cases there also high profile investors). In the fashion world, these brands have been taken the most seriously – in part because, with personal fortune on the line, the designs tend to be more considered.That all of these deals boil down to money and name, brings up the awkward question of privilege. Forbes’ “self-made” descriptor drew significant criticism : “It is not shade to point out that Kylie Jenner isn’t self-made. She grew up in a wealthy, famous family,” tweeted Roxane Gay. “Her success is commendable but it comes by virtue of her privilege.” Even the dictionary got involved, with dictionary sarcastically tweeting “Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided.”Mackintosh does not come from a Kardashian-style dynasty – the depictions of her as a “Quality Street heiress” slightly miss the mark, she points out, given the business was sold long before she was born – but, of course, you only get cast on a show like Made in Chelsea if you come form a certain background.With brands such as Rimmel, Benefit, Barry M, Bourjois and others offering makeup kits at a similar price and also available at Boots, the success of her line may lie in “the Mackintosh appeal”. Do people buy her products because they want to look like her? “Yeah, there is that aspect to it,” she says.And, really, that strikes at the central offering of any celebrity line. Take the Kardashians: having redefined the ideals of beauty in their own image, preferencing heavy contouring, lip fillers and plastic surgery – as Amy Schumer once put it, they take the faces they were born with as a light suggestion– they are now selling the look back to the general public.But, according to Mackintosh, is not as simple as just whacking your name on a product and hoping for the best. “The ultimate test is the customer …” she said. “When it doesn’t do so well, it’s when it doesn’t feel authentic or the product is just not good and the customer can see through that.”Still, when you see Mackintosh’s range on the “3 for 2” section of the Boots website, alongside Little Mix Face Gems and the “Zoella Lifestyle Hot Chocolate Fragranced Candle” it does feel as though some celebrities are hoping that, with the right business model, a pre-existing fanbase and a knack for staying on the right side of Gen Z, they can reap rewards. Especially when you are targeting the gifting market, it feels as if the real test of popularity is not how many sets you sell, but how few end up on Ebay a month later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86370fa316359450fc7f00ceb49498afb2c9fbe9/0_90_4627_2778/master/4627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb23165296afa5e126a6e05e03e3076a","title":"paris mens fashion week the key collections in pictures","story":"A conveyor belt catwalk at Dior, a homage to Michael Jackson at Louis Vuitton and the return of the suit pretty much everywhere… Here are the Paris menswear show highlights for autumnwinter 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ced371064439b82f42e887af28b6dff8f5fc0b/0_377_3062_1837/master/3062.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3944bb314f2f886ad791a95ba756d020","title":"fiji water girl lands a cameo on the bold and the beautiful","story":"Kelleth Cuthbert became famous after popping up in the background of a series of celebrity portraits at the Golden GlobesThe serial photobomber who stole the show and became a meme after this year’s Golden Globes has made a new splash with a cameo on The Bold and the Beautiful.Canadian model Kelleth Cuthbert became known as Fiji Water Girl after popping up in the background of a series of celebrity portraits taken during the 72nd Golden Globes awards in January. She was at the event as one of a number of promotional staff for the water company, a Globes sponsor, but went viral after Twitter users noticed her face and distinctive blue dress turning up in shot after shot.Rumours about Cuthbert’s link to the long-running CBS soap opera began circulating after she posted a picture of herself with actors from The Bold and the Beautiful on Instagram last week, thanking the production team for having her on set.CBS haven’t confirmed her role as yet, or whether it will be an ongoing one, but the official Instagram account for The Bold and the Beautiful also posted a picture of Cuthbert on set, in the background, wearing a black dress and carrying … a tray of water.The Bold and the Beautiful appearance comes after stints on the Late Late Show With James Corden and E! News, among others, in the wake of her Golden Globes notoriety. IMDB currently lists her appearance at the Globes as “Fiji Water Girl”.Not everyone found Cuthbert’s knack for getting in the frame endearing: Jamie Lee Curtis said in a tweet that she had deliberately tried to move away from the promotional staff for the Globes sponsors, Fiji and Moet. “I didn’t want to be doing advertising for either. The sponsors of events need to get permission from people before they try to take their picture with them,” Curtis said.While some called the Golden Globes incident an obvious PR stunt, Cuthbert claimed she hadn’t set out to photobomb. “No matter where you move, you’re in somebody’s shot,” she later told the Cut. “I think from so many years of modelling, when I hear a shutter, I just kind of give a face.”The Bold and the Beautiful first aired in 1987 as a companion series to CBS’s other long-running soap, The Young and the Restless, and aired its 8000th episode this January. Cuthbert is expected to appear on the show on 6 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd71542f511c4fda43df7092a56d20e3c52a8bb7/0_172_8011_4809/master/8011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11a3a20c2ad41371de9f90741c077f37","title":"rachel roddys pasta alla gricia recipe guanciale pecorino","story":"Pasta alla gricia is the happy meeting of the melted fat of salt-cured pork jowls and grated pecorinoBetween new year and epiphany, I had two separate lunches with two separate Roman friends who live in London but were back for the holidays. Our lives in reverse, I had just returned to Rome after two weeks with my family in London. I have known both friends for more than a decade, and it is even longer since we swapped countries, yet we are still having the same conversations about work, weather, words, nostalgia and bread, which is really just a way of talking about belonging to two places, and holding on to the good and flawed parts of both. Both conversations ended in the same way, with the friends telling me that they were reluctant but ready to go home, but first needed to buy guanciale to take back with them.Guancia means cheek, and guanciale are the salt-cured pork jowls that hang like pepper-dusted paddles above salumerie (deli) counters in shops and on Roman market stalls. Unlike the more familiar pancetta (salt-cured pork belly) with its equal streaks of meat and fat, guanciale, like my cheeks after festive eating, is mostly fat. Cured with salt, and flavoured with only red or black pepper, the fat of guanciale has a thick, almost sweet and delicate flavour, which melts into a deeply flavoured and seasoned cooking medium.Along with strutto (lard), guanciale has been a most accessible and essential cooking fat in Rome for centuries. These days, olive oil is ubiquitous, but guanciale is still a favourite in Rome and Lazio, its rich flavour and binding power the mortar in many traditional dishes, and especially the quartet of classic Roman pastas – guanciale, pecorino and egg carbonara pecorino and black pepper cacio e pepe guanciale, tomato and pecorino amatriciana and the pre‑tomato ancestor of amatriciana, the lesser spotted but greatly loved amatriciana bianca, or gricia.Guanciale and pecorino are gricia. It is the happy meeting of melted fat and grated pecorino on the surface of the pasta itself, which – with the help of some starchy cooking water and a toss – results in a slightly emulsified and creamy sauce. While the need for guanciale and pecorino is single-minded, lots of different shapes and surfaces work for gricia, as illustrated by the traditional trattorie of Testaccio. Checchino Dal 1887 uses long, pierced bucatini, while Trattoria Da Bucatino favours spaghetti Trattoria Da Felice mezze maniche Agustarello tonnarelli and Perilli (the Fellini-esque trattoria and cavernous home to cummerbunds and trolleys on Via Marmorata) tubes of rigatoni for their white-fluted bowl of gricia.Like Perilli, I use rigatoni for my gricia, for no other reason than I like it, the ridged tubes seemingly designed to wear a cheese coat and hide the glistening batons of guanciale, a discovery akin to finding a forgotten two-pound coin in your pocket.New year, new reminder (as much for myself as anyone else): when it comes to cooking pasta, the rule of thumb is one litre of fast-boiling water for every 100g pasta. Bring the water to a rolling boil, add 10g coarse salt for every litre of it, stir, chuck in the pasta, stir again and boil, uncovered, until al dente. How you like your pasta cooked, though, is obviously entirely up to you.3 tbsp olive oil150g guanciale, cut into 2mm wide  3mm long batons120g pecorino romano, grated400-500g pasta – spaghetti, bucatini, penne, mezze maniche or rigatoniBring a large pan of water to the boil, add salt, add pasta, stir, and cook until al dente.Meanwhile, put the oil and guanciale into a large frying pan and fry gently for a few minutes, or until the fat has rendered and the pieces are shiny starting to crisp.Once the pasta is ready, drain, saving some of the starchy cooking water. Tip the pasta into the frying pan, toss, add two-thirds of the cheese and a little pasta cooking water, and toss again.Divide between bowls and top with the remaining cheese and a grind of black pepper, if you wish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99b632870980279f409030b39adec7bb64a47aa/0_36_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c8a432edf4fd3c55800ec540be992ee","title":"arsenal hector bellerin ruptured cruciate injury","story":"Héctor Bellerín’s season is over after he was diagnosed with a ruptured cruciate knee ligament and the Arsenal right-back faces a battle to be fit for the beginning of the next campaign.Bellerín collapsed in agony during his team’s 2-0 win against Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on Saturday and he now has the headline result in terms of the damage. But there could be yet more bad news for him as he waits to learn whether he has damaged the meniscus and other parts of the joint.The 23-year-old Spaniard had only just returned from a four-week lay-off because of a calf injury and the Chelsea game represented his return to the starting lineup. He has been left devastated by the setback and he must now begin what will be an arduous road back to full fitness.Bellerín will seek further medical opinions over the coming days which will help to place an exact time-frame on his absence. But a cruciate rupture normally involves a minimum of six months out.Unai Emery had said after the Chelsea game that the damage looked bad and the Arsenal manager must plan without one of his most influential players for the foreseeable future. Emery noted he had Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Stephan Lichtsteiner to cover in the position while he also mentioned Carl Jenkinson as a possible option.Emery is on record as saying that his room for manoeuvre in the January transfer window will be limited to loans, at best. The club spent £63.8m in net terms last summer to try to drive a return to the Champions League.Arsenal have already suffered horror injuries to Danny Welbeck and Rob Holding this season.

Her other advice is to “get rid of the word ‘should’”. People can put a lot of effort into what they think others want or expect from them, which they may have misjudged – a recipe for unhappiness, she says.Aiming for too-ambitious a goal can be setting yourself up for failure, knocking your self-confidence even if you have taken big steps towards it. A sense of accomplishment is key to maintaining your pride, says Blair, who suggests setting short- to mid-term goals.Although keeping to your comfort zone can offer short-term relief, it can backfire in the long term, says Chris Williams, professor of psychosocial psychiatry at the University of Glasgow. “It teaches you the unhelpful rule that the only way to cope is by avoiding things.” Think of that boost you feel once you tick off a challenge.Low self-esteem can sometimes lead to neglect of physical health. The mental health charity Mind recommends considering any negative impacts on your life of stress, exercise, sleep, diet and drugs and alcohol. Finding ways to relax and addressing any issues you may have with your diet or substances can have a significant effect on your sense of self-worth.Physical activity has been found to positively influence self-esteem and wellbeing. A 2016 study found that physical activity, perceived physical fitness and body image play an important role in self-esteem, and recommended that “regular physical activity should be promoted, in particular among adults reporting lower self-esteem”.Research published in the Journal of Public Health in 2015 found that just one session of gardening in an allotment yielded significant improvements in mood and self-esteem. If an allotment isn’t an option and you don’t have your own garden, search online for nearby gardening groups."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8973644d6398230e5bf2f5002489587888a82ee4/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b665340bfe01c992cfa4b63035a24a","title":"the kind of city where people go out on a monday night how to do liverpool like a local","story":"The port city is renowned for its culture and character. Get to know the bustling hive of activity with our insiders’ guide, courtesy of locals Oliver Press and David WilliamsWhether up close or far away, Liverpool is a city with impressive vistas. We’ve got beaches, parks, seafront and rooftops – but it’s not just the views keeping people enjoying the city. A fun-loving spirit, full of character and characters, it’s a city in the midst of a cultural renaissance, exploding with independents who keep us all eating, drinking and dancing.Liverpool is a city of makers and dreamers and it never feels more apparent after visiting the Wild Loaf. As well as supplying half the city with bread, it also has a small shop down an unassuming alley where you can buy fresh bread made that day, alongside its city-famous fresh doughnuts. For food on the go, Bakchich on Bold Street offers the best Lebanese food this side of Beirut.For a fancier dinner, it’s worth checking out Oktopus, which specialises in European small plates and craft beer, with a focus on fresh fish and seafood. Speaking of small plates, Maray and its beloved “disco cauliflower” on Bold Street is practically unmissable. As is Salt House Bacaro’s Italian-style tapas, which includes favourites such as ox-cheek lasagne.For something out of the city, get to Belzan (if you can get a seat, that is), located in the student area of Smithdown Road. It’s a classic neighbourhood bistro slinging out some of the best food in the city. If you’ve got room after, grab a wood-fired pizza from Little Furnace just opposite it. Hafla Hafla, a middle-eastern inspired restaurant, has just opened on Lark Lane. Its halloumi fries are worth travelling for alone. If sitting down and knives and forks aren’t your thing, head to Homebaked Anfield – the co-operative bakery opposite Liverpool FC’s home ground, with a queue down the block most days.All that eating can be thirsty work. If it’s wine you’re looking for, pop into Bunch, Liverpool’s first natural-wine bar. On Berry Street, it specialises in off-the-shelf, small-batch wines you’d struggle to find anywhere else. A small stumble a couple of doors down and you’ll be at Berry \u0026amp Rye, the city’s premiere speakeasy – a blacked-out joint with no sign, which can be missed in the blink of an eye. If you find the door, walk in for the bluesy prohibition-era atmosphere and a whisky collection impressive by just about anyone’s standards.In a time where pubs are closing so frequently, many of the local boozers that are surviving have started doing things a bit differently. The Caledonia, a pub in the Georgian Quarter with a great history, has set up its own community library and recently switched up its menu to be completely vegan. It has been attracting students and hungry hipsters ever since. Just around the corner is Peter Kavanagh’s, a pub full of curios and characters that is also definitely worth a visit. For something grander, head to the Philharmonic Dining Rooms, a beautifully ornate – and gigantic – boozer that is very popular for pre-theatre drinks.Meanwhile, the Merchant on Slater Street, with its Scandi-cool decor, is a great place to dance with an Aperol spritz in hand. For a night of sophisticated tunes and drinks, head to Frederiks on Hope Street – one of Liverpool’s top jazz bars – or Kazimier Garden, a beautiful urban oasis where you can catch an eclectic programme of live music and imbibe from a list of great craft beers.If alcohol isn’t your thing, 92 Degrees Coffee will provide your caffeine fix they roast the coffee beans themselves so you’ll smell it before you see it. For tea, don’t miss Leaf on Bold Street, one of Liverpool’s most popular independents specialising in loose-leaf tea.If you’re hoping to take a bit of the real Liverpool home with you, you could do worse than to pay a visit to Matta’s, again on Bold Street – a family-run business for more than 30 years and the city’s premiere shop for international, vegan and healthy foods. In other words, Matta’s is a Liverpool institution. Vinyl heads, make sure you check out Probe Records and Dig Vinyl. For clothes, Resurrection on Bold Street has some great bargains and Outsiders will provide you with all the latest streetwear. If you dream about pastry, visit Artisane on Bold Street for Parisian-style baked goods or pop into the family-run Rough Handmade at the Albert Dock for their famous pillowy pita breads. If you fancy something off the beaten track, stroll on down to Queen Avenue, known as Liverpool’s Diagon Alley among the locals, with its cobbled paving and olde worlde shop facades. Pop in and see wine merchant Devin Stewart at R\u0026ampH Fine Wines for a bottle of something special.Liverpool was once famously described as the kind of city where people go out on a Monday night and couldn’t care less about the Tuesday morning. Never does that feel more apparent than at Camp and Furnace, where the phenomenon began. Thursdays are the new Friday, well at least according to the twins behind Shit Indie Disco, a weekly club night helping revellers relive the golden era of indie. If you’re more into your electro and techno nights, check out Abandon Silence. Constellations in Baltic Triangle and Invisible Wind Factory in the North Docks are also very well known for their wide range of weekly blockbuster events.If you fancy dancing like nobody’s watching, there’s nothing quite like a night at Jenny’s Bar – it’s a disco den with one of the most stunning interiors. The Jacaranda has always been famous for music and all those decades later you can still get a taste of the local music scene.It’s no secret that Liverpool is blessed with some stunning buildings and public spaces, so it’s a damn good thing that it’s also easy to get around the city. The good public transport and bike-rental schemes are loved by the locals, but the city is also highly walkable. And getting the train into the city couldn’t be easier with London Northwestern Railway, which runs plenty of services from Birmingham, London and elsewhere. Plus, there are savings to be had if you book in advance.We may have bias, but the waterfront and the Three Graces are up there with the best when it comes to said buildings and public spaces. At the stunning Sefton Park you’ll find the Palm House – a dome-shaped Victorian palm house with lush flora, and a regular venue for events. Liverpool Cathedral, St George’s Hall and Central library are all musts. For great exhibitions, check out the Museum of Liverpool, Maritime Museum and World Museum. If you get chance and fancy admiring Liverpool from a different angle, Everton Brow offers a view like no other.If you fancy seeing the waterfront from a different angle, climb on board a ferry across the Mersey for picturesque views. For something a bit different, go on a Shiverpool tour, the award-winning ghost tour of the city’s Georgian Quarter. Once you’ve seen the sights, relax at Sugar \u0026amp Dice in the Baltic Triangle – it’s Liverpool’s premiere board-gaming cafe and offers the perfect respite from the modern world.Liverpool’s got loads of amazing art. We’re talking world-class paintings, modern works that make your head spin and street pieces worth seeking out. If you’re by the Three Graces, drop into Open Eye Gallery – a photography gallery with great exhibitions. The Bluecoat is the oldest building still standing in the city centre and houses bookshops, art galleries, plant shops and more. For theatres, check out The Everyman \u0026amp Playhouse, Liverpool Philharmonic Hall, Royal Court, Unity theatre or Hope St theatre for something more cutting-edge. The Baltic Triangle is the area in Liverpool everybody’s talking about and it’s become quite famous for the street art, especially the Liver Bird Wings by Paul Curtis.

This Londoner’s guide will help you avoid some potential clangersThe tubeFor something whose sole aim is to get people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They’re known as flying rats for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it. London Northwestern Railway is your gateway to thriving centres such as Birmingham and Liverpool, with the advantage of free wifi throughout the whole train, as well as free online entertainment, so you can pass the time by watching the latest blockbuster or box set.For the best value tickets, with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff736998db552449ecc576f29db7c185a93fe2f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e47f75f1c6ca026f89244a410185cee1","title":"the diary of a brummie 24 hours in birmingham","story":"It’s the second most populous city in the UK and attracted 42 million visitors this year. Here’s author  Mike Gayle’s guide to the top things to see, eat and drink in the Midlands cityBirmingham may be known as the UK’s “second city”, but when it comes to my home town’s vibrant galleries, cafes, shops and Michelin-starred restaurants, it’s nothing less than first rate. Slap-bang in the middle of the country, it’s perfectly located for an easy weekend getaway. London Northwestern Railway does great off-peak return tickets at around £20-£30 – so you don’t have to book months in advance to get a good deal. And now that you’re here, let me show you some of what my city has to offer. I was born here and, after a spell in the capital, returned when I became a full-time author. It’s now where I live with my wife and daughters, aged 15 and 12. Brum, I promise, has got it all going on. So if you’ve only got 24 hours to spend here, it’s definitely going to be action packed. Here’s a rough itinerary to help you make the most of your day:9.00–10.30Spend the morning getting to know the city centre. It’s an often mocked but nonetheless true fact that Birmingham has more miles of canal than Venice, so why not see some of them for yourself? Sherborne Wharf offers a variety of city centre jaunts. Afterwards, get in a few quick cultural hits with a visit to the new library (stunning views across the city from the sixth floor) and then follow through to Brindley Place to Ikon, an internationally acclaimed contemporary art gallery. Here, you can also find a branch of local indie cafe, Yorks, where you can enjoy a well-earned cuppa and a slice of homemade cake.10.30–12.00If you’re up for a spot of retail therapy, you’ll be spoilt for choice. Head to the Bullring and Grand Central for stores such as Selfridges and John Lewis, or if you’re after something a little more cheap and cheerful, try the Rag market for stalls selling everything from sari material to vintage punk clothing. For those in the mood to splurge, head to the Mailbox for Harvey Nichols, Heal’s and Paul Smith. If shopping isn’t your thing, however, there are plenty of museums to explore, too. The Museum and Art Gallery is free to enter and now the permanent home to the world-famous Staffordshire hoard. If you prefer your museums on the quirky side, try the Coffin Works (an award-winning independent museum dedicated to the production of coffin furniture!), or the Pen Museum, the only institution in the UK devoted to the history of pen making. Peaky Blinders fans should head to the National Trust property, the Back to Backs. Here, in the city’s last surviving court of 19th-century back-to-back houses, you can see firsthand the homes that served as the inspiration for the hit show’s set designer, Grant Montgomery.12.00–13.30After all that exploring, you’ll probably need to refuel. If you’re on the Jewellery Quarter side of the city, head for the chilled vibes of Otto, an authentic pizzeria famous for its Neapolitan-style pizzas. Afterwards, take a stroll across leafy St Paul’s Square, the city’s only Georgian square, to wash down your lunch with the perfect flat white at Saint Kitchen. For veggies, the revamped Warehouse Cafe is a must, or if you’re looking for something more Instagrammable, 1847’s visually stunning, plant-based delights will certainly fit the bill.13.30–15.00If you’re feeling ready for an afternoon nap after all that food, heading down to Digbeth will wake you up. Once known mainly for its coach station, Digbeth is now seen as one of the coolest places to live in the UK. Start in the Custard Factory, a complex of cafes, shops and galleries located within the hallowed walls of the old Bird’s Custard factory. Here, you can catch a cult film at the Mockingbird Cinema, treat yourself to a couple of craft beers from Clink, indulge in a spot of retail therapy (anything from vintage fashion at Cow Vintage to boards and accessories at Ideal Skateboard Supply), and if that’s not enough, how about a game of crazy golf with an urban twist at Ghetto Golf just around the corner?15.00–16.30By now, you might be in the mood for something a little different. Grab a cab and head 20 minutes south of the city to Cannon Hill park. Covering 81 hectares (200 acres), you can take a swan boat out on the lake, enjoy a woodland walk or a ride on the land train. Cannon Hill is also home to Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park. Here, you can see red pandas, European lynx, lemurs, cranes, snakes, lizards and family favourites such as goats, guinea pigs and sheep. And if that’s not enough, Cannon Hill is also the site of the MAC, a space for galleries, cafes, theatre, cinema and concerts.16.30–18.00It might be a good idea to zip back to your accommodation for a quick regroup (andor power nap). While there are tonnes of great places to stay on Airbnb, there are some fantastic independent hotels and apartments, too. Fancy a room with curved walls and some of the best views of the Brum cityscape? Head to Staying Cool at the iconic Rotunda for its one- and two-bedroom serviced apartments. In the mood for a Shoreditch-style boutique hotel? Then Saint Pauls House in the Jewellery Quarter is for you. And for those on a tighter budget, Bloc Hotel Birmingham has some great budget rooms with a designer vibe.18.00–19.30So you’re refreshed (or as refreshed as you’re ever going to be), but you’re not feeling hungry yet and you’ve had enough coffee to keep an elephant awake. A trip to an escape room could be just what you need. Exciting Game Birmingham comes highly recommended on TripAdvisor, as does Escape Reality. Alternatively, how about a trip to Tilt, a cool cafe bar that’s home to a collection of more than 20 working vintage pinball machines? In the mood to try something more physical? Head to Rock Up climbing centre at Broadway Plaza, or Boing Zone, a trampoline park just a short taxi ride away from the city centre.19.30–21.00It’s finally dinner time and you’ll be glad to know there are all manner of culinary treats to choose from. Prefer to stay in the city centre? Look no further than the Digbeth Dining Club, a ticketed street food event that takes place every Friday and Saturday, featuring music, entertainment and a rolling cast of street-food vendors. Alternatively, get yourself over to the cornucopia of delights known as the Balti Triangle. Make a beeline for the Ladypool Road area, where you’ll find mouthwatering and authentic Indian, Bangladeshi and Kashmiri cooking, of which Shababs and Al Frash are particular favourites. Most of the restaurants on this strip are BYOB, so you’ll be able to save a few quid on booze. If curries aren’t your thing, there’s Antep (Turkish), Al-Bader (Lebanese and Moroccan) or Jerk \u0026amp Twist (Caribbean). And if you still have room for pudding, there are plenty of dedicated shops to chose from, Artisan desserts (run by Ali Imdad, former Great British Bake Off contestant) being one of the best.21.00 – 02.00By now, you may be getting your second wind. If so, grab a cab and venture to York Road in Kings Heath, a great location for hip places to drink. Start off at the Juke, a bar that has a neat line of craft ales, as well as a 30-year-old jukebox imported from Chicago. Afterwards, head to organic wine specialist Grace + James and sample the orange wine and imported cheeses. And if you’re still not ready to hit the sack, Hare and Hounds, a Grade II-listed pub, is the perfect place to finish off the night. Along with a good selection of beers and wines, you’ll also find live music and top DJs.For the best value tickets to Birmingham with no booking fee, visit londonnorthwesternrailway"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ab282791abe4e5cf465ab8c52712fd845c451a/134_0_5018_3012/master/5018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e50f5888531f4665b387ac597b534015","title":"simon mayo joins new classical radio station after bbc exit","story":"Ex-Radio 2 presenter becomes latest to move to commercial rival with launch of Scala RadioSimon Mayo is to launch a national classical music radio station, becoming the latest BBC presenter to depart for a commercial rival as the corporation struggles to keep hold of its top talent.The broadcaster quit Radio 2 at the end of last year after more than three decades with the BBC, following a troubled year sharing his afternoon slot with Jo Whiley in a format that flopped with listeners.At the time, he insisted he would concentrate on writing novels, but he has now been announced as the mid-morning host and face of Scala Radio, a station designed to have a more casual and youthful approach than its established rivals, with a focus on film scores and work by modern composers alongside the likes of Mozart and Holst.The station is owned by Bauer Media, which also runs Absolute Radio and Kiss, and is due to launch on 4 March on DAB radio and online, putting it in direct competition with Global Media’s Classic FM and BBC Radio 3.Mayo said: “There are hundreds of radio stations playing rock and pop, and only two classical music stations – until now. Some of it will be familiar, some new and exciting, but all timeless, beautiful and all absolutely relevant to today.”Weekend presenters will include the former Madonna producer William Orbit and the drum’n’bass DJ Goldie, who will provide “a narration of his own journey into classical music”. Mayo’s BBC film reviewing partner Mark Kermode will host a weekend programme based on film soundtracks.Mayo joins a recent exodus of radio talent from the BBC: Radio 4’s Eddie Mair joined LBC and the Radio 2 breakfast show host Chris Evans jumped ship to Rupert Murdoch’s Virgin Radio.The boom in digital radio listening in cars and on smartphones, aided by the growing popularity of smart speakers such as Amazon’s Echo and Google Home, is prompting listeners to try new outlets. This in turn is bringing hefty investment to the UK digital radio market, pushing up presenter salaries and encouraging the launches of new stations.The BBC, which still accounts for almost half of radio listening in the UK, is attempting to adapt to a digital future with its BBC Sounds app and investment in podcasts, but has to deal with the publication of the salaries of its most well-paid stars following an edict from the government.Many leading male presenters were asked to take pay cuts after an outcry over inequality, while others were unsettled by their finances being made public – enabling deep-pocketed commercial rivals to swoop in and make compelling offers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5851685dd130764156c9908aacdc0be56a545b9/20_13_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e0a9f84b11147fb78ead79081d6c0e","title":"jacinda ardern asked in bbc interview if she plans to propose to her partner","story":"Eyebrows raised in New Zealand after Victoria Derbyshire questions the prime minister’s feminist credentialsA BBC interview with Jacinda Ardern is raising eyebrows after the New Zealand prime minister was asked whether she has any plans to propose marriage to her partner Clarke Gayford and was questioned over her feminist credentials.Ardern met with UK prime minister Theresa May early this week and is now making her way to Switzerland to attend the world economic forum in Davos.During a wide-ranging interview with the BBCs Victoria Derbyshire, Ardern discussed her hopes for a future trade deal with the UK post-Brexit, the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane, and the changing global world order.Concluding the interview Derbyshire asked Ardern whether she had any plans to propose to her long-term partner Clarke Gayford, who is the father to their child, and a fishing presenter on New Zealand television.The prime minister laughed loudly at the awkward question, seemingly surprised, and then answered: “No I would not ask, no.”“You’re a feminist?” replied Derbyshire. “Oh absolutely, absolutely I am a feminist” said Ardern.“But no, I want to put him through the pain and torture of having to agonise about that question himself, that’s letting him off the hook, absolutely not.”“Ok, fair enough,” said Derbyshire. “We await that day.”Ardern was also questioned on how she juggles running a country and being a new Mum, and whether she experiences “guilt” regarding the balancing act.Ardern said it was “sometimes a struggle” but it was giving her a valuable and “insightful” experience that was more closely akin to how regular women juggled their work and family responsibilities.New Zealand-based political commentator Bryce Edwards said the question regarding Ardern’s marriage status seemed to take the prime minister by surprise, and it was unusual for her to have her “feminist credentials” questioned.“Such a question is actually very surprising, and the prime minister’s reaction suggested that she was entirely surprised by it,” said Edwards, adding that the episode was reminiscent of a 2017 interview in which Ardern was questioned on whether or not she was planning to start a family.“Certainly a lot of New Zealanders would see such probing of the prime minister about her relationship with her partner and her plans for marriage as being inappropriate.”Some on social media noted that it would be unusual to hear a male prime minister asked a similar question."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa370ade540f8f0270811c3c34180ca909ec819/48_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a653e98de7c5d030dda31ad760b86471","title":"fyre festival co founder ja rule criticises new documentaries netflix hulu","story":"Rapper claims Hulu and Netflix paid people involved in the failed music event for their participation in two new filmsRapper Ja Rule has criticised two new documentaries about Fyre festival, the failed luxury music event in the Bahamas of which he was a co-founder alongside Billy McFarland.Fyre was due to take place on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma over two weekends in April and May 2017. The festival was promoted on the image of luxury nonpareil including lavish beach houses and proximity to leading models and influencers.Both Hulu’s Fyre Fraud and Netflix’s Fyre detail the festival’s inability to fulfil basic infrastructure, let alone extravagant extras, leaving thousands of festivalgoers stranded without accommodation, food and water. McFarland was convicted of defrauding investors out of $27.4m (£21.3m) and jailed for six years in federal prison.Ja Rule tweeted: “I love how ppl watch a doc and think they have all the answers.” He called out the streaming platforms for allegedly paying people involved in the fiasco for their participation in the documentaries.

Readers have been debating Brexit the morning after the prime minister survived a confidence vote I think the prime minister just wants to do this “reaching out” as a PR exercise at the end of which she can announce “I tried, but no one else came up with another answer that respects the referendum... So you have accept my deal.”Her notorious rigidity is a major part of the problem. She fundamentally lacks the qualities to move this forward. Although she cannot be removed, she has to be circumvented to allow other options to be explored. SnagaThe purpose of May’s little speech last night was to play to the gallery of Daily Mail readers and to set the scene for blaming Brexit on the Labour Party. At a time when she needed to speak to the nation she was as isive as ever. GiantrobotThis is possibly the most abject failure of the British political system since the civil war. It’s the very definition of a constitutional crisis. The fact that Parliament can claim to have confidence in the government says that Parliament itself is broken. The citizens of the UK need a means of dissolving Parliament. helicanIt appears that May wants to have talks but doesn’t want to concede anything. Of course a second referendum should be on the table. The talks may conclude that it shouldn’t happen, but surely that is the whole point of talks.On Jeremy Corbyn’s refusal to meet unless she ruled out no deal, she said, “the door is always open.” Well, there’s no point having an open door if she doesn’t have an open mind. BellaTheCookCorbyn and the shadow cabinet absolutely right to insist the dangerous, flailing and failing May takes no deal off the table before they engage in any talks. May is totally responsible for this disaster and in the power of the DUP whose agenda cares nothing for the well being of the whole nation.The contempt with which May and the likes of Michael Gove talk of Corbyn is disgusting considering the harm created by Tories to our declining economy. They have made us the laughing stock of Europe. SissyJupe20May has no idea how to compromise and isn’t about to start now unless her hand is forced. The opposition parties should now unite behind Corbyn’s refusal to have a dialogue until no deal is taken off the table. At the very least they could extract from her a binding vote on it in the Commons.Ultimately though, we saw yesterday that the DUP can call time on her leadership whenever they want, so I assume they’ll be telling her what to do from now on. smazakIt’s time for Theresa May to abandon her red lines. Otherwise she’s merely trying to share blame. Without some gesture from her to indicate a willingness to actually change something, “nothing has changed”. PaulB1I don’t agree with Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but his insistence on Maybot taking “no deal” off the table is absolutely right. Impossible to talk while this vile dictatorial PM arrogantly refuses to listen to anyone except her rapidly shrinking team of sycophants. darquangeI am absolutely furious, that a bunch of self important, over privileged MPs are trying to strip young people of the same opportunities that I had. Its what you expect from the Tories who have always been the party of grumpy old men and busybodies who want to control everyone else. But what with Labour? SporadicWitIt’s beyond disingenuous to claim that Labour don’t have a plan. During the transition period, Labour want to remain in the customs union and the single market, abiding by the rules of both. Longer terms they seek to negotiate a new UK-EU customs union to avoid tariffs and prevent a hard border in Ireland. That seems like a sensible approach – maintain the status quo, but leave, allowing us time to transition slowly. We would be able to leave the customs union at any time, once we’ve begun the separation process. SharkcustardWell over 500 MPs want a no deal taken off the table. For the first time in this Brexit mess May should show good faith and stop the bullying. If she doesn’t then the short to medium problems will affect those with a bit of money dissatisfied with the increased hassle and cost of travel – and all of the other problems that come with a no deal. Those with no money will be worse off in the longer term. So many of her natural supporters will be immediately affected and they will punish her if her brinkmanship doesn’t work, as it’s only in her power to take a no deal off the table. jonniestewpot"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b99e153ebecd999e005561721962751df3dbb02/0_80_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=388bb2eef1e005e5c3d82125da1ceccb","title":"john crace blue monday for mps as theresa may brexit strategy proves futile once more","story":"The prime minister seems to have no understanding about the imminence of BrexitTell me why I don’t like Mondays.

And a Theresa May statement in which she reiterates her determination to pursue a Brexit strategy that has already been voted down by parliament is a step too far for everyone.We’ve now reached the point where even the EU has taken to rejecting her latest plans to reopen negotiations before she has got round to announcing them.

Come 29 March, she could effectively be flatlining. Though how anyone would know the difference is another matter. Even at her best, May has always operated on the edges of consciousness. Not so much artificial intelligence as artificial stupidity.The prime minister began by saying she had been listening to politicians from other parties. It was just a shame it had all been white noise though she had been delighted Jeremy Corbyn had not bothered to waste her time by turning up to ask for something she had no intention of giving. It had saved a great deal of time for both of them and gave her the moral high ground. Basically what people had to remember was that in a straight fight between the national interest and keeping the more extreme wing of the Tory party on board, the ERG would win hands down.So here was the plan. She couldn’t possibly rule out a no-deal because that would involve extending article 50. And that was something to which she couldn’t agree because that would be tantamount to kicking the can further down the road. This from a prime minister whose only identifiable talent is for kicking cans down the road. As so often, the only person whom the irony escaped was May. Plus ça change.Indeed the sole purpose of the prime minister’s current statement was to waste at least a couple of weeks on doing nothing very much in the hope that enough of her MPs would be bored into submission and forget that they had already voted against the Plan A which she was resubmitting as a Plan B.It was like watching a five-year-old child bungling a card trick while the grown-ups pretended not to notice. A prime minister with any sense of self-worth would have resigned long ago. The sense of shame would be unbearable.The Labour leader is not averse to a bit of Brexit can-kicking himself – why make a decision when the Tories are screwing things up brilliantly on their own? – but now he appeared like a model of clarity. Which bit of the EU saying it would not renegotiate the backstop hadn’t she understood over the past 18 months? The time had come for her to drop her red lines and adopt proposals that could command the support of the majority of MPs.“La, la, la,” May snapped, sticking her fingers in her ears. She had her plan. And just because it had failed once there was no reason why it should fail a second time. Hadn’t she always said that a bad deal was better than a no-deal?Thereafter a succession of MPs from both sides of the house became increasingly exasperated as they tried and failed to talk her out of her madness. The more rational they became about the need to consider a customs union, extending Article 50 and a second referendum, the more adamant the prime minister became that the road to glory was paved with failure. One can only hope May is busy stockpiling her own medication. If she’s like this now, I’d hate to imagine what she’ll be like when she’s forced to go cold turkey at the end of March.Labour’s Barry Sheerman tried to instil a note of optimism. Today was Blue Monday. Officially the most depressing day of the year. So could they take a rain check and come back tomorrow when they all might be feeling slightly less bleak. May declined. The very idea was an affront. She hadn’t got where she was today by doing anything to give people cause for optimism. There was no situation she could not make worse. And she’d started, so she would finish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de21ba73f3ff1ab4a1425d8a4dde21196fd43ff/203_0_1569_941/master/1569.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f5b0648d5285eca04b7fd5daf6c6ad","title":"labour calls for vote in commons on holding second referendum","story":"Proposed amendment is significant shift in policy towards people’s vote on BrexitLabour has said the Commons should be able to vote on whether to hold a second referendum in an amendment the party submitted on Monday night to Theresa May’s Brexit update.It is the first time the party has asked MPs to formally consider a second poll, although the carefully worded compromise amendment did not commit the party’s leadership to backing a referendum if such a vote were to take place.The wording called for May’s government to hold a vote on two options – its alternative Brexit plan and whether to legislate “to hold a public vote on a deal or a proposition” that is supported by a majority in the Commons.The intervention came as the party’s leadership seeks to deal with isions between Jeremy Corbyn and some of the leader’s closest allies who are sceptical about a second referendum and those who are more enthusiastic such as Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer.The party’s alternative Brexit plan, which would be the subject of a separate vote if the amendment were carried, proposes that the UK remain in a post-Brexit customs union with the European Union and have a strong relationship with the single market. Citizens’ rights and consumer standards would be harmonised with the EU’s.Corbyn said: “Our amendment will allow MPs to vote on options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a no-deal. It is time for Labour’s alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.”But second referendum campaigners were last night gearing up to criticise the alternative Brexit plan. The People’s Vote campaign said that it was one of a series of Brexit promises – like no-deal – that were being made with “little regard for what could actually be delivered”.The cross-party group, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, posed five questions that it believes Corbyn’s Brexit model struggles to answer, escalating tensions between campaigners and the party’s leadership.A 16-page evaluation placed Labour’s plan on a par with both the no-deal option supported by hard Brexit Tories and the Norway-plus customs union alternative, in that they were no better than pledges made by the leave campaign at the time of the EU referendum.“All three alternative plans,” the analysis added “share many similarities with the arguments made for Brexit in 2016 when big promises were made with little regard for what could actually be delivered.”It quoted an interview with Corbyn in which he said he would be opposed to any deal that would make the UK poorer, and then cited a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research that said “every form of Brexit will damage the UK economy”.The analysis also asked whether the UK would “have any say over its trade policy” under Labour’s policy of remaining in a customs union with some decision-making power over future EU trade agreements.The document, whose authors are not named, said “it is almost inconceivable that the EU would agree” – citing the EU’s Lisbon treaty – and that “being in a customs union without a say would be very damaging” because the UK would be force to liberalise markets to third countries on a non-reciprocal basis.Tensions within Labour have been rising as MPs who support a second referendum want to pressurise Corbyn into supporting another Brexit vote, in line with the party’s policy to explore it as an option if it cannot secure an early election.A total of 71 Labour MPs declared they supported a second referendum last week on the morning of the day the party lost a vote of no confidence in Theresa May’s government, meaning that an early election was unlikely.The group is planning to take the argument further at a news conference on Tuesday, fronted by Labour MPs David Lammy and Bridget Phillipson with Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson and Caroline Lucas, the Green party leader in Westminster.Labour backbencher and second referendum supporter David Lammy said the amendment represented “a big step forward” but added that the party’s alternative Brexit proposal “deserves to be properly scrutinised” now that Corbyn wanted it to be centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1453972616579252c1150ddd959af093d18ede77/1593_825_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e207c4a08dff1bae58b355484ec43","title":"how ukip embraced the far right podcast","story":"With Brexit talks stalled and some of its supporters pushing a betrayal narrative, the ’s Peter Walker charts how Ukip has begun rising in the polls again.

Given that they lack bones, the scientists say the discovery of an ancient hagfish was a surprise.“It’s as rare as finding a fossilised sneeze,” said Prof Phillip Manning, a co-author of the study and chair of natural history at the University of Manchester.Writing in the Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences, the team say analysis of the fossil, including a mapping of chemical elements, reveals a number of features seen in hagfish today – slime glands included.As well as being astonishing in its own right, the fossilised creature – given the name Tethymyxine tapirostrum, or “slimy fish from the Tethys Sea with a long tapering snout” – could lay to rest a row among experts about where hagfish sit on the evolutionary tree of vertebrates.Some believe the form of hagfish suggests similar creatures belong near the base of that tree, with jawless creatures called lampreys, armoured fish, and other vertebrates evolving as time went on. But there is a problem: analysis of DNA from hagfish and lampreys is at odds with this picture, suggesting instead that these species both evolved from an ancient creature that had branched off early on.“For many years the data you got from the DNA didn’t match with what we saw in the fossil record,” Manning told the . Without fresh fossils, the debate raged on. But now, says Manning, the conundrum appears to have been solved.Manning said the branching that gave rise to hagfish and lamprey probably took place place about 500m years ago. But quite what the common ancestor of these creatures and all other vertebrates looked like is still something of a mystery, although the team say it was probably more typically “fish-like”.“This ancestor, X, which exists somewhere, gives rise directly to the hagfish and lampreys but also gives rise to a line of other jawless fish and the true fishes and vertebrates such as us,” said Manning.The hunt for that creature continues. “There is going to be this ancestor lurking either in a museum drawer or still in the ground,” Manning said. “Which is fun. That means there is still work for palaeontologists to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c19771b52d5495f05958a5b1c9dd7303332a8f/114_152_3886_2332/master/3886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18637cfa3cc4e2006353b900027a98af","title":"david attenborough tells davos the garden of eden is no more","story":"Human activity has created a new era yet climate change can be stopped, says naturalistSir David Attenborough has warned that “the Garden of Eden is no more”, as he urged political and business leaders from around the world to make a renewed push to tackle climate change before the damage is irreparable.Speaking at the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the 92-year-old naturalist and broadcaster warned that human activity has taken the world into a new era, threatening to undermine civilisation.That stability allowed businesses to grow, nations to co-operate and people to share ideas, Attenborough explained, before warning sombrely: “In the space of my lifetime, all that has changed.“The Holocene has ended. The Garden of Eden is no more. We have changed the world so much that scientists say we are in a new geological age: the Anthropocene, the age of humans,” he declared.In a stark warning to the world leaders and business chiefs flocking to the WEF this week, Attenborough warned that the only conditions that humans have known are changing fast.“We need to move beyond guilt or blame, and get on with the practical tasks at hand.”A survey conducted before the WEF found that environmental threats are now the biggest danger to the global economy, and concern is mounting that co-operation between countries on the issue is breaking down.Attenborough admitted that even he has been surprised by the speed of the damage caused to the environment during his career making TV programmes showing life on earth.In response, Attenborough – recently voted Britain’s most trustworthy celebrity – said humans must use their expert problem-solving skills. “If people can truly understand what is at stake, I believe they will give permission for business and governments to get on with the practical solutions,” he told the WEF.Get it right, he argued, and humans can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy and sustainable fish stocks, but only if decisive action is taken now.“Over the next two years there will be United Nations decisions on climate change, sustainable development and a new deal for nature. Together these will form our species’ plan for a route through the Anthropocene.“What we do now, and in the next few years, will profoundly affect the next few thousand years,” he added.Speaking to journalists after his speech, Attenborough warned that economic models needed to change. “Growth is going to come to an end, either suddenly or in a controlled way,” he explained, citing the old joke that anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth in finite circumstances is “either a madman or an economist”.He is also hopeful that he can change hearts and minds during his trip to Davos, pointing out that some delegates have more power than a nation state. “The enormity of the problem has only just dawned on quite a lot of people ... Unless we sort ourselves out in the next decade or so we are dooming our children and our grandchildren to an appalling future.”Before he spoke, Attenborough received the Crystal award from the WEF for his work. Saudi Arabia’s first female film-maker, Haifaa al-Mansour, and conductor Marin Alsop of the Baltimore Symphony were also honoured for their work.Prince William is due to appear with Attenborough to discuss environmental issues at the WEF on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b692154a1ed3c627362afdfe5a967e86930f1ec/0_194_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=078103fc3b18377f50c41f61246e2e33","title":"a day with the men about to make it across the us border at any cost","story":"Central American migrants escaping poverty and violence in their hometowns find crossing legally is a slow and difficult processAt the age of 14, Jonathan Levit was given an order by the infamously brutal Mara Salvatrucha gang in his native Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras: to kill a friend he had known throughout childhood – “like a brother, all my life”.Jonathan had, like almost every child in the city of Tela’s terrifying barrio of Colonia 15 de Septiembre, grown up in the gang’s shadow there was no avoiding it, especially if you were partial to a smoke, as he was. And now the time had come for him to execute “a mission” for what is also called MS-13 – the gang which, Jonathan says, “doesn’t just run Colonia 15, they almost run Honduras”.“But,” Jonathan recalls, “I’d rather have a friend than a peso in my pocket, and I refused. Whatever the price, that’s something I wouldn’t do.”The MS-13 death sentence was accordingly switched: Jonathan would die instead.Jonathan lived to tell his story this week in the courtyard of Casa del Migrante (Migrant House) at Ciudad Juárez in northernmost Mexico – cheek-by-jowl with El Paso, Texas. Having fled Honduras, he is determined to escape to the United States. Jonathan is one of 4,000 migrants since November last year, mostly from Central America, to pass through this center – operated by the Catholic diocese, run by two social workers, and volunteers.Jonathan wears an orange jacket and shock of black hair his eyes are obsidian-deep and quick with mischief and wit. He remembers his life back home unhappily, without sentiment: “I started smoking marijuana when I was eight – I can’t tell you I’m proud of my life, or that it’s a good place to be, even before that happened with the Mara. But even if I wanted to go back, I can’t – ever – they’d kill me in the beat of a heart.” Sitting at a concrete table are two boys from Guatemala City with whom Jonathan has teamed up, Osman and Rodrigo, themselves in flight from “poverty and violence” back home. By contrast, this place is sad but clean and organised mothers and children sit beside a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe boys play football – but it’s no more than a way station.All three at our table want to work in construction in the US, but while the Guatemalans left recently, Jonathan’s nightmare is in his adolescent past: he’s now 19, become an artful dodger and survivor of the road, trying to cross the border into America. “I’ve been in Mexico five years now, working, saving, hiding – planning the moment. The Mexicans ordered me deported twice, but I slipped the net. The trains through this country” – La Bestia – “have been my home. They’re more dangerous for women than me getting raped, kidnapped and killed. But now my time has come to cross.”With lines for asylum lengthening, and Donald Trump entrenching his hostility to migration, Jonathan has not entered the system most families here have conjoined, registering for a plastic bracelet and numbered place in the so-called metering line for an asylum hearing. “They’ve made it too difficult, and it takes too long. I’ll go alone, my own way.”Osman and Rodrigo are going illegally too “Trump has made asylum impossible – too long, and you’ll likely get turned back”, says Osman, in English. “I miss it back there my mother calls me every fucking day – it’s torture - but too dangerous to stay and there’s no future in Guatemala. I have to risk it.” Rodrigo, quieter, is more nervous: “I’ve a wife and son back home, that’s who I’m doing this for – but what if I get caught?”Word is out that migrants arriving in Ciudad Juárez stand a statistically negligible chance of asylum through El Paso compared to ports of entry into California from Tijuana where lines are therefore longer, tempting more and more to try Jonathan’s way.But El Paso’s courts are not the only menace. Juárez last year suffered a sudden surge in homicides: 1,247 – a rate of 96 per 100,000. By far the highest toll for any year since the city’s hyper-violence of 2008-2011, during which this was the most murderous metropolis in the world. Juárez now has Mexico’s second highest murder rate after Tijuana, attributed by city security and justice officials to turf wars between gangs for street-sale and cross-border smuggling of drugs.Casa del Migrante lies on the city outskirts towards the perilous Valle de Juárez, entrepôt for narco-traffic and likely route for migrants trying to cross illegally, including these boys.So acute danger faces those heading north, as traffickers hover to prey on and profit from the increased pool of potential custom, and those deported in the opposite direction, as gangs recruit their footsoldiers. The worst massacre in Mexico’s carnage since 2006 was not drug-related, but that of 72 migrants at San Fernando, Tamaulipas, in 2010, who refused or were unable to pay ‘la cuota’ – the levy. Traffickers are known in the parlance as ‘coyotes’ or ‘polleros’ – their quarry ‘pollos’, chickens.Blanca Ribera is one of two social workers at Casa del Migrante after eight years, she says, “I’ve seen all kinds come through – before mostly Mexicans, but no longer. It’s never been like this – these numbers and so desperate, people who just cannot go back.”Ribera explains that a police presence outside the chain-link fence topped with razor wire is “because of incidents at the center and to keep away polleros. It’s forbidden for migrants go to the fence and talk to polleros. If they do, and seem honest, we’ll explain the risks if they look to be doing business, they must leave. Those expelled, we do not see again.” Whether they make it or not migrant disappearances are oft-reported along the border sometimes people ask at the centre if a vanished person has been seen.But there’s a twist, according to Jonathan and almost all those who plan crossing of their own device. “The police are part of the system. We all know that,” says Jonathan. How part of this? Jonathan laughs again and makes to slice his index finger in half, “Fifty-fifty, that’s how it works. We watch the polleros watching us on the bridges and in the town, and the police allow the polleros to work on their plaza – turf – for a 50-50 cut on the money paid. If you don’t believe that, you’re an idiot. That’s partly why I stay away from them – to be apart from that shit.”Leticia Chavarría is a GP in one of Juárez’ many assembly plants who established a medical advocacy committee during the city’s most violent years and now works with the Bi-national Network for Solidarity with Migrants. “Everyone knows the crossings are managed by the polleros,” she says, “and it’s been understood that for years they’ve operated complicit with the authorities, under an accord never documented or proved. Polleros run stash houses across the city and do business openly, but are only arrested in very isolated cases”.There was no response to a request through his office to interview the mayor of Ciudad Juárez, Armando Carbada, on the policing of migrant security.The border hardens still: just east of downtown Juárez, late winter sun skates across a concrete slope down to the slow trickle of the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo on this side), and up the other bank, which is the USA, where Mexican-American workers operate a Volvo digger and trucks to build a brand new stretch of high steel fence. Wall or no wall, this new fortification – which started to the north, separating the satellite barrio of Anapra from New Mexico, under the Obama administration – began late last year under Trump, and continues.And as another caravan forms this week in Honduras, Ribera draws attention to a further, crucial, matter: resources. Circumstances combine against the running of places like Casa del Migrante not just the surge in numbers and entrenched US policy, but accession by Mexico’s new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, to a demand from Trump that asylum-seekers must wait in Mexico, not the US, for their cases to be heard.Mexico’s borderland is not yet America’s migrant waiting room, “but as the number of migrants increases, government help is reduced”, says Ribera. At Christmas, the priest who oversees Casa del Migrante, Padre Javier Calvillo, gave a rare press conference during which he lambasted Mexican federal, state and municipal authorities for failing to provide sufficient funds or manpower to help centres like this cope.“The municipality had taken 80 migrants from the bridge directly to Casa del Migrante, without any processing,” says Chavarría, “and Fr Calvillo said he could take no more. The city opened its own shelter, but it lasted a week.”“The truth is,” says Chavarría, “that when most of those going across or being deported were Mexicans, there was more interest. The attitude is that these are Central Americans, not our problem. But it is. What will they do if they cannot enter the United States? Our work, either side of the border, is to educate both migrants and our own citizens on the rights they have.”Back at Casa del Migrante, more people arrive at the heavy gates: families from Guatemala like Eder Ramírez and his daughter, Leti, age eight and two women travelling from Panajachel, with two children each, “running from the gangs”. Had they heard about two other children from their own country who died in US custody just across the river, over Christmas? No. A guard explains the rules: you must surrender your phone at reception and collect it when you leave. No weapons or drugs no Viagra, only one smoking area.Then they register, grateful for a wide smile on the volunteer’s face. Leti wants a soda from the vending machine, but there’s no cash, and they look in a storage closet for donated used clothes that might fit. Leti chooses a pink Loony Tunes hoodie.I tell Jonathan I hope his friend is grateful for what he did – or didn’t do. “He is,” he replies. “He vanished from the Mara’s sight, and is still alive.” How long can you stay here? “Three days.”How long have you been here?“Three days. I cross tomorrow night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f762f856d2306379d5fa8abf1444e76e76e5ccf3/0_333_4995_2997/master/4995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=546bd9e9e1d8972da1ee27a2e62a716c","title":"kamala harris 2020 president election run democrat senator california news","story":"Democratic senator portrays herself as a fighter for justice and equality as she enters crowded field of candidates vying to take on TrumpKamala Harris, the barrier-breaking California senator and the state’s former attorney general, has officially launched her presidential campaign for 2020, jumping into an increasingly erse Democratic field so far dominated by a new generation of women and minority candidates.Harris, the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, launched her campaign for the White House on Monday – America’s Martin Luther King Jr Day holiday – in an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America.“Let’s do this, together. Let’s claim our future. For ourselves, for our children, and for our country,” Harris , 54, said in a campaign video that was released to coincide with her appearance on the morning television show.The first-term senator portrayed herself as a fighter for justice, decency and equality in the video. “They’re the values we as Americans cherish, and they’re all on the line now,” Harris says. “The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values.”She will formally launch her campaign on Sunday at a rally in Oakland, California, the city where she was born and where she began her career as a prosector in the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office.Harris’s announcement follows the high-profile entrances of her fellow senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York as well as Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former housing secretary Juilán Castro.She may also face competition from several other senate colleagues who are also weighing presidential bids in a primary race that has no frontrunner, including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The former vice-president Joe Biden, the former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg are also considering runs. So too are home-state politicians including Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, and the California congressman Eric Swalwell.In the run-up to her campaign launch, Harris traveled the country on a book tour that she used as an opportunity to introduce herself – beginning with how to pronounce her name. “It’s ‘comma’ then add a ‘la’,” she told an audience in Washington, explaining that it means lotus in sanskrit.In the book, she casts herself as a perfect fit for this political moment. She has a compelling biography that often draws comparisons to Barack Obama mixed with a record – and plenty of viral material – of standing up to Trump on the issues that most inflamed the liberal base, from the travel ban to the Daca program for young undocumented immigrants to the Kavanaugh supreme court nomination.Harris began her career as a deputy district attorney in Alameda county, California, before becoming district attorney of San Francisco, where she focused on crime prevention. In 2010, she narrowly beat her Republican opponent to become California’s attorney general. Six years later she was easily elected to the Senate, where she became the second black woman ever to serve in the chamber.Republicans welcomed Harris to the race on Monday, by calling her “unqualified and out-of-touch”.“Kamala Harris is arguably the least vetted Democrat running for president,” Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement, adding: “All she has to show for her brief time in the Senate is a radically liberal voting record.”Since arriving in the Senate in 2016, Harris has built a reputation for bringing a prosecutorial style of questioning to hearings with Trump nominees. In a combative exchange with the former attorney general Jeff Sessions, he said her rushed questions were making him “nervous”.While the skills she honed in the courtroom have served her well in the Senate – and helped to elevate her to the forefront of the anti-Trump resistance movement – progressives have lingering and serious questions about her career as California’s “top cop”.A recent op-ed published in the New York Times by University of San Francisco law professor, Lara Bazelon, accuses the senator of having been “often on the wrong side of history” when she served as the state’s attorney general. She pointed to her support of an initiative that threatened the parents of habitually truant elementary school children with jail time. She also defended a prosecutor who falsified testimony, only relenting after the case attracted national attention.Harris has highlighted other aspects of her record. She touts Back on Track, a program instituted while she was the DA in San Francisco, which allowed first-time nonviolent drug offenders a chance to have their charges dismissed if they completed vocational training. And in her book she recounts a “shouting match” she had over the phone with the JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon during the foreclosure crisis: “I took off my earrings (the Oakland in me) and picked up the receiver.” It’s an anecdote certain to draw wild applause from anti-Wall Street liberals on the stump.During the 2018 midterm elections, Harris campaigned on behalf of several women and minority candidates. She is aligned with many of her colleagues and the other contenders on policy, including her support for Medicare-for-All-style healthcare. And like several of the early entrants, Harris has vowed not to accept donations from corporate political-action committees, a pledge that is gaining traction among Democratic voters.With relatively minor policy differences among the potential Democratic contenders, the party’s months-long primary is likely to revolve around questions of identity, electoral strategy and style as as much as ideology. Voters will choose who they believe is best suited to take on Trump and who can appeal to the party’s many constituencies, which include white rural voters, young people, college-educated women and people of color."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c938ca42fba9d607c07d4d7fa6a064f19762f0c8/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=181f4846db1ffcb7b7d1d54a7b7dc7ce","title":"kamala harris 2020 president election run meteoric rise","story":"Longtime California colleagues, friends, and political rivals tell of an unmatched ambition that could take her to the White Houseby  Vivian Ho in San FranciscoBefore Trump, before the Kavanaugh hearings, the book tour, the “she’s running” memes, the California senator Kamala Harris sat in St Mary’s Cathedral in San Francisco amid a sea of blue-uniformed police officers.The year was 2004, just a few months into Harris’s first term as San Francisco district attorney – her first elected position. A young police officer, Isaac Espinoza, had been gunned down on the job, and the city’s rank-and-file were out for blood.Harris had unseated the incumbent (albeit unpopular) district attorney in part by campaigning to not seek capital punishment. Three days before the funeral at St Mary’s, Harris announced that she intended to keep her campaign promise, much to the fury of the police. But as she sat in the cathedral, the woman who would later become her colleague, Senator Dianne Feinstein, veered from the script and called for the death penalty, prompting thousands of officers to their feet.To this day, some city police officers will still clench their teeth when Harris’s name comes up in conversation, recalling what they describe as a betrayal 15 years prior.But Harris took the political hit. She stayed the course, as she always had in her meteoric rise in San Francisco and California politics. Her career has been dotted with moments like the one in St Mary’s, but her track record shows that she has grand ambitions and a plan on how to achieve them, making both friends and enemies along the way.And now, as she eyes the highest office in the land, few doubt her ability to eventually get where she wants to go.“Nobody works harder than Kamala Harris,” said Lateefah Simon, Harris’s longtime friend. “She’s a strategist. She has a memory like nobody you’ll ever meet. But more than that, I think she cares. She cares about what happens in the lives of the people in our community.”San Francisco has long been considered a liberal bastion, but it’s taken time for the city’s power structure to reflect the ersity of the people. But until Harris was elected district attorney in 2003, only white men had held that office. Born in Oakland in 1964, at the height of the Bay Area’s anti-war and civil rights activism, she was bussed to an elementary school in Berkeley as “part of a national experiment in desegregation”, according to her political memoir, The Truths We Hold.Her parents – Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian immigrant, and Donald Harris, who was born in Jamaica – would often bring her to marches and protests at UC Berkeley.After her parents orced, Harris and her younger sister, Maya, who would go on to become a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, were primarily raised by their mother. Harris attended high school in Montreal, where her mother had a job teaching at McGill University, and went on to study at Howard University before returning to the Bay Area for law school at UC Hastings.There, she met Jeff Adachi. Later on, as the city’s public defender, he would face off with Harris as her chief in-court adversary when she became the city’s top prosecutor. But at UC Hastings, he was just a tutor.“Even then, she was an extremely talented, charismatic person who had a very strong ambition. That was something that struck me right away,” Adachi said. “She was always a people person, as she is now, but always very focused on whatever it was that she wanted.”In her last summer in law school, she went on to intern at the Alameda county district attorney’s office, where she spent a few years after she passed the bar. She later went on to the San Francisco district attorney’s office as a line prosecutor, eventually taking over the office’s career criminal unit.“I remember asking her why she wanted to be a prosecutor,” Adachi said, “and she said, ‘That’s how I’m going to change the world.’”In 1994, Harris met then-state assembly speaker Willie Brown, a controversial figure in California politics.Back then, he was called the “Ayatollah of the Assembly”. In San Francisco, a city defined by its great wealth and even greater economic disparities in part because of its rich history of political back-scratching, he’d go on to be known by many names: “Da Mayor” (he was mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004) the kingmaker the puppetmaster.Anybody in Brown’s orbit is considered part of the Willie Brown machine – which, depending on who you ask, is either merely an influential, moderate-leaning branch of the California Democratic party, a self-serving cartel with the lobbying and fundraising skills to make or break careers, or both.Brown’s proteges soar high, but the whispers follow. This rang especially true for Harris, who dated Brown for about a year. He was 60 and she was 29. During this time, Brown appointed her to the state Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the California Medical Assistance Commission, both high-paying positions.Many politicians owe their success to Brown. He launched the careers of California governor Gavin Newsom, the former California state senator Mark Leno, and the former San Francisco mayor Ed Lee, but when discussing Harris, the talk gets particularly nasty, in part because of their romantic history.Harris has spent much of the past 25 years distancing herself from Brown – she doesn’t mention him once in her political memoir. But much like he did for Newsom and Leno, Brown opened doors. And when it came time for her to run for district attorney after a stint working in the city attorney’s office, she won.“In those days, when you were supported by Willie Brown, it came with all the support and money of the San Francisco establishment,” said Aaron Peskin, a current member of the San Francisco board of supervisors.“I was an early enthusiast for Kamala Harris for district attorney, even though I’m a self-professed leftie and she came from the Willie Brown moderates,” Peskin said. “All things being equal, I’d rather have a district attorney that is independent of the mayor (Brown was still mayor at the time Harris was elected). Mayors want to have influence over the legislative body, but how often do mayors call upon the district attorney?”Harris ran for district attorney at a contentious time for the office. The incumbent, Terence Hallinan, a prominent progressive, had unsuccessfully tried to indict the entire command staff of the San Francisco police department.Hallinan was unpopular, but it was still shocking for a first-time candidate to beat out not just a sitting official, but also a serial candidate for district attorney, Bill Fazio.“She had a lot of support,” said Fazio, a former prosecutor and the third candidate in the race. “She was a new face, an attractive candidate, and I don’t just mean in a physical sense. For San Francisco, she fit in well. She had connections through Willie Brown. She was introduced to a lot of moneyed people.”Harris had campaigned on the promise to repair relations between her office and the embattled police department – and then, on her 100th day in office, there she was in St Mary’s Cathedral, watching as thousands of cops cheered against her. Peskin had attended the funeral and remained seated as well, and remembered seeing her a few rows in front him, her face ashen.“It was so hard and painful,” said Lateefah Simon, Harris’s longtime friend. “She was new to the office and she had always been clear: she was anti-death penalty. But you know, I never saw Kamala bow her head down in any kind of shame. I think during this time, she began to deeply understand the power of her voice and how she could move through situations.”A few months later, Harris called Simon up and asked her if she wanted to run her re-entry services. Simon told Harris it would be risky to hire her, “a teen mom with no college degree”. (Simon is selling herself short here – she is the youngest women to receive the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship). But Harris refused to let Simon settle, and part of her employment agreement included the requirement to get her degree. “She made me show her my report cards!” Simon laughed.“Listen, Kamala Harris is the toughest person that you’ll ever work for,” Simon said. “She is just a zealot about public service, and it’s intense. But everybody who works for Kamala is forever transformed. I know it’s not just me. There were many others.”Harris regularly put in 12- to 14-hour days, talking to victims’ families “and promising them justice”, Simon said. She held her employees to high standards, but herself to even higher ones.“One day, she had a really bad cold,” Simon said. “It was like the flu. She had tissues, but she was still impeccably dressed, and she had a bowl of clementines on her impeccably organized desk. It was like 4.50pm pm. I said, ‘Ms Harris’ – because I always called her Ms Harris when I worked for her – ‘it’s almost quitting time, and you’re sick.’ She took a sip of water, looked at those bowls of clementines and then looked me dead in the eyes and said, ‘I don’t get sick.’”Harris has received criticism for her record as district attorney, for which she was re-elected in 2007. While Harris has been outspoken about her progressive values on police reform and criminal justice, her critics say her time as district attorney does not reflect that.“In many respects, she was a traditional prosecutor, concerned with conviction rates and victims’ rights,” Adachi said. “This was before the criminal justice reform movement and Black Lives Matter had really taken hold, and she pretty much ran the office as you would expect a prosecutor to run an office. But she was also open to programs that helped iniduals turn their lives around.”One of the biggest missteps of her tenure as district attorney arose as she was running for attorney general in 2010. Ahead of the primary, the San Francisco police department became embroiled in a scandal. A criminalist at the department admitted to regularly stealing cocaine from evidence. The woman also implicated other analysts in poor investigative work, resulting in the dismissal of hundreds of pending cases.A superior court judge pilloried Harris’s office in a scathing ruling on the case and essentially accused her office of violating defendants’ constitutional rights by not informing them of the issues, as prosecutors are obligated to.Entering the race with this scandal hanging overhead, the odds were against Harris.Yet she won. The race was so close that it was not until three weeks after the election and the provisional ballots were counted that the former Los Angeles county district attorney Steve Cooley conceded.“You got to remember, Kamala Harris is all politics all the time,” Cooley said. “There’s no question when it comes to being a politician, she is very committed and hardworking, whereas I was a career prosecutor. I never perceived myself as a politician.”Nine years later, Cooley still expresses some bitterness over the loss, and Harris’s criminal justice record, saying that he’s heard from “many elected DAs” around the state who believe she was “the worst attorney general ever”.But underneath the bitterness is a begrudging respect.“She looked at everything she did as DA from a political prism,” he said. “Attorney general is a pretty powerful position in California. I think when she was DA, she was already looking at it as the next step up the ladder. Watch her now. She’s in the Senate and now apparently she’s going for president.”He laughed. “I’ll hand that to her. Her ambition is without equal.”Ambitious women get a bad rep in this world, especially ambitious politicians who are women, and Harris and her supporters have heard it all. Calculating. Untrustworthy. Unlikable. “This is what happens when you have a dynamic and gifted woman of color who goes into her job and does her job,” Simon said.Bill Fazio, the attorney who Harris defeated in her first race for district attorney, still balks when he hears people describe Harris as “guarded” or “cold” because he knows that she is anything but that.In March 2009, Fazio’s wife died and out of the blue, he received a call from Harris. “Her mom passed away about the same time, and she was very close to her mom.” Fazio said. “All she wanted to do was to talk about our personal losses in a very personal way.”He continued: “People always call me up thinking I’m going to trash her. But I still feel really positive about her.”In a prime example of the insular and small-world nature of San Francisco politics, the San Francisco supervisor Aaron Peskin and Harris had not only attended Thousand Oaks Elementary School together in Berkeley, but were in the same class from kindergarten through third grade. “Her mother was Shyamala, from India, and my mother was Tsipora, from what was then-Palestine, now Israel,” Peskin said. “It’s a total Bay Area story.”When Peskin’s father died in April, he was surprised to get a text message from Harris containing a snapshot of a class book they had put together as kids with the message: “Thinking of you.”It’s telling that even her former adversaries are reluctant to speak too badly of her, in part because many believe that like every other goal she’s met in her life, she’s destined for higher office, whether in this race or the next.But for more, there’s an aspect of game recognizing game. No matter the criticism of Harris, no one can deny that she stayed the course, in a time when few have the necessary discipline, dedication, or political know-how to do so.“She didn’t come from a place of privilege or money,” said Adachi, the public defender. “She wasn’t a Kennedy. She had to work hard to get to where she is. A lot of people say she coasted into the Senate position. No, it was because of the political capital she built from those other races. And since then, she has been able to take the political capital, and amplify it. And she’ll do it for every office she’ll run for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9acc34d5e5ac70af556fa6bde0d937f8566c646/0_228_3878_2326/master/3878.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d192135cdc5c0b1c81f3b4a92b707516","title":"greenland ice melting faster than scientists previously thought study","story":"The pace of ice loss has increased four-fold since 2003 as enormous glaciers are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts, causing sea levels to riseGreenland is melting faster than scientists previously thought, with the pace of ice loss increasing four-fold since 2003, new research has found.Enormous glaciers in Greenland are depositing ever larger chunks of ice into the Atlantic ocean, where it melts. But scientists have found that the largest ice loss in the decade from 2003 actually occurred in the southwest region of the island, which is largely glacier-free.This suggests surface ice is simply melting as global temperatures rise, causing gushing rivers of meltwater to flow into the ocean and push up sea levels. South-west Greenland, not previously thought of as a source of woe for coastal cities, is set to “become a major future contributor to sea level rise,” the research states.“We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers,” said Michael Bevis, lead author of the paper and a professor of geodynamics at Ohio State University. “But now we recognize a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea.”The research provides fresh evidence of the dangers posed to vulnerable coastal places as erse as Miami, Shanghai, Bangladesh and various Pacific islands as climate change shrinks the world’s land-based ice.“The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming – it’s too late for there to be no effect,” Bevis said. “This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point.“We’re going to see faster and faster sea level rise for the foreseeable future. Once you hit that tipping point, the only question is: How severe does it get?”The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used data from Nasa’s gravity recovery and climate experiment (known as Grace) and GPS stations scattered across Greenland to analyze changes in ice mass.This showed that Greenland lost around 280bn tons of ice per year between 2002 and 2016, enough to raise the worldwide sea level by 0.03 inches annually. If all of Greenland’s vast ice sheet, 3km thick in places, was to melt, global sea levels would rise by seven meters, or more than 20ft, drowning most coastal settlements.The rate of loss hasn’t been even, however, with the ice melting four times faster in 2013 compared to 2003. Researchers said this was driven by rising global temperatures from human-induced climate change as well as the North Atlantic Oscillation, a periodic weather phenomenon that brings warmer air to western Greenland.The fate of Greenland’s huge glaciers in the south-east and north-west has long been viewed as a key factor in global sea level rise but the Ohio State-led research suggests the ice fields of the island’s southwest may prove an unexpectedly large source of meltwater.Scientists have been gaining a greater understanding of how the two massive ice masses on the planet, in Greenland and Antarctica, are reacting to a warming ocean and atmosphere.Antarctica is becoming an increasing concern, however, with ice vanishing at its fastest rate in recorded history. The world’s largest expanse of ice is now losing around 219bn tonnes of ice a year, a trajectory that would contribute more than 25cm to total global sea level rise by 2070. Should the entire west Antarctic ice sheet collapse, sea levels would balloon by around 3.5m, albeit over a lengthy timeframe.“We are warming the planet, this is melting ice, and that is raising sea level,” said Richard Alley, a geologist and glacier expert at Pennsylvania State University. Alley added that while there are uncertainties over future sea level rise “if the big ice sheets change more rapidly than expected, they could drive faster or much faster rise than expected”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a143da9315d03cf5b8bbdc6d14c198030f69bbd/0_121_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c6d9c57a0f183054507a493c65a4701","title":"nicaraguan journalist carlos fernando chamorro flees to costa rica ortega","story":"Carlos Fernando Chamorro goes into exile citing President Ortega’s media crackdownNicaragua’s best-known journalist has gone into exile after armed police raided and ransacked his newsroom in what experts called the latest chapter of the country’s slide into autocracy under President Daniel Ortega.Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the editor of Confidencial, a combative newsletter and website and a member of one of Nicaragua’s most influential families, announced his decision on Sunday.Chamorro wrote: “I will continue to fulfil my duties as a journalist from Costa Rica … investigating and denouncing the crimes, corruption and the impunity and documenting the terminal crisis of this dictatorship.”He blamed his decision on the “extreme threats” he and other Nicaraguan journalists were facing as a result of an intensifying press crackdown being waged by the country’s Sandinista leader.He claimed leaving Nicaragua – where Ortega has been struggling to regain control since a destabilising and deadly period of political upheaval began last April – was the only way to ensure his “physical integrity and freedom”.Throughout Nicaragua’s ongoing crisis, Chamorro has repeatedly insisted he would not be forced from the country.“I’m here and here I will remain,” he told the  last month after his offices in the capital, Managua, were stormed and occupied by police. However, the assault on the media has continued to gather pace despite international condemnation.Last week, Nicaragua’s biggest newspaper, La Prensa, printed an almost blank front page in protest at the government’s apparent attempt to silence it by impounding printing materials.Suggested front-page headlines included: “They want to silence us but you can’t silence the truth”, “SOS Nicaragua” and “Nicaragua declares itself a territory free of Orteguismo”.Another headline celebrated the nine-month-old anti-Ortega movement with the rallying cry: “Insist, persist, resist and never desist!”In the article announcing his exile, Chamorro called on Nicaraguan citizens to continue using social media to challenge Ortega and vowed to continue his own journalism from Costa Rica, home to a sizeable and growing Nicaraguan exile community.“I am confident that better days lie ahead for Nicaragua,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c52d390452fbf966c421c7a8d322f4fed6483a/0_736_1350_809/master/1350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=378e407af53d8b5cad13e7fe344dff10","title":"venezuela claims foiled attempted military uprising","story":"Government says 27 national guardsmen have been arrested and accuses ‘shadowy interests’ of launching insurrectionVenezuela’s government has claimed to have foiled what appeared to be an attempted military insurrection, blaming the mutiny on “shadowy interests of the extreme right”.In a statement, Venezuela accused a small group of “assailants” from the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) of “betraying their oath of loyalty to the homeland” by kidnapping four officials in an attempt to steal weapons that began at about 2.50am local time (0650 GMT) on Monday.The apparent uprising appeared to have been small-scale, but it is the latest sign of resistance to Venezuela’s embattled president, Nicolás Maduro, who took power after Hugo Chávez’s death in 2013 and has led his country into an economic slump and a humanitarian crisis.Diosdado Cabello, a leading chavista (supporter of Chávez) who is widely seen as a possible successor to Maduro, said: “Our Bolivarian armed forces will respond to attacks against the homeland … wherever they come from.“The group of robbers have been neutralised, subdued and captured, in record time, and are already confessing the details.”He added that 27 guardsmen were arrested and more could be detained as the investigation unfolded.Earlier, videos circulating on social media showed a group of armed, uniformed men promising to “re-establish the constitutional order”.A man who identifies himself as 3Sgt Alexander Bandres Figueroa tells viewers: “Get out on to the streets … It is today. It’s today … People, get out, support us.“This fight is for you, for Venezuela,” he adds in a second video entitled “Message to the glorious people of Venezuela from part of its patriotic armed forces”.Exactly what unfolded overnight remained unclear on Monday. But the newspaper El Nacional said residents of San José de Cotiza, in northern Caracas, reported hearing explosions and a confrontation, apparently between members of the group and police special forces, at about 4am.Local television stations also reported clashes between protesters and security forces on Monday morning. “We want a better Venezuela … we want freedom,” one woman is filmed telling a reporter as fellow dissenters gather around her chanting “Freedom, freedom”.Luisa Ortega Díaz, Venezuela’s exiled former chief prosecutor, tweeted her support for the “young patriots” she said were behind the revolt: “The bravery of these national guard boys shows us that yes there is dignity and willpower in the barracks to get us out of tyranny … We must support military rebellion.”Maduro began his second term as president on 10 January, despite a chorus of international condemnation. But he will face renewed pressure this week, with opposition leaders calling for nationwide protests on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of a 1958 uprising that brought down the rightwing dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez.In recent weeks, Guaidó, the president of Venezuela’s national assembly, has emerged as a key figure in attempts to unseat Maduro, with the Brazilian, Colombian and US governments offering him their support.Writing in the Washington Post last week, Guaidó denounced Maduro as a “usurper” and called on the military – whose members are being offered amnesty by Venezuela’s opposition – to turn on him. “The chain of command has been broken and there’s no commander in chief – it’s time to get on the right side of history,” he wrote."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765778.1548095221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"griffith avenue apartments in clear breach of height limits","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA construction worker on a Cairn Homes construction site in Dublin, 2016. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergPlans for almost 380 apartments in seven blocks up to eight storeys tall on Griffith Avenue would break Dublin City Council height thresholds by more than 60 per cent, it has emerged.The application by Cairn Homes to build on a three-hectare site previously owned by the Christian Brothers is the first major housing development in the city to take advantage of Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy’s decision to scrap height caps last December.Cairn has made its application directly to the board under the fast-track process for large housing developments. Under the Strategic Housing Development system, applications for schemes of more than 100 homes, or blocks of 200 student bed spaces, are made directly to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing the local authority decision phase.However, the relevant local authority must submit a report to the board setting out its view, and the view of the councillors on the development.Councillors were yesterday told the Griffith Avenue development, at up to 26m or eight storeys, would breach the maximum height allowable for the area by 10m. However, the council’s planning department said this threshold had been “superseded” by new guidelines issued by the Department of Housing last December, which removed caps on building height.Planner Carol Smyth told councillors that although the new height guidelines “trump” the council’s rules, the council had informed the developer the scheme was in contravention of its development plan. The submission the council would make to the board would reflect its views on whether the scheme met the council’s objectives for the area and whether the height of the development would have a detrimental impact on access to sunlight and daylight, whether there might be “microclimate impacts”, and whether it was justified by proximity to a transport hub, she said.However, councillors said they wanted it made explicit they did not support the breach of the city development plan’s height rules.“The scale of the apartment buildings is totally out of character with the area and would inappropriately dominate this stretch of Griffith Avenue. The height is way in excess of that provided for in the development plan. Regardless of what the Minister and his department say, the height should at least comply with the development plan,” Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney said.Fine Gael councillor Naoise Ó Muirí said the city development plan “is my bible”, and must be defended. “This is a clear breach of height. I am not happy to throw the development plan out. I think we should defend it.”Independent councillor Damien O’Farrell said the development, which had more than three times the number of homes than a previous plan for the site, would have a serious impact on traffic, yet the developers had submitted a traffic analysis that was six years old “that is simply not acceptable”.Councillors also heard that the development would require the felling of three mature lime trees on Griffith Avenue and the construction phase would take three years.Observations on the plans can be made until February 1st. The council’s submission must be lodged by February 22nd."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765916.1548109074!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foetal anomaly cases require teams of doctors","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA multidisciplinary team was constituted at the Coombe hospital in Dublin earlier this month to consider the case of a patient whose foetus had been diagnosed with a foetal anomaly. File photograph: Getty ImagesDecisions on whether or not to provide terminations in cases of foetal anomaly should be reached by multidisciplinary teams of doctors on a consensus basis, newly prepared guidelines indicate.The multidisciplinary team (MDT) should be a formally-constituted committee of the hospital whose decisions are documented in clinical notes, according to the guidelines from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.One such MDT was constituted at the Coombe hospital in Dublin earlier this month to consider the case of a patient whose foetus had been diagnosed with a foetal anomaly. The case was raised by two Opposition TDs in the Dáil last week after the woman’s request for a termination was refused.In the Coombe case, treating doctors found that despite the presence of a “complex foetal anomaly” they did not believe the condition affecting the foetus was likely to lead to its death either before, or within 28 days of, birth – as required by legislation on terminations in cases of fatal foetal anomaly.The MDT recommended a re-evaluation of the clinical condition of the foetus after four weeks.According to the institute’s guidelines, a foetal medicine specialist should be involved once a diagnosis of fatal foetal anomaly is made. “These cases are subsequently discussed by the MDT at the tertiary site (large teaching hospital) to reach a consensus about the diagnosis and prognosis, and to consider the option of termination of pregnancy being discussed with the parents, as well as any implications for maternal health where the pregnancy is ongoing.”Appropriate investigations may need to be agreed by an MDT, and input by neonatologists may be necessary to agree on prognosis, the guidelines state.Fatal foetal anomalies have an “almost certain” diagnosis and prognosis, including “a very high chance of death” in the womb or by 28 days of life, despite medical treatment, they state.“It is good practice to ensure that foetal medicine MDT discussions should form an important component of the assessment of foetal anomalies, their prognosis and outcomes.”OEIS, the condition affecting the foetus of the woman who unsuccessfully sought a termination last week at the Coombe hospital, is a serious but not necessarily fatal complex of medical issues.First identified in the 1970s, it occurs in about one out of 200,000 pregnancies, and one in 400,000 live births.A syndrome composed of four parts, OEIS stands for Omphalocele, Exstrophy of the bladder and rectum, Imperforate anus and Spinal Defects. The seriousness of a particular case will vary according to how serious the inidual elements of the syndrome are.The omphalocele involves organs protruding from the abdomen this can vary from a portion of the intestine to a number of organs including the spleen, liver and full intestine.With exstrophy of the bladder and rectum, the bladder in the womb is on the outside of the body and split into two halves. The colon and rectum are also open with a segment of the rectum situated between the halves of the bladder.An imperforate anus is a congenital birth defect in which the opening to the anus is missing or blocked, and the baby cannot pass stools normally.Serious as these conditions sound, they are often operable. Doctors treat the condition with a series of surgeries over time. Soon after birth, surgeons repair the omphalocele by closing the bladder halves and carrying out a colostomy procedure. Hip surgery may be carried out to bring together the child’s pelvis in support of the bladder. Bowel, urinary and genital surgery may also be required.However, OEIS also involves spinal defects, such as spina bifida, whose seriousness can vary hugely from case to case and may ultimately determine the overall prognosis. “The goals of treatment include an anatomic reconstruction and achieving bowel and urinary control, as well as normal sexual function,” according to Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, which offers specialist services to families affected by the condition.In the Coombe case, ultrasound findings were “consistent with OEIS”, doctors found.

Just over 7,800 Dutch men and women aged between 68 and 70 provided information in 1986 on their weight at that time and on their weight and height when they were 20, along with details of their physical activity during leisure time, including walking or cycling to work, sports, gardening and dog-walking.Participants were monitored until they died or turned 90, whichever came first. Some 433 men, or 17 per cent, and 944 women, or 34 per cent, reached 90. Women who were still alive by that age were on average taller, had weighed less at the start of the study and had put on less weight since they were 20 years old than those who were shorter and heavier. There were no similar findings for men.The study also found that greater physical activity results in a longer life but not for both sexes.The more time men spent being physically active every day, the better their chances of reaching old age for women, 60 minutes of physical activity every day gave them the best chance of celebrating their 90th birthday, but they got no further benefit for being more physically active. Men who clocked up more than 90 minutes a day on physical activity were 39 per cent more likely to reach 90 than those who did less than 30 minutes. Every additional 30 minutes of daily activity brought a 5 per cent increase in the chances of a man reaching old age.

An investigation has been launched into the previously unreported incident, which occurred on November 6th. The ferry was Stena Superfast VII, which operates between Northern Ireland and Scotland. It has a capacity for 1,300 passengers and 660 cars. The submarine was submerged at the depth needed to extend its periscope above the surface of the water. The Royal Navy would not confirm which of its 10 submarines was involved.They are all nuclear-powered but only four carry Trident nuclear missiles. “We have carried out a preliminary assessment of the evidence in this case and the Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents has decided to open a safety investigation. “The investigation is being conducted with the full co-operation of the Royal Navy. A report will be published when our investigation has concluded.” A navy spokesman said: “We can confirm the sighting of a Royal Navy submarine between Belfast and Stranraer on November 6th, 2018.

The incident is now under investigation by the MAIB and we will of course co-operate fully in this.” – Press Association"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765708.1548098450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sligo on brexit now it feels more like a game of russian roulette","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSabine Walsh and Noel Mulkeen at the Build Block business centre in Sligo. Photograph: Brian FarrellHaving opened a new Ford car dealership in Castlebaldwin, Co Sligo, in August, brothers David and Ray Porter are acutely aware of how the Brexit-inspired slump in the value of sterling is affecting the Irish motor trade.When they were setting up the business, the brothers approached a number of dealers in Northern Ireland and told them they would be in the market for a supply of cars if they got a good price.“They said: ‘Why would we price them well for you when we have busloads of people coming up every weekend to look at cars?’ ” says David, an accountant by profession. The trip across the Border to window-shop for cars, once sterling started to slide, had become a regular outing for many in the Republic, he believes.“It was a day out where you’d go to the North, do some shopping, get some alcohol, buy a car,” he says.The trend is reflected in statistics for last year, which saw a record 100,755 used imports being registered in the Republic (up 7.8 per cent on 2017). That compared with total new car sales in 2018 of 125,486 (down 4.4 per cent on the previous year).In Co Sligo there were more imports registered last year than new sales – 1,355 compared with 1,085.As far as the Porters are concerned, the biggest impact of Brexit so far is that people are hesitating to opt for a new car, mainly because the trade-in value of their old car is being affected by the huge volume of imports. “I can’t, for example, value a trade-in at €10,000 if someone beside me can import and sell something similar from the UK for €8,000,” says David.Another reason why the motor industry is so vulnerable to Brexit , he points out, is that there are so few countries in the EU where motorists drive on the left. “We clearly cannot replace imports from the UK with imports from France.”He doesn’t believe the Government can do much more than it has been doing in the build-up to Brexit. “I think the Irish Government is in a difficult position, to be honest. I think absolutely there should be a backstop agreement by now. It is the middle of January and this is happening at the end of March, so a backstop agreement should exist.”The accountant’s gut feeling is that there will not be a “crash-out”in March as the stakes are too high for everyone.“In 2016 I was not that concerned as I thought the issue so big there would have to be a resolution. But now, as it comes closer to March, it feels more like a game of Russian roulette.”In the Building Block co-working hub in Sligo town, many in the tech sector seem unsure what Brexit will mean. Conflict resolution is Sabine Walsh’s speciality and she reckons it’s a skill that is sorely lacking in politics across the water. She work for London-based company Mediator Academy, which provides online courses in conflict resolution to clients around the world.“The uncertainty is the worst aspect,” says the qualified solicitor.“I don’t criticise the Irish Government. I don’t think there is much they can do because they don’t know what they are planning for. But the adversarial nature of the politics we see in Britain is what gets me.”Her personal background makes her worry about the future. “I am half German, and my entire childhood was about how the whole point of the EU was that the Holocaust would never happen again.”She believes a hard border would be “catastrophic” and would “play into hands of populists and nationalists”.As someone married to a sheep farmer, she also knows how concerned that sector is. “We have no idea what the implications are. I don’t think people realise the level of trade between Ireland and the UK on a day-to-day basis.”While a new regulatory framework will affect her work in London, she is even more worried about the implications for “peace and prosperity”.“People had started to take peace, security and prosperity for granted and have forgotten that 80 years ago the English and the Germans were killing each other,” she says.“And we take a lot for granted in terms of travel. I am sure a lot of people who voted for Brexit will still want to have their beach holidays in Spain.”She believes the Government must continue to push for a backstop. “I do not think people outside the island of Ireland really realise how fragile the peace in the North is and how easily that could erupt again. There is still no functioning assembly in Stormont because the DUP are too busy propping up the UK government.“I grew up in an era where every time you crossed the Border into Northern Ireland, people were shoving machines guns in our face. It is really not that long ago, and it is not going to take much to ide the community up there again.”Denise Mulvaney, a native of Grange, Co Sligo, had been working in the tech sector in London for 10 years but handed in her notice on the day the result of the Brexit referendum was announced. Although the exact timing was a coincidence, she had been feeling uneasy in London in the lead-up to the referendum.“There was a weird atmosphere,” she says. “I love London but it was a very stressful atmosphere because of the uncertainty.”The day she made the decision to return to Ireland, she was making her usual dash to pick up her child from childcare when there was an announcement that her train was cancelled because of a fatality on the track. Looking back, she believes that as the build-up to Brexit moved up a gear, suicides on the tube line started becoming much more frequent. “There was a few a month on my line alone.”She also noted an anti-immigrant attitude, even in her own office. “People would tell me I was not a ‘real’ immigrant because I was Irish, but they would say negative things about colleagues,” she says. “I felt the media was getting people to pick on each other. I felt we were all being played like puppets.”Mulvaney, a UX (user experience) consultant who describes herself as a problem solver for the tech industry, came home in August 2016 and set up her own company, Astara Creative. Since then lots of Irish expats have sought her advice about making the same move.She understands the interest but is not convinced that Brexit will be quite the horror story many are predicting. “I keep thinking of the millennium bug and all the media hype around that and the dire warnings, but our microwaves and our alarms clocks were still working at a minute past midnight.”She is not overly confident about the Government’s approach. “I struggle with the Government anyway on issues such as how they treat our civil servants and our nurses. And I do not feel Ireland has a loud enough voice in Europe I don’t feel they are representing the passion of the Irish people on this.”Noel Mulkeen, whose company, Uni.cam, produces videos for the education sector in the UK, Ireland and Germany, says some prospective British clients seemed “shell-shocked” following the vote in the House of Commons last week. “Much of their funding is EU-reliant and the uncertainty means their ability to budget and plan is seriously curtailed.”This obviously has implications for his company. As someone who benefited from the EU in both his personal and professional life, he has other concerns. “I studied in Sweden, met my wife there and my children are back and forth. We are Europeans. Britain pulling out of that culture is a backward step. But I believe that the people who voted for Brexit and for Trump did so because they felt hard done by. People felt neglected.”He thinks the Government has been right to press for the backstop. “From what I have seen they are doing a good job. My concern would be that they may have not done enough preparatory work for a crash-out. But I still think that is unlikely to happen and that there will be an extension rather than a crash out and it will drag on for six or 12 months.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Robert GhementIreland and Germany have dismissed a proposal from Poland’s foreign minister to break the Brexit deadlock with a five-year limit on the Irish backstop.The proposal by Jacek Czaputowicz marked the first time an EU minister has broken rank on the issue, but senior Polish sources told The  the minister was not speaking for the government in Warsaw.The Polish foreign minister told the Rzeczpospolita newspaper that Ireland could solve the backstop dilemma by asking the EU to amend the UK withdrawal agreement so that the backstop would apply temporarily.“Let’s say five years – the matter would be solved,” he said. “It would obviously be less favourable for Ireland than an indefinite backstop, but much more advantageous than no-deal Brexit.”Mr Czaputowicz said London and Dublin were “playing chicken” over the Border and risked a “head-on collision” in which Ireland stood to “lose the most”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney knocked back his Polish counterpart’s proposal swiftly, saying: “Putting a time limit on an insurance mechanism – which is what the backstop is – effectively means it is not a backstop at all.”Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas played down the Polish idea, saying he “completely” backed Mr Coveney.“He has already said what he thinks of it, which is nothing,” said Mr Maas.Sources in Dublin said Mr Czaputowicz raised a time-limited backstop with Mr Coveney directly when the pair met in Dublin last month.Mr Coveney rejected the idea at the time and did so again on Monday. It is understood Mr Czaputowicz repeated the call in a face-to-face encounter with the Tánaiste on the margins of a foreign affairs ministers meeting in Brussels, and suggested both a five-year and 10-year limit on the backstop.The Polish minister, in his job a year, has an academic background, and teaching colleagues described him on Monday as “an academic, making an academic argument”.Warsaw political observers say he is an outsider in Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) with no political base and little connection to Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of the party – and effectively the country.“I doubt if Kaczynski knows about this – or cares,” said Eugeniusz Smolar of the Centre for International Relations.“Czaputowicz has no influence in PiS and he merely put on the table a problem that is there but which is not up to Poland to solve.”Nevertheless, the Polish minister’s remarks strained nerves already stretched in Dublin as British prime Theresa May presented her Brexit Plan B in London.Mrs May sought to reassure MPs that they would be given “a proper say and fuller involvement” in establishing the UK’s position in negotiations on future relations with the EU.The government would consult the Commons on its negotiating mandate and regularly update the House during talks, she promised.And she said the government would offer private and confidential briefings to backbench select committees to ensure MPs are kept up-to-date on the progress of talks without undermining the UK’s position.Earlier, a senior member of Angela Merkel’s government, industry minister Peter Altmaier, warned against trying the EU’s patience for political reasons.“Sympathy, patience and readiness to wait until the UK’s position will be clarified are of utmost important to avoid the worst,” said Mr Altmaier.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Maxwellphotography.ieThe joint session of the Dáil and Seanad was scheduled to begin after The Quality had left. It wouldn’t do to make a show of themselves in front of the President of Ireland on such a historic day for the nation.But once Michael D had spoken briefly for half an hour and the declarations and reflections were out of the way, the Ceann Comhairle was free to belt his silver bell and let loose today’s TDs for a lively parliamentary session marking the centenary of the first meeting of Dáil Éireann.As a special concession (because they didn’t actually exist on the day), members of Seanad Éireann were also invited to join in so they won’t be complaining for the next 100 years about being left out.Those compelling black-and-white photographs of that first day back in 1919 had us spoiled, still pulsating with energy, excitement and danger down all the decades. And the crowd scenes are amazing – inside and out, people pressed against the gates, blocking Dawson Street, or spilling over the balcony in the Mansion House above the packed rows on the floor.Oireachtas staff worked hard to transform the Round Room, where that First Dáil met, to lend an early 20th-century atmosphere to the surroundings. It looked great. There can’t be a bolt of blue velvet left in the country because the entire balcony, much of the walls and the Ceann Comhairle’s platform were lavishly draped with heavy, gold-fringed swags.It complemented the St Patrick’s blue (Ireland’s national colour) of the carpet. The lighting mimicked gas light and some relics of the Dáil’s past, if not quite from the opening era, added to the period feel.Former taoisigh in attendance included Enda Kenny (still a TD), Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen – who was escorted by former senator Donie Cassidy. Former tánaiste and Labour leader Eamon Gilmore was seated between former ceann comhairle Rory O’Hanlon and Mary Coughlan, who served as tánaiste between 2008 and 2011. One of her colleagues from that administration, John O’Donoghue, sat nearby.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar led the current crop of party leaders, TDs and Senators. Seating was in line with the current Dáil arrangement – Leo Varadkar and the Government party and supporting cast to the Ceann Comhairle’s left and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin heading the Opposition ranks on Seán Ó Fearghaíl’s right.As this was a joint sitting, added authenticity was conveyed by the empty seats, but fewer than normal. The ceremonial stuff began back up at Leinster House where the gathering of the politicians for the traditional taking of the selfies kicked off on the plinth for the purposes of tweeting that they were all leaving Leinster House to take more selfies in the Mansion House which they would tweet in due course.Sinn Féin arrived in force, with their Northern Assembly and Westminster respresentatives in tow. This was lovely, as their MLAs haven’t seen parliamentary action in two years since their chamber was suspended. It offered them a day out and a refresher course in parliamentary participation. And it was a nice novelty too for the MPs, who have never darkened the door of the Commons. Unlike the members of the other parties, Mary Lou and her colleagues arrived en masse, and right at the same time as the British ambassador.Meanwhile, inside, her predecessor Gerry Adams enjoyed a brief chinwag with Drew Harris, the Garda Commissioner who used to be deputy chief constable of the PSNI.Micheál Martin’s front bench was conspicuous by their dark navy suits.“Fair play to them, they’re keeping up with tradition. They didn’t have a woman in the front row 100 years ago either,” sniggered a passing Fine Gael Senator.As the crowd filed in and the diplomats and EU representatives took their places in the rows behind the parliamentarians, along with former and retired members of Oireachtas staff, one observer looked down on the scene with a particularly keen eye.On the balcony, with his easel and oils, was Mick O’Dea, the renowned portrait painter and former president of the Royal Hibernian Academy. He has been commissioned by the Office of Public Works to do a painting of the Dáil 100 sitting.“I’m going to make a colour study for starters,” he explained. “I want to capture the gathering and the atmosphere as it exists now.”Beside the two tables and chairs on the platform – one for the Ceann Comhairle and the other for the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Denis O’Donovan, there was a green button-back leather seat awaiting the arrival of President Higgins, and a magnificent golden harp.When harpist Aisling Ennis plucked the first chords, it was a signal that the ceremony was about to go live on television. This put an end to the orgy of selfies among the politicians. Michael D bustled up the blue carpet to great applause and, above on the balcony, a brass quintet and percussionist from the Army band struck up the presidential salute.The Ceann Comhairle made the opening speech which was followed by a video montage of significant moments from the last 100 years of the Dáil. A woman from the film unit darted from the wings and began dabbing a powder puff on the Ceann Comhairle’s face. At least they didn’t have to contend with that back in 1919.Then Michael D delivered a thoughtful and thought-provoking address. It was around about the same time that UK prime minister Theresa May was in front of a baying House of Common. The contrast between this respectful celebration of 100 years of unbroken parliamentary democracy here and the shambles in London was not lost on the Dublin audience.The moving 1919 Declaration of Independence was read aloud by actors Áine Ní Laoghaire and Donncha Crowley and the First Dáil’s galvanising Message to the Free Nations of the World was read by former TDs in a video montage.Finally, the 2019 sitting commenced. It was an hour into proceedings and you could see the politicians were getting a little fidgety. There followed 10 speeches from the Taoiseach, leader of the Opposition, party leaders and group leaders.In a departure from Dáil practice, the speakers didn’t ramble over their allotted time. At the end of it all, the speakers of both Houses signed a Centenary Declaration and presented it to Anna Powell and Alex Gorman from Comhairle na nÓg, representing national child and youth councils.Following a final speech from the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Ceann Comhairle declared the joint sitting adjourned and the band played the National Anthem.Just a few minutes past the 5.30 finishing time, O’Dea’s canvas was safely bolted into a wooden frame on the easel. The politicians and the rest of the invited audience retired to a drinks reception next door in Fire restaurant before heading to a State reception back in the Round Room. Dawson Street remained closed to traffic until 11pm. Because they’re worth it.Normal service resumes in Leinster House today."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765754.1548094566!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"shift in ethiopia s afar culture emblematic of modernising mood","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAfar girls displaying the braided hair styles popular among the women. Photograph: James JeffreyMy three-wheel Bajaj taxi, powered by what sounded like a lawn mower engine, had somehow managed to bounce along the undulating dirt track through the scrub and weave around the plodding camels without toppling into the river flowing beside us.But it had had to halt at a checkpoint where two young Afar warriors peered in, each with an AK-47 nonchalantly hanging from a shoulder and an enormous knife-bearing scabbard at the waist. They told my guide, squashed beside me, that the Awash river had flooded the road further on.As we set off bouncing back the way we came, I looked back, wondering whether the Afar guard’s intense-looking stares following us represented curiosity, aggression or bafflement at my presence.Ethiopia’s remote northeast Afar region remains characterised by an infamous history and reputation. Most mentions of the Afar in literature or media, of the few there are, focus on the region’s Danakil Depression – the hottest place on earth where temperatures in the naked plains frequently soar above 50 degrees, exacerbated by the fierce blowing of the Gara, which translates as Fire Wind.Or they focus on the Afar people’s ferocity and intolerance of outsiders, once accompanied by a habit of cutting off the testicles of any foreigner found in their territory. The famous explorer Wilfred Thesiger avoided such a fate when he encountered the Afar in the 1930s during his exploration of the source of the Awash River, though he describes some tense encounters.I had a much easier time than Thesiger or many other foreigners preceding me, encountering another side to the Afar region and its people, far removed from the stereotypes usually presented.Undoubtedly a proud people – the Afar regard themselves as the oldest of Ethiopia’s ethnic groups having occupied their arid homeland for at least 2,000 years – the majority of Afar I engaged proved friendly, while patient about my photographic requests.Despite the winning smiles, you sense a robust mentality among this people, shaped by a tough nomadic pastoralist past that continues, with lone men guiding camels across plains rippling in the heat haze.At the same time, many Afar are increasingly drawn to the urban hubs of the region. The small town of Asaita is an absolute delight, a lush peaceful enclave beside the Awash river cutting a green swathe through the desert, evoking Egyptian pastures watered by the Nile.Clambering up a wooden ladder to the roof of the Basha Amare Hotel I secured a commanding view over the river, as various birdlife rode the thermals at eye level or came to rest on the hotel roof before launching again.Despite the Muslim character of Asaita and the Afar region, Berhanu, the hotel’s owner, came from Ethiopia’s Tigray region and so was Orthodox Christian – hence cool Harar beers were on hand for a string of sundowners as the sky filled with various hues.In the far distance, where the greenery sustained by the Awash begins to fade and yellow, a giant sugar factory glinted in the gathering gloom as its lights came on. It seems there is no longer any part of Ethiopia immune to the country’s strides to boost its economy.This is also well illustrated in the more boisterous city of Logiya, an hour’s minibus-ride from Asaita, where the old and new in Afar coexist more explicitly.At sunset amid roadside market stalls taking advantage of cooler temperatures luring locals outside, I squatted on a low stool at a small open-air tea stand as a Muezzin called from a nearby mosque and trucks trundled down the city’s main drag on the way to and from ports in Djibouti across the border.The trucks continued throughout the night and were still motoring come sunrise, as cafes opened for breakfasts of fuul, a spicy fava bean stew, and shoeshine boys got busy.The Afar is far from the strange and terrible place it was once portrayed as, while illustrative of the resilience of ancient traditions in a modernising Ethiopia."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765382.1548098512!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit barnier says withdrawal agreement is best deal possible","story":"Speaking in Brussels, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has reiterated that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.

Photograph: Reuters The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the Brexit withdrawal deal, which was comprehensively rejected by the House of Commons last week, remains the best agreement possible for Britain. Mr Barnier also appeared to rule out the prospect of the UK striking a bilateral agreement with Ireland to break the deadlock over the deal. Mr Barnier has been consistent in his message since the withdrawal agreement suffered a crushing defeat last week in the House of Commons that the EU would consider a potential British request for closer post-Brexit ties but will not renegotiate the deal.The backstop means that in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union. It is designed to avoid the return of a hard border in Ireland but has become the biggest obstacle to securing a withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU. “As I see, following carefully the political debate in London, this debate is much more now on the future relationship. As I said last week at the EU parliament, if the UK want to be more ambitious, we are ready to be,” Mr Barnier said. “It is now for the UK leaders to build a stable and positive majority for a deal. We are waiting for the next steps from the UK government but we are ready to work again on the political declaration.” Mr Coveney ruled out the renegotiation of the backstop and the withdrawal agreement and the imposition of a time-limit on the backstop. In what has been seen as a departure from the unity of the EU27 on the backstop, Poland’s foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz suggested the deadlock could be broken by setting a five-year time limit on the measure.He told Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita: “If Ireland asked the EU to amend the agreement with the British on the backstop so that it would apply temporarily - let’s say five years - the matter would be solved.“It would obviously be less favourable for Ireland than an indefinite backstop, but much more advantageous than no-deal Brexit.”Mr Czaputowicz said that London and Dublin were “playing chicken” over the border and risked a “head-on collision” in which Ireland stood to “lose the most”. He said he had discussed the issue with Mr Coveney and his British counterpart Jeremy Hunt. “I think it would be one of the solutions so that’s (an) idea to be discussed, I think within the European Union. I have the impression it might unblock the negotiations,” Mr Czaputowicz told the BBC. Germany’s foreign minister Heiko Maas played down the Polish minister’s initiative, telling reporters: “I am completely with my Irish colleague. He has already said what he thinks of it, which is nothing.” Mr Coveney insisted on the “willingness of the EU to be flexible in the context of the future relationship deal. If the UK wants to change its red lines or approach I think they would get a generous approach.”He said Mr Barnier had confirmed that the “EU continues to approach Brexit as one and that the EU position is the Irish position and vice versa”. Mr Coveney said the EU remains firmly supportive of the withdrawal agreement, including the “guarantees and fallback mechanisms to ensure that there will be no physical infrastructure between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland”. Downing Street on Monday morning ruled out seeking changes to the Belfast Agreement in an attempt to overcome the impasse over the backstop. Mrs May’s official spokesman also dismissed a report – in The Daily  - that she was considering a proposal to replace the backstop with a commitment to avoid a hard border written into the agreement.“The PM has made clear on multiple occasions that we are committed to upholding the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and still agreeing a solution that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” he said.The spokesman also dismissed a report that the prime minister wanted to replace the backstop with a bilateral agreement between Dublin and London. “It’s not something that we’re looking at,” he said.He confirmed, however, that Mrs May viewed the backstop as the biggest obstacle in the way of winning parliamentary support for her Brexit withdrawal deal.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Mr Coveney on Sunday rejected suggestions of a bilateral treaty with Ireland to avoid a backstop, describing it as a “non-starter”.

Photograph: Antonio Pedro SantosEPAMichel Barnier corrected his interviewer. No, he told RTÉ at the briefest of “doorsteps” in the Berlaymont EU headquarters – on the contrary, the backstop is not London’s main preoccupation.The main focus of MPs in the House of Commons debates he watched, Barnier said, was the shape of the future relationship with the union, and it is in discussions about the future relationship that there are real prospects for a deal, one that would satisfy the Commons and Brussels.If only the first part of that observation were true.There was a strong element of wishful thinking in the EU chief Brexit negotiator’s comments. Brussels had hoped that, in reaching out to build a Commons majority, UK prime minister Theresa May would now appeal to the soft Brexiteers and Remainers, and abandon hope that the irredentist wing of her own party would be reconciled to her deal.Barnier was again repeating his mantra that if the British government was willing to abandon some of its own red lines – notably on customs union membership and membership of the single market – the EU would not be found wanting.Tánaiste Simon Coveney was also on message. In his conversation here on Monday morning with Barnier, he said, the latter made clear “the willingness of the EU to be flexible in the context of the future relationship declaration. If the UK wants to change its red lines or approach, I think they would get a generous approach.”In that direction, Brussels is convinced, lies the only opportunity to build a Commons majority for anything.On the other hand, repeated ad nauseam, Brussels does not see any prospect of reopening the withdrawal agreement text, and specifically its backstop provisions. Despite UK minister for trade Liam Fox’s contention over the weekend that a new way could be found of doing the backstop, Barnier insisted the backstop was “the best deal possible”.And while some British observers in Brussels cling to the idea that eventually our fellow member states will become disenchanted with Irish “obduracy”, there is no evidence here that any of them wants to call into question the backstop.The only chink that appeared in the EU defences was a suggestion by the Polish foreign minister that a five-year time limit could be set to the backstop to meet Conservative and unionist concerns that it would become a permanent fixture.No way, Coveney told journalists – a time limit was incompatible with an insurance policy. And Barnier wasn’t having any of it either. The 27 are absolutely united, he told Coveney.The Tánaiste also said he was very pleased to receive a reassurance from the British government, that, contrary to press reports, it had no desire to renegotiate the Belfast Agreement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3765844.1548100549!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france and germany to sign new treaty on co operation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel: Critics say the treaty lacks ambition and does not address the euro zone, migrants or social and environmental policy. Photograph: Wolfgang RattayFrench president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel will meet on Tuesday morning in the coronation room of the town hall in the German city of Aachen to sign a new “Treaty of Franco-German Co-operation and Integration”, 56 years after Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer signed the Treaty of the Élysée, which is the cornerstone of reconciliation between the two countries.The new treaty will “complement, not replace” the previous treaty, an adviser to Macron stressed, calling it the “treaty of convergence”.The 28-article, 13-page text is a bland commitment to relaunch a raft of Franco-German projects. Brexit and the spread of populist nationalism across the continent have created “an objectively difficult context” in the EU, the presidential adviser said. In the run-up to European parliamentary elections, “It is all the more important to have a Franco-German couple that is on the offensive, efficient, engaged and co-ordinated,” he added.Paris and Berlin already co-ordinate their positions before every EU summit. \u0026nbspAs noted in the treaty, “The two countries consult one another regularly at every level before important European events.”France and Germany recently launched programmes to build tanks and aircraft together. The treaty notes vaguely that they will “elaborate a shared approach to arms exports”.A mutual defence clause requires the two countries “to assist each other by all means at their disposal, including armed force, in the event of armed aggression against one of their territories”.That commitment already exists under article 42, paragraph seven, of the Treaty on European Union, and in article five of the North Atlantic Treaty. These texts “inspired each other”, the adviser said. “They mean there are concentric circles, of German and French proximity, within the EU and then Nato. ”The twinning of French and German schools and towns is to be relaunched. The treaty provides legal means to harmonise social charges, taxation and rules on either side of the border. More than 50,000 French people cross the border to work in Germany each day.The text aspires to a “Franco-German economic zone” and establishes a joint council of economic experts which will try to bring opposing economic visions closer together. “In France, we insist on a budget for the euro zone, on stimulus,” the adviser said, whereas the German Council of Economic Experts “often reproaches the German government for overspending”.French and German television networks have begun work on a “Franco-German digital information platform”. And the two countries will co-operate in dismantling the French nuclear power plant on the border at Fessenheim.Macron has been weakened by the gilets jaunes revolt, and Merkel will leave office in the autumn of 2021 at the latest. Under their rule, France and Germany have not been able to agree on a budget for the euro zone or the taxation of internet giants, both major goals for Macron. Critics say the new treaty lacks ambition because it does not address the euro zone, the integration of migrants or social and environmental policy.The French believe they may find it easier to work with Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has replaced Merkel at the head of the CDU. “AKK” is from the Rhineland border region and is fluent in French.Article five of the new treaty foresees “exchanges” between the French representative on the security council and the German ambassador, who holds a temporary seat for two years. Article eight expresses French support for Germany’s quest to obtain a permanent seat on the council. Germany has long sought such a seat. So have Brazil, India and Japan."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The real problem is that we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating. It slows the speed of eating and means you wolf down fewer calories.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said:  “There is some evidence to suggest that watching screens can distract children from feeling full. What’s more, we know that children are often exposed to adverts for unhealthy food and drink whilst watching their favourite TV shows, which in turn can lead to higher calorie intake.Our screen time guidance recommends that parents and their children build screen time around positive family activities – such as sharing meals together. But with one in three children leaving primary school overweight or obese, it is clear that action is needed at a national level to tackle the childhood obesity problem. That’s why we want to see Government publish their consultation on restricting junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions online, without delay, he said. The chief medical officer said she had embraced the label of “chief nanny” after years of being described as such.“It\u0027s good to be the chief nanny if it has an impact,” Dame Sally told the event, reiterating calls for extra taxes on sugary and salty snacks.“I am wearing my label with pride,” she said. However, she questioned whether a male chief medical officer would have attracted the same nickname, saying the issue “raised questions” about sexism.Advice or admonition | Dame Sally\u0026#039s previous warnings“We won\u0027t go there,” she continued. “Just make the changes and chief nanny will be happy.”And she urged politicians to listen to her calls to extend the sugar levy, extending taxes so they were placed on chocolates, sweets, and cakes as well as on milky drinks.“We need political will. If you look at outcomes think how many lives were saved by seat belts,” she said.“Think how many lives were saved by the smoking ban in public places. Think how many lives  could be saved by extending the sugar levy. Politicians do need to listen to me - and I keep telling them this,” she said.Open letter to Xi demands China to release detained Canadians Jeremy Corbyn backs MPs\u0026#39 plan to force a second Brexit referendum Fourteen dead after fire engulfs two gas tankers off CrimeaChris Packham: I\u0026#39ll take royals to task over grouse shooting at Buckingham Palace when I accept CBE Online trolls should be registered on government database, say MPsImagine: James Graham, review: a psychological profile of the extraordinarily nice man behind Brexit: the Uncivil WarTheresa May promises Nicola Sturgeon greater say over Brexit ahead of meetingSecond Scout volunteer suspended and more groups referred to police amid extremism concernsComputers fail in courts across England as judges and CPS struggle to access vital case informationExtremism and hate preachers on the rise at campuses, universities warnedTheresa May\u0026#39s chief Brexit negotiator cast doubt over her \u0026#39Plan B\u0026#39 in text to Philip HammondSchools are right to stop students from wearing trainers as it encourages \u0026#39footwear competitiveness\u0026#39, says Education Secretary Police chief resigns after two female officers make accusations of inappropriate behaviour against himComment: A second referendum would be a disaster for Britain, but it\u0026#39s where we are now headingWhere next: With Theresa May losing control of Brexit which rival plans have a chance of success?Fiona Bruce \u0026#39bullied by hard-Left\u0026#39 as Labour supporters demand BBC release Diane Abbott footageEverest climbers to be cut by a third as China plans clean-up of world\u0026#39s highest peakClashes in Caracas as Venezuelan forces arrest rebelling soldiersEgyptian TV presenter sentenced to year in jail for interviewing gay prostituteWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 21 january 2019","story":"Greek riot police block the stairs leading to parliament during clashes after a rally in Athens, Greece.

I see nothing but exciting and groundbreaking opportunities ahead.In a medium that is changing so quickly on a daily basis, the potential for growth is unprecedented.Our plan is, to give it all we\u0027ve got, see where we can get to and have the most possible fun along the way. It makes me smile every time I think about it.Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson described the appointment as a major coup.Commenting on the launch of Scala radio, Simon Mayo said: “There are hundreds of radio stations playing rock and pop, and only two classical music stations - until now.

Could exchange controls be imposed one night with little warning? Fanciful? Not really.How on earth could this happen? Here is how.The first step requires a messy Brexit, an election and a Labour Party victory. Not completely out of the question I trust you will agree.Next, a hard-left dominated Labour Government begins implementing key elements of its manifesto. Nationalisation of the railways first mail services and public utilities to be determined.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialPersonal income taxes are raised various forms of wealth taxes follow.Foreign owners of UK property are targeted for additional levies. Corporate taxes are increased sharply in one form or another. Shareholders in nationalized enterprises receive newly issued Gilts (UK government bonds)\u0026nbspin exchange for their shares. Government determines the value of their shares.The consequences? UK-bound international investment ceases. UK-based businesses and iniduals move money abroad. The UK stock market tanks. Sterling plummets. UK borrowing costs rise. Inflation is forecast. Gilt prices plunge – and with it the value that shareholders in now nationalized enterprises received in forced exchange for their shares.This is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look likeThe Prime Minister calls an emergency session of the cabinet following which he appears in front of Number 10 to announce the following: “Our country,” he explains, “is faced with a crisis. Unscrupulous businesses are transferring abroad the wealth of our Nation – monies that were earned on the backs of the average citizen. The rich who profiteered from a rigged financial system are absconding with their ill-gotten gains.Once again, the favoured few are plundering the wealth of the people who produced it.\u0026nbsp I therefore announce that effective midnight tonight all money transfers out of the United Kingdom will be subject to State control. For businesses, prior approval will be required. Violations will be severely punished. Meanwhile, inidual UK citizens will be permitted to acquire and carry foreign currency up to a prescribed maximum. These measures will remain in effect as long as is deemed necessary to meet the threat. We will give more details in the days ahead.”Reaction? Experts forecast doom, gloom and a return to the 1970s. Iniduals with short memories andor those fed up with a system seemingly skewed in favour of the elite, applaud the decisive action – with albeit concern for their European holiday travel.Meanwhile, interbank trading with UK based institutions grinds to a halt pending answers to the following questions: will the UK domiciled counterparty be able to deliver the countervalue of a trade? Will UK based banks be permitted to repay foreign interbank borrowings? Will fund redemptions by foreign nationals be honoured and transferable abroad? The Bank of England schedules an emergency meeting to discuss.So, there you have it. A few additional observations. We have been there before. Capital controls generally and exchange controls in particular were a long-time feature of both the UK and inidual European countries in the post war period. Just because the generations who oversee today’s capital flows have no personal experience with such regulation does not mean they might not one day have the pleasure.A second point is that this scenario requires that Britain first leave the EU. Why? Because many of the actions described above would run counter to EU regulation. Hence the ambivalence of many on the far left of the Labour Party to the UK’s membership in the European Union. EU membership imposes constraints on anti-capitalists as well as regulatory burdens on business. Thus it was in the run-up to the Britain’s 1973 accession to the EU that members of Labour’s left wing opposed British membership. \u0026nbspPlus ca change…Robert Jenkins is a member of the Board of Governors of CFA Institute.

Close to two-thirds of\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions\u0026nbspare released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs, the report says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe now use 92.8 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass every year -\u0026nbspthree times as much as in 1970 -\u0026nbspwith a further doubling predicted by 2050. Yet most governments’ climate change strategies look primarily at measures such as renewable energy and barely consider creating a circular economy.The report calls on governments to take action to move from a linear “take-make-waste” economy to a circular one that maximises the use of existing assets, while reducing dependence on new raw materials and minimising waste. The Netherlands has set an example by introducing\u0026nbspa target of becoming 50 per cent\u0026nbspcircular by 2030 and 100 per cent\u0026nbspby 2050.\u0026nbspIn a report released as world leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum, Circle Economy argues that innovation to extend the life of existing resources will not only curb emissions but also reduce social inequality and foster low-carbon growth. One example of how this could work in practice is construction in China where the majority of houses and roads people will use in the next 50 years have yet to be built. Trump’s EPA nominee says climate change ‘not the greatest crisis’Supreme Court refuses Exxon’s effort to keep years of documents secretClimate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementThe researchers calculate that China’s built environment emits 3.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year and is set to more than double in size by 2050, from 239 to 562 billion tonnes of material. Less than 2 per cent of China’s construction inputs are reused or recycled material, wlthough this is improving. Increasing this proportion further can make a significant impact on emissions and help the world keep with the 1.5C increase in temperature agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement.“A 1.5 degree world can only be a circular world,” Circle Economy’s chief executive, Harald Friedl, said.Applied systematically, circular business models would “tip the balance in the battle against global warming”, he said.“This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It estimates that in 2016 between 1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of food products shrank in size, while between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent increased.\u0026nbspMike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises.”Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the effect of price rises was “stealthy” in an era of low inflation.“It’s a crafty way to effectively raise prices, because even the most eagle-eyed shoppers tend to only really notice the price, so few will spot they’re getting less value for money.“In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued.“The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn’t spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Close to two-thirds of\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions\u0026nbspare released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods to serve society’s needs, the report says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe now use 92.8 billion tonnes of minerals, fossil fuels, metals and biomass every year -\u0026nbspthree times as much as in 1970 -\u0026nbspwith a further doubling predicted by 2050. Yet most governments’ climate change strategies look primarily at measures such as renewable energy and barely consider creating a circular economy.The report calls on governments to take action to move from a linear “take-make-waste” economy to a circular one that maximises the use of existing assets, while reducing dependence on new raw materials and minimising waste. The Netherlands has set an example by introducing\u0026nbspa target of becoming 50 per cent\u0026nbspcircular by 2030 and 100 per cent\u0026nbspby 2050.\u0026nbspIn a report released as world leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum, Circle Economy argues that innovation to extend the life of existing resources will not only curb emissions but also reduce social inequality and foster low-carbon growth. One example of how this could work in practice is construction in China where the majority of houses and roads people will use in the next 50 years have yet to be built. Trump’s EPA nominee says climate change ‘not the greatest crisis’Supreme Court refuses Exxon’s effort to keep years of documents secretClimate talks extended as US and other polluters hold up agreementThe researchers calculate that China’s built environment emits 3.7 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases every year and is set to more than double in size by 2050, from 239 to 562 billion tonnes of material. Less than 2 per cent of China’s construction inputs are reused or recycled material, wlthough this is improving. Increasing this proportion further can make a significant impact on emissions and help the world keep with the 1.5C increase in temperature agreed under the Paris Climate Agreement.“A 1.5 degree world can only be a circular world,” Circle Economy’s chief executive, Harald Friedl, said.Applied systematically, circular business models would “tip the balance in the battle against global warming”, he said.“This will not only reduce emissions but also boost growth by making economies more efficient.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”.

Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHPhilippakis told\u0026nbspNME\u0026nbspin July 2017 that the political landscape was likely to inspire the lyrics of the group’s next tunes.“I think the world is obviously affecting the way we feel as iniduals,” he said.“I definitely feel that when I’m writing lyrics or music, that it’s in dialogue with what’s going on around me in isolation – so I’m sure there will be things in the lyrics to do with, not just the political climate but also the environmental situation that’s happening now.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Nominations will be announced on Tuesday, 22 January the ceremony itself is set for roughly a month later, on Sunday, 24 February at Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre. Here are our predictions for how the nominations will pan out in the main six categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor.The Oscars have the unique ability to nominate up to 10 films for Best Picture, over the traditional five entries – a format change first put in place a decade ago. The awards race has already narrowed itself down to two fierce competitors – Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma and Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born – but there will be plenty of room for other favourites here. Green Book, Vice, If Beale Street Could Talk, and The Favourite are all sure to pick up nominations.However, 2018 offered a stellar slate of films directed by women, all boasting the right amount of prestige for awards season, among them Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, Chloé Zhao’s The Rider, and Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace. At this point, it would be\u0026nbspan embarrassing move, quite frankly,\u0026nbspfor the Academy to reveal a slate of 10 films all directed by men.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMost likely to make the cut is Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, a beautifully orchestrated character piece that will almost certainly land Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination. Unfortunately, it’s likely to lose out to First Man. Damien Chazelle’s La La Land follow-up is an early frontrunner that’s since fallen by the wayside, but it still has clout to guarantee a few nominations. Although the Academy hasn’t filled the full 10 nominations since 2010, usually opting for a selection of nine, the list below is of the top 10 contenders in the category.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Since Cuarón is heavily favoured to win in this category, any other nominee for Best Director will essentially earn the honour of losing to him. Cooper will almost certainly make an appearance, alongside Spike Lee for BlacKkKlansman and Adam McKay for Vice. While The Favourite has fared well this awards season, its director Yorgos Lanthimos didn’t receive nominations at either the Golden Globes or the Directors Guild Awards, and there\u0027s certainly a feeling\u0026nbspthat voters view the film as belonging more to its stars than its director.Although the expanded list of nominations for Best Picture almost guarantees Black Panther a spot, the real test of its awards appeal will be here. The odds aren’t particularly in Ryan Coogler’s favour, since he lost out both at the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild Awards, but we could be in for a surprise. Last year’s debacle, when\u0026nbspthe Academy introduced a Popular Film category and then swiftly recalled it, may have left a lasting impression in voters’s minds, meaning 2019 could see a definitive statement made that the Academy is eager to embrace the quality blockbuster.This category may turn out to be the most hotly contested of the night. Glenn Close, Lady Gaga, and Olivia Colman have all been picking up trophies for the respective performances in The Wife, A Star is Born, and The Favourite. The Critics Choice Awards even struggled to even narrow it down to one person, sharing the awards between both Gaga and Close. Melissa McCarthy is also very likely to see a nomination here for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, while the last slot will be a contest between Emily Blunt for Mary Poppins Returns and Nicole Kidman for Destroyer.The frustrating truth of awards season is, of course, that anyone who isn’t already an established name or a massively publicised Hollywood breakout rarely gets a look-in. The result is that one of the year’s most phenomenal performances, Yalitza Aparicio in Roma, will probably end up going without recognition, even when Roma may sweep the awards elsewhere. \u0026nbspThe odds are less clear-cut when it comes to Best Actor, and there’s a chance the winner here may be partially determined by the mood of the rest of the awards race. Vice’s Christian Bale, Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek, and A Star is Born’s Bradley Cooper form a trio of strong contenders.However, their chances could depend on how favourably the Academy looks on their respective films. If A\u0026nbspStar is Born really ends up being Roma’s biggest competition, Cooper’s chances could go up. If Bohemian Rhapsody is snubbed in other categories, Malek’s chances could go down.\u0026nbspGreen Book’s Viggo Mortensen is also an easy bet here.The last spot, however, could be a little more unpredictable. BlacKkKlansman’s John David Washington is the safer choice, but there’s a question of whether First Reformed’s Ethan Hawke will make a surprise appearance here. The film, at large, hasn’t fared particularly well this awards season, despite the massive critical acclaim it received on release there’s a good chance its indie credentials (it was distributed by A24) have meant the film has been overlooked by voters.Anyone who’s seen The Favourite will be surprised to see Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone both pitched here as supporting roles, since the film is quite obviously a three-hander. Call it another case of “category fraud”: studios have increasingly treated the split between lead and supporting as a strategic game, and there’s a clear hope here that The Favourite will end up with wins in two acting categories as opposed to one. However, Stone and Weisz will face stiff competition from If Beale Street Could Talk’s Regina King, with Vice’s Amy Adams and First Man’s Claire Foy also expected to receive nominations.Thomasin McKenzie should be somewhere on this list, since her performance in Leave No Trace has been praised across the board. Yet, like\u0026nbspAparicio, McKenzie suffers a combination of not being a recognisable name, not having had a major publicity push, and appearing in a fairly low-budget independent production.Mahershala Ali’s Golden Globe win for Green Book has secured him as the favourite in this category, but there’s some competition still from both BlacKkKlansman’s Adam Driver and Can You Ever Forgive Me?’s Richard E Grant. Sam Rockwell is expected to appear for Vice, although his work has been overshadowed by Bale’s formidable Dick Cheney impression. Timothée Chalamet, meanwhile, will likely continue his Hollywood ascendency and land a nomination for Beautiful Boy.However, one of the strangest exclusions from this year’s awards race is Sam Elliott for A Star is Born. The actor was an early favourite to win, but has dropped off the radar in recent months without much rhyme or reason, perhaps overshadowed in the film’s publicity campaign by the central pairing of Gaga and Cooper.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company also raised almost £15m in a share issue.Mr Johnson’s stake had been worth around £160m prior to the revelations.“Among other manipulations, this involved thousands of false entries into the company’s ledgers.“It will take some time before a reliable trading outlook can be completed while the above work streams progress.“The initial indications from the work carried out to date is that the cashflow and profitability of the business has been overstated in the past and is materially below that announced in the trading update on 12 October 2018, which was based on limited work carried out over a 48-hour period.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers think they have found the cause of the mysterious orbits in the furthest reaches of our neighbourhoodClick to followThe Independent TechScientists think they have found the cause of mysterious movements at the edge of our solar system – and it is not Planet Nine.At the very edge of our neighbourhood, some objects appear to be orbiting in an unusual way that suggests something entirely unexpected is happening, without our knowledge.Various scientists have suggested that could be the consequence of a huge hidden planet, ten times the size of Earth, hiding in the darkness in the distant reaches of the solar system. No such object has ever been discovered, but it has been hypothesised because of the unusual way objects we can see are moving around.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut now a new paper suggests an entirely different explanation: there is a disc made up of small icy bodies that put together is as much as ten times as massive as the Earth.That explanation appears to account for the unusual orbits that can be seen in some objects in the distant solar system, the researchers claim.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the search is complicated by the fact that it is harder to see the properties of our own solar system, compared with those that we are looking at from the outside.When observing other systems, we often study the disc surrounding the host star to infer the properties of any planets in orbit around it, said Sefilian.The problem is when you\u0027re observing the disc from inside the system, it\u0027s almost impossible to see the whole thing at once. While we don\u0027t have direct observational evidence for the disc, neither do we have it for Planet Nine, which is why we\u0027re investigating other possibilities. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that observations of Kuiper belt analogues around other stars, as well as planet formation models, reveal massive remnant populations of debris.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The confectionary company has since backtracked and announced Toblerones would revert to their original shape.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialMars shrank its Maltesers, M\u0026ampMs and Minstrels by up to 15 per cent while McVities Jaffa Cakes are around 10 per cent lighter, but prices have remained unchanged.The research looked at 17,000 items between\u0026nbspSeptember 2015 and June 2017, a period that included the Brexit referendum, but the ONS said\u0026nbspit found\u0026nbspno change in the frequency of size changes after the vote.Pizzas must shrink or lose their toppings under anti-obesity planManufacturers faced rising input costs as the pound fell sharply in the days following the referendum.The bread and cereal category saw\u0026nbspthe most size changes with 36 reductions and 18 increases, the ONS said.Chocolate bars also fell victim shrinkflation, with the confectionary seeing 25 products shrinking and five that grew.But the ONS analysis suggests that shrinkflation is a relatively rare phenomenon. It estimates that in 2016 between 1 per cent and 2.1 per cent of food products shrank in size, while between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent increased.\u0026nbspMike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises.”Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the effect of price rises was “stealthy” in an era of low inflation.“It’s a crafty way to effectively raise prices, because even the most eagle-eyed shoppers tend to only really notice the price, so few will spot they’re getting less value for money.“In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued.“The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn’t spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I know that all prime ministers are promising to help you, but believe me the truth is that no-one has an appetite for revolution in Europe only because of your stupid referendum.\u0026nbsp“If you try to force us, to hurry us, you will lose everything.\u0026nbsp And for the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing.”Germany says UK should \u0027think again\u0027 on Brexit with second referendumAt the time Mr Cameron had publicly said he would try to renegotiate EU membership to get a better deal for Britain, and then hold an in-out referendum on whether to leave to stay. The much-vaunted renegotiation failed to secure any significant changes in key areas such as free movement of people. Mr Cameron went on to lose the referendum, triggering Brexit.Tusk added: “I asked David Cameron, ‘Why did you decide on this referendum, this – it’s so dangerous, so even stupid, you know,’ and, he told me ¬– and I was really amazed and even shocked – that the only reason was his own party.“But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory.”David Cameron insists he does not regret calling Brexit referendumCameron\u0027s rumoured return to frontline politics mocked by Labour MPs Tories adopting \u0027far-right ideology\u0027 says former leader of its MEPsDavid Cameron buys shepherd\u0027s hut for Cornwall holiday homeGermany says UK should \u0027think again\u0027 on Brexit with second referendumHe also recounted a telephone call with Mr Cameron ahead of the prime minister’s resignation, describing it as a “day of reckoning”.The first episode of the three-party documentary, Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, will air on BBC Two next Monday evening.Appearing in the same documentary, former French president Francois Hollande, who was in charge at the time, explained why the EU gave few concessions to the UK.“Any concessions made to the UK on freedom of movement in the EU would be easily requested by any other member state,” he said.“I said to him, honestly, if he got a special deal for the UK because there was a fear he might lose the referendum, then other countries under populist pressure would try to organise their own referendum and get their own special deal.”Another former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, recounted discussions with Mr Cameron about special protections for the City of London as far back as 2011 – which would ominously set the tone for future discussions about EU reform.Created with Sketch.

The UK simply cannot afford to lose valuable staff from its already strained health and social care sectors.”EU leaders also welcomed the move. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament’s\u0026nbspBrexit coordinator, said: “I am delighted the planned settled status fees have been waived. This is a victory for common sense.

a move she said would go against the referendum result.She said: “There is widespread concern about the possibility of the UK leaving without a deal. And there are those on both sides of the House who want the government to rule this out.“But we need to be honest with the British people about what that means. The right way to rule out no deal is for this House to approve a deal with the European Union. That is what this government is seeking to achieve.”She continued: “The only other guaranteed way to avoid a no-deal Brexit is to revoke Article 50, which would mean staying in the EU.“There are others who think that what we need is more time, so they say we should extend Article 50 to give longer for parliament to debate how we should leave and what a deal should look like. This is not ruling out no deal, but simply deferring the point of decision. And the EU are very unlikely simply to agree to extend Article 50 without a plan for how we are going approve a deal.“So when people say ‘rule out no deal’ the consequences of what they are actually saying are that if we in parliament can’t approve a deal we should revoke Article 50. I believe this would go against the referendum result and I do not believe that is a course of action that we should take, or which this House should support.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Ashley Cowburn looks at one of the amendments\u0026nbsptabled by a Labour MP that aims to avoid a disorderly exit from the EUClick to followIndy PoliticsWill Yvette Cooper’s amendment take no deal off the table?Nothing has changed. Following the greatest defeat in modern parliamentary history over her\u0026nbspBrexit deal, Theresa May has used a statement in the Commons to outline her plan B, which appears remarkably similar to plan A.The prime minister will now seek further assurances\u0026nbspfrom the EU over the highly contentious issue of the Irish backstop –\u0026nbspsomething, of course, she attempted to do after delaying the first “meaningful vote” in December.But this is where the parliamentary battles begin –\u0026nbspas MPs can now attach amendments to the “neutral”, plan B\u0026nbspmotion, which will be tabled today by the government with a view to being debated and voted on come 29 January.One of those amendments will be tabled under the name of the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who\u0026nbspchairs parliament’s Home Affairs Committee.Government to scrap £65 fee for EU citizens who want to stay in UKTusk says he told Cameron to ‘get real’ over ‘stupid’ Brexit voteNo10 admits May needs to try ‘something different’ on Brexit- liveThe Brexit leadership vacuum on both sides has never been clearerIMF slashes global growth forecast and warns on trade warShe is seeking time for a vote on her bill to give MPs the power to suspend the Article 50 withdrawal process if there is no deal in place with Brussels by 26 February –\u0026nbspthus preventing a no-deal scenario on 29 March.If the time is allocated, and the legislation passes,\u0026nbspit would mean Theresa May has just over a month to get parliamentary approval for her Brexit deal. Failing this, MPs would be given a vote on extending Article 50 for a nine-month period.If MPs did vote for the measure, however, the EU27 would have to agree, unanimously, to grant the request to extend the negotiating period.Those backing the move by Ms Cooper are senior MPs from across the Commons, including Nicky Morgan, Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn\u0026nbspand Norman Lamb.The Labour frontbench is yet to say whether it is supporting the amendment, but one of the party’s shadow Brexit ministers dropped a pretty clear hint Jeremy Corbyn would do so.“Absolutely something we are seriously considering,” said Labour’s Jenny Chapman.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAnnouncing her proposals, Ms Cooper said the government “cannot just push the country into no deal because they have run out of time”, adding: “The prime minister should rule out no deal.“But if she won’t, and if nothing else is sorted by the end of February, then parliament should be given a vote on whether to extend Article 50 instead or it will be too late.”Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

That list already includes several notable democrats like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard.Ms Harris could also come under some fire for her tenure as state attorney general in California, a record that has generally been considered to be “progressive” but has come under fire recently as speculation has swirled about her potential candidacy.That includes criticism of Ms Harris’ seeming reluctance to embrace criminal justice reform in the state, and her record on wrongful convictions.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That many want to leave without a deal ­boggles their minds and induces fainting and nausea.So it was on Thursday as they all watched TV’s Question Time, that ­traditional safe space for left-wing, Government-bashing Remainerism.The audience in Derby hollered approval at the idea we should simply walk away on March . Thatno deal can be found, then that is at least the Brexit a majority voted for in .One Europhile writer found it “staggering, terrying”. Which, funnily enough, is how voters view a political and media elite so wedded to a comfortable status quo that they are completely disconnected from anyone outside the bubble.The Sun would prefer a deal. We just cannot support the fatal flaws in Theresa May’s. But millions, not just Leavers now, ARE ready to brave No Deal because they know that democracy must deliver what the majority voted for.Andthe Remainer elite are shocked by a few dozen Leavers on TV they had better prepare themselves.If Brexit doesn’t happen,Article  is revoked andBritain is forced to vote again, the roar of rage will deafen them.COMMONS Speakers normally get a ­peerage. We are delighted to learn John Bercow won’t.One senior minister branded him “a biased f***wit” and “repulsive beyond measure”. Not a ringing endorsement.But then a man who tore up centuries of Parliamentary procedure in his ­personal battle against the biggest ­democratic mandate in our history deserves ignominy, not honour.And that’s before you factor in serious bullying allegations against him.It is a shame he won’t also lose his £million State pension pot. But we can’t have everything.Bercow’s only hope, following his bias against the Government, is that Opposition parties put him up for a Lords seat.But that would rather give the game away, wouldn’t it THE staggering achievements of Brampton Manor should inspire every state school.It’s an academy in Newham, London — one of the country’s poorest areas. Yet  sixth-formers this year alone have got Oxbridge offers. Nearly all are ethnic minority kids, most of them the first in their family ever to go to university.There’s no big secret. Just hard graft, long hours and bright, motivated pupils encouraged to believe anything is possible. Plus tireless and dedicated staff.It’s an incredible success story.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What a powerful statement.This school’s success is rooted in a couple of factors. It has a dedicated “study centre” open from am until pm.The centre was opened after the school realised that some of their students who live in busy or chaotic households don’t have access to a quiet study space.Role models are emphasised within the school, which has created a “university access team” featuring five full-time members of staff who are all Oxbridge graduates.Quite apart from the academic challenges — the privilege and elitism surrounding the world of Oxbridge is so intimidating that even the brightest kids coming from ordinary households could easily conclude that they wouldn’t belong.So the university access team also help them to see Oxbridge as an achievable goalThey take students to museums and find other ways to get them excited about study.Their sole aim is to support potential candidates, from  upwards, to get into good universities. I often say you can’t help where you start but you can decide where you end up.And this is a brilliant example.This kind of success comes down largely to self-belief.These children have been encouraged to visualise a very bright future for themselves, and to believe that they are worthy of it. And with that powering you, the sky really is the limit.Which is why the story about a young woman called Liv Conlon, from Bothwell near Glasgow, also caught my eye.Liv set up her first business at , importing goods from China and selling them online.She used the money she made from that to start another company, called The Property Stagers, which furnishes empty homes and, after years of bullying, decided to leave school at  to run it full time.Liv is now . The company furnishes more than  properties a year, and she’s hired a team of ten people – including her mother and brother.She’s also bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat — all without the help from the Bank of Mum and Dad.She believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her set on being a success.“It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that just put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better.”An outstanding attitude and what a role model Liv is.Nothing is more powerful than feeling irrepressible and the desire to cock a snook at the people who don’t want you to achieve.Both these stories prove the same point: If you believe in yourself – and you are prepared to work hard – there is no limit to what you can do.Yes, you need a bit of luck. But in my experience the harder you work, the luckier you get.DJ Sara Cox said this week she has to “work at friendship” as she gets older, words that really resonated for me.When you are young friendships are the backbone of your le and feel effortless.But things change.Andyou aren’t careful you get boring.I’m shocked at how easy it can be to reach a point where you don’t want to go out or do anything in your spare time.But you know what  It’s so important to force yourself off the sofa every so often and have a laugh with your girlfriends. I just need to get Dry January out of the way first.No wonder some envious people have been making mean comments.Meghan has glided through the past few months with real dignity, while also looking a milllion dollars.She is positively glowing. . .  something I never quite managed during pregnancy, despite all the promises.MY heart went out this week to Andy Murray, and the despair he so clearly feels that his body is letting him down and ending his career.It’s a reminder that the toughest part of the job for sports stars is the end. And the higher you’ve flown, the bigger the fall.I had a glimpse of how it feels ten years ago when I sold my business and had a bit of a . . . lull, before the next thing happened.During that time, I’d phone people up and when the receptionist asked me where I was calling from, my answer was, “Um, my living room.”For the first time in my le I wasn’t being defined by my business or my job title.The same will surely be true for Andy when he can no longer say that he is an international tennis player.The dficulty for professional sportspeople on retiring is that, suddenly, everything you have been geared up towards and focusing on is not there any more. There is nothing so harsh as the realisation that you are no longer relevant.I’ve seen this happen to a lot of footballers.One day you are a revered player for a Premier League club where everything is done for you. The next you are on your own, trying to make your way in a not-always-friendly world.In my view, people who cope are those who look forward not back. They look at what is happening in the next chapter, rather than who they once were.Take John McEnroe who is a hugely successful TV pundit and author. He has capitalised on his success – and shared it. And I have a feeling that, when the pain subsides, Andy Murray will do the same.HAS anyone  noticed how many news stories at the moment seem to be about people carrying and using a machete Why on earth would anyone need to carry a machete in England  We don’t live in a jungle, although it might feel like it at times.The only way to stop this epidemic is to pass a law prohibiting the ownership of this type of weapon.Anyone selling them on the internet for dispatch to this country needs to be issued with a UK arrest warrant and prosecuted.NOT quite sure what is motivating everyone to take part in the so-called “Ten-Year Challenge” – where you upload a photo of yourself from ten years ago to social media, together with a recent one, we’ve mocked one up for Adele.The only possible reason to do this, as far as I can see, is to say: “Haven’t I aged well ”I like a challenge . . . but this one’s not for me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The margin was higher than expected because some Labour MPs abstained, highlighting deep unease in the party about its leader’s fitness for high office.In contrast, even after a sobering setback, Theresa May signalled her determination to seek further concessions from Brussels.Mr Corbyn rebuffed the Prime Minister’s offer of talks unless she ruled out leaving with No Deal. If only he took such an uncompromising stance towards terrorists and despots. In reality, Jeremy Corbyn has no idea what Labour’s policy on Brexit would be.The path ahead is set in law. The UK will leave the EU in  days’ time — preferably with a deal,not on World Trade Organisation terms.  If Labour wants to reverse that legislation, it will require government backing — and the PM has made clear she won’t support it.The EU has asked to hear what alternatives the UK would accept. So this is a moment of truth, a test for the EU. Are they serious about a deal The Government must seek two essential changes. First, a mechanism so we can exit from the backstop — an interim regime of rules.Otherwise we risk being stuck in an indefinite limbo of laws, with no UK say over them.Second, we want a future relationship based on a free trade agreement so we are free to strike deals with other countries, from Latin America to Asia, to create jobs and cut prices in UK shops.If the EU won’t budge, we should keep our pledge to leave on WTO terms. That way, we can mitigate the risks of some short-term disruption.Dissident MPs are firing blanks. The Norway option means more concessions, including giving up UK control over immigration.A second referendum would create more uncertainty, the last thing business wants, and trigger a backlash from the majority who would feel cheated by the rejection of the  result. Pushing back the exit date would just prolong the anguish of this tortuous haggle with Brussels.None look capable of ­mustering support from a majority of MPs. I am struck by how many Remain voters — let alone Leavers — now just want to see Brexit done.It’s time for politicians to re-focus on boosting jobs, easing the cost of living and ensuring high-quality schools and NHS services. But the British people won’t move on from Brexit until their ­politicians keep their promises on Brexit.We’ve argued long enough. It’s time for some national self-belief.  People heard the risks and, yes, we need to manage them. But voters also expect their politicians to offer a more optimistic vision of post-Brexit Britain and grasp the opportunities.We will control our laws and our immigration policy. We will continue to trade in Europe, but broaden our global horizons — which is good for creating jobs, boosting wages, and offering UK consumers cheaper goods and wider choice.We should put rocket boosters up the economy by cutting business taxes and raise the threshold of National Insurance employee contributions to save workers more than £ each year.While we’re at it, a more robust pro-competition policy at home would give small businesses the opportunity to break into markets, end consumer rip-offs and offer customers better deals.Enough wrangling. It’s time to leave the EU and deliver a better post-Brexit UK economy for workers, small businesses and consumers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a bid for power without a mandate.Shty Dominic Grieve fancies himself as a Remain superhero, outwitting the Government to rob .million voters.He doesn’t give a damn about the little people, of course, being a grand QC and former Attorney General.But Grieve is doing catastrophic harm to his party, to Parliament and our democracy. History won’t be kind to him.The Government he is destabilising is the only prayer Leavers have.Their betrayal by Labour is close, and inevitable.Labour’s Brexit chief Keir Starmer now admits that he aims to secure a second referendum — then campaign, and vote, for Remain.If that’s not Corbyn’s policy, why isn’t Starmer fired All the chaos brings Theresa May ever closer to an election.One in which every Tory Remainer plotting to kill Brexit must be deselected and replaced.With candidates who stay loyal to voters and make promises they intend to keep.SADIQ Khan’s “poll tax” on drivers looks like the biggest disaster of his inglorious tenure as London Mayor.We know he is a lightweight who prefers virtue-signalling to fixing the city’s problems.

All those who cannot replace their old car with a “cleaner” new model will be clobbered.Which of course hits the lowest-paid hardest.

including an audacious airstrike near Damascus airport.Israeli missile defenses later intercepted an incoming missile over the Golan Heights.Until now, Israel has largely refrained from public admissions of its covert military operations in neighbouring Syria.It has been cautious to avoid large-scale involvement in the eight-year civil war there.The Syrian military said Israel carried out intensive airstrikes with successive waves of guided missiles shortly after am.But a spokesperson added that Syrian air defenses destroyed most of the missiles before they reached their targets.On Sunday, Syrian state media said air defenses repelled an Israeli air raid near the international airport south of Damascus.State TV said Syrias air defenses prevented the attack from achieving its goals.It said Israel targeted six missiles on an area near Damascus International Airport, of which five were shot down and one erted to nearby empty farmland.Residents of the capital said they heard five explosions early Sunday afternoon, apparently the sound of air defenses firing into the air.Israeli warplanes have used Lebanons airspace recently to strike deep inside Syria -

there is enough wealth in the world to provide everyone with a fair chance in le.The report said an estimated , people die every day because of a lack of healthcare, while  million of the worlds children cannot attend school.Describing billionaires as having more wealth than ever before, it said the worlds richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, could fund the health budget of Ethiopia with just one per cent of his estimated £bn fortune.It also said the poorest  per cent of people in Britain now pay a higher proportion of their incomes in tax than the richest  per cent.Criticising the report, Kate Andrews, associate director at the IoEA, said inequality and poverty are wholly dferent issues with radically dferent antidotes.She added: Capitalism has the best track record for lting people out of poverty. The past few decades alone have seen hundreds of millions of people benefit.Demonising capitalism might be a fashionable activity for the affluent but it would be a travesty, especially for the poor,calls to overthrow it were allowed to succeed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Borough of Culture is about inspiring people who might not have considered a career in the arts and unlocking their potential.“The Borough of Culture also forms part of the Mayor’s work to tackle the root causes of violent crime, as it will create cultural activities specically designed to be easily accessible to disadvantaged young Londoners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463377539.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"weight loss eat table tv dinners fuel obesity","story":"Professor Dame Sally Davies warns Brits “mindlessly” scoff too many calories when chowing down in front of the telly – fuelling the nation’s obesity epidemic.England’s chief medical officer said as well as keeping off needless pounds, social interaction over the dinner table helps boost kids’ brain power.Currently, one in three kids leaves primary school overweight or obese.Being too tubby raises risk of heart disease, type  diabetes and cancer.Speaking at an event organised by think tank Reform, Dame Sally said: “We would like people to sit down and eat together.“If you look at child development, they need to interact with their families.“Proper mealtimes with healthy food are going to help our children develop effectively and probably help our waistlines.“When people are using screens or watching the television their calorie intake goes up, because you don’t concentrate on the food, the social interaction is fairly mindless and the feeling of satiation is not recognised as easily.”Last month, Dame Sally declared herself chief nanny as she outlined radical plans to tackle obesity – including a levy on chocs and crisps.Research by University College London has previously found girls who have TVs in their bedrooms are a third more likely to be fat.Another study found teens exposed to daily junk food adverts were twice as likely to be lardy.Hugo Fry, UK managing director of pharma giant Sanofi, said Brits eat badly.Speaking at the event in London, he said: “One of the reasons that drive the UK up the obesity charts is the way we eat, and the environment we do it in.“So we are massive TV eaters, grab and go eaters.“At the other end of the chart, the French they sit down as a family at every single meal.”Research by Sanofi shows more than four in five Brits say they have a responsibility to stay healthy and cut the burden on GPs and hospitals.However, only one in four was walling to get the over-s NHS Health Check.Campaigners last night backed Dame Sally’s latest nanny state intervention.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said large numbers of families do not even own a table.He said: “Prof Dame Sally Davies is absolutely right. The real problem is we have too many families who cannot cook. So the easiest thing is to buy takeaways or ready meals and sit around the television and eat.“Families should make an effort to have the TV off around meal time and have a conversation while eating.”Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “There is some evidence to suggest watching screens can distract children from feeling full.With kids consuming the equivalent of , excess sugar cubes a year, teachers welcomed the changes — but critics warned of “fear-mongering”."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000463330216.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"31 stone plane passenger forces cabin crew to undress him in cramped loo and wipe his bum while he moaned with pleasure","story":"The disgusting incident allegedly occurred on an EVA Air long-haul flight from Los Angeles to Taiwan’s Taoyuan Airport.A flight attendant, whose surname is Kuo and was chief purser on the flight, alleged the unidentied man made her and her colleagues undress him in a lavatory and wipe his backside on January .During a press conference, the stewardess explained the series of events leading to the crew having to pull down the passenger’s pants and clean his bottom after he had finished relieving himself.Kuo said the man, who she estimated weighed kg , boarded the plane on a wheelchair and asked he be given three adjoining seats in economy class due to his size.As the flight was not full, he was granted his request.But this later allegedly escalated to a demand to use the plane’s business class lavatory, as he could not fit in the economy-size cubicle.She said the passenger claimed an injury to his right hand prevented him from fully undressing himself in order to use the lavatory.He therefore asked cabin crew to pull down his pants in order for him to successfully relieve himself.Kuo said: “I told him we couldn’t help him, but he started yelling.He told me to go in there immediately and threatened to relieve himself on the floor.But he very angrily slapped my hand away, saying he didn’t want it and only wanted me to remove his underwear so he could use the toilet.”After granting the request, they were left further traumatised when the man called them into the cubicle again in order to wipe his bottom.Kuo’s chief attendant reluctantly agreed, explaining that they did not want to leave the lone passenger trapped in the lavatory.However, the flight attendants’ discomfort then turned to humiliation when he allegedly began moaning in apparent pleasure as the chief attendant wiped his backside while wearing three pairs of latex gloves.Kuo, who was holding onto the passenger to keep in steady, recalled: “He said: ‘Oh, mmm, deeper, deeper,’ and then accused my chief attendant of not properly cleaning his backside, requesting that she do it again.”She said the attendant repeated the action three times before leaving, at which point the passenger said: “You can pull my pants back up now.”EVA Air, which only employees female cabin crew, has said in a statement its staff are not obliged to accept demands from passengers - even those requiring special assistance.However, the Taoyuan Flight Attendants Union, which is representing Kuo and her colleagues, argue that the problem is systemic, stemming from a service industry culture that frowns upon those who do not meet the customer’s every demand.The union has suggested two solutions: ban the passenger and others like him, and begin hiring male cabin staff.Further statements from the airlines and the union are expected in the coming days.The Sun Online is unable to contact the passenger for comment on the allegation.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m voluntarily withdrawing from their process.DANCING On Ice viewers can’t say they weren’t warned.“After the break,” said host Phillip Schofield, “Gemma Collins is Marilyn Monroe. Don’t go away.”A big ask. But then so’s stling a fit of the giggles when Richard Blackwood describes himself as “the king of cool”, and trying to look at Ryan Side-bottom’s Beauty and the Beast make-up without thinking of Terry Waite chained to a radiator in the Lebanon.The Gemmasaurus, though, performed at least three television miracles at Sunday’s Musicals-themed night.The first was being hoisted into the DOI rafters, on  board a giant ring, within  seconds, by the same team who got the London Eye upright.The second involved claiming the moral high ground, from Jason Gardiner, during a spectacular toddler tantrum at the end of her Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend routine.And the third, but biggest of all, was somehow getting voted through to next week’s show despite re-writing the entire history of musicals.

Nor is anyone listening when they bang on about the “tiredness, sleepless nights and blah blah blah”.The only reason I kept watching this one, in fact, was to try to establish exactly how Spencer and Vogue earn a living, as they’re one of those independently wealthy couples who give very little clue as to why they’re always so “busy, busy, busy”.It took a couple of episodes, but eventually Vogue muttered some- thing about her own fake tan range and Spencer said something even less convincing about cooking, before adding: “We bring dferent things to the table.” The urge Spencer really wants to milk, it turns out though, is a creative one. So, at the climax of episode two he’s striding into London’s Soho Theatre for an audition, with the defiant announcement: “I’m going to open or shut the door on my childhood dream of becoming an actor.”And how’s that going Make sure it bangs your a*** on the way out, Spencer.TV GOLD: The Paras: Men Of War, on ITV.

He was waving his stick around and he hit the front of my car.“I wound down the window and before I could say anything he shouted ‘Mind my dogs you f****** peasant.’ I couldn’t believe it.“I was so furious I leapt out and shouted ‘I’m no f****** peasant. Who are you calling a peasant ’Patrick said the tweed-clad gamekeeper, who was holding some dead pheasants, accused him of almost hitting his labradors and spaniels and waved a stick.He added: “I said ‘Don’t threaten me, waving your stick around.’“He replied ‘I don’t use weapons.’ I said ‘You must have used weapons to kill those birds’ and pointed at the pheasants.“He then moved off the road and the dogs followed him so the way became clear again.“I didn’t want anything to do with it so I turned my back to walk back to the car and heard someone shout ‘No! no!’“The next thing I felt a heavy thud on the back of my head then this excruciating pain.

Doctors have warned him to expect concussion. He also has cuts and bruises across both arms and his body.Patrick added: “After Prince Philip’s crash it makes it look like the Royals think they can do whatever they want.

Ah, oui, Dominique. Not as British as you might think, Grieve.Which may explain why he  is now doing such terrible damage to our national interest and to the future of our parliamentary system by trying to block Brexit. Over the two decades since he became an MP in , this pukka, posh-suited, punctilious figure has been a pedantic regular in House of Commons debates.He would crook one of his little fingers at an angle, give his neck muscles a creaky tweak and insist, with a shot of the cuffs and a shuffle of minimal notes, that ministers and officials must always comply with statute and precedent and time-honoured procedure.When giving these lectures — they were seldom short — he would touch the rim of his glasses, give a little mallard-style cough and allow a patronising smile to inhabit his broadening bill.He would explain that raw political instinct and passion, of the sort voiced by the Nigel Farages and Jeremy Corbyns of this world,  were not by themselves good enough in politics. He looked down on such things.Politicians whose demagogic brio reflected the public’s molten anger  Puh-lease, how vulgar. They did not accord with Grieve’s gods of logic.“With respect,” he would say — and it is one of the older truths of Westminster that when people say “with respect” they mean the sneery opposite — “with respect, we have to do things according to the rules, for that is the way this Parliament works and those are the sort of people we are.”I paraphrase him but that was very much Grieve’s position. He was a creature of propriety.He could cite legal sub-section and addendum and annex and codicil that proved, we were told, the unarguable merits of his position.With Monsieur half-French Grieve, the ancient principles of English law were our majesty. Our mainstay!Plenty of us clocked that Grieve was a bit of a prune, an oddball, the fogeyish son of privilege. His dad Percy, wouldn’t you know it, had also been a Tory MP of the gusset-and-sock-suspenders old school.Percy once worked as a liaison officer for French wartime hero Charles de Gaulle, who hated the British . It was said that Old Man Grieve agreed with de Gaulle.“The trouble with Percy  is that he likes foreigners  a great deal better than his own people,” concluded an acquaintance.Dominic, in childhood, worshipped his father and once won a school oratory contest by making an admiring speech about de Gaulle.Does “Dominique”, too, like continentals better than his fellow countrymen  It sure looks that way. In June , in one of the greatest thumpings our elite was ever given by the people, we voted to leave the EU. Dominic Grieve, newly decorated with France’s Legion d’honneur for his political work, was horried.Indignant. You could even say he was ag-Grieved. And so he touched the rims of his glasses, did some ducky quacking and set to work to block Brexit.The trouble, as has often been pointed out to him, was that the democratic vote had gone against him.At first he said, through gritted teeth , that he would respect the result of the referendum.In  he was re-elected as MP for prosperous Beaconsfield, Bucks,  on a Tory manesto which said exactly that.Every Tory MP promised to get us out of the customs union and single market.Labour MPs also promised to honour the referendum result. What lying bastards these people are. When the new Government started to get into political dficulties, the once-principled Grieve saw his chance. He stopped saying he would respect the referendum result. He wanted us to stay in the customs union. He wanted a second referendum.Most startling of all, he plotted to bypass all those rules and time-honoured procedures he used to say were so vital for our political safety.After a secret meeting with the appallingly biased John Bercow, Grieve got that anti-Brexit Commons Speaker to chuck out centuries of accepted debating rules.Propriety was smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Legal advice was ignored.This former Attorney General’s campaign against Brexit, which will next week see him and a minority of MPs attempt to remove law-making from the elected Government, took on a wild, crazed aspect.The possible upshots for our democratic system are terrying. When MPs stop even bothering to pretend they will honour their election promises, why should anyone vote Why not just seize power by force  It’s a recipe for anarchy on the streets.At the moment, Corbyn’s Labour Party is going along with Grieve and Bercow but Corbyn will surely eventually realise that warping parliamentary rules to stop an elected Government from governing will do him no favourshe himself becomes Prime Minister.  It always takes time for the penny to drop with dozy Corbyn.Meanwhile, we are left  with the bizarre spectacle of one-time legal details nerd Dominic Grieve going back  on everything he ever stood for, overturning ancient parliamentary conventions.All along, it seems, his loyalties were not to a rules-based system but to the blue flag of a European Union that is now, increasingly, our rival and our deadly threat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

as well as his own vote to trigger Article  - is such an impossible case to argue that he’s decided to tear up the British constitution instead.It would be a very bitter, twisted and dangerous development MPs could overturn the will of  MPs who voted to trigger Article , not to mention the .million who voted for Brexit. Nadine Dorries added: There are Europhile, kamikaze MPs in Parliament, assisted by a senior clerk and the Speaker, who would happily end their careers in flames in order to defy the will of the people and stop Brexit.A separate attempt to rule out a No Deal Brexit is being launched by a cross-party group of senior MPs.Labours Yvette Cooper and Tory Nick Boles have drawn up a bill which would see Article  delayed until the end of the yearthere isnt a Brexit deal by the end of next month.Its backed by other veteran figures such as Hilary Benn, Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin - and Jeremy Corbyn could throw his weight behind it too.Amber Rudd has reportedly told the PM thatshe blocks ministers from supporting the bill, dozens of them could quit in protest.Then on Tuesday January , the PM must hold a debate where MPs will have their say on her plan.Although the debate will be on a so-called neutral motion, stating only that the Commons has considered her statement, MPs will have the power to table amendments dictating what should happen next.GRIEVE AMENDMENT - WRECKING BREXITDominic Grieve has proposed an amendment which would effectively transfer power from the Government to the Commons.Under the terms of his proposal, Article  could be suspended indefinitely - keeping us in the EU - on the say-so of  MPs, which is less than a majority.The MPs would have to come from at least five dferent parties, with a minimum of five Conservatives involved.The amendment would tear up centuries of precedent by limiting the Governments ability to govern and so is unlikely to succeed.COOPER BILL - NINE-MONTH DELAYYvette Cooper is tabling a bill to stop Britain leaving the EU without a deal on March .She proposes thatthere isnt a deal by February , MPs could delay Article  for nine months - giving ministers until the end of the  to secure a withdrawal agreement.The bill is a standalone law, but an amendment to the PMs statement could see it catapulted to the top of the Commons agenda.Jeremy Corbyn is considering supporting the move, which would give it a good chance of passing.DROMEY SPELMAN AMENDMENT - BLOCKING NO DEALTory Caroline Spelman and Labours Jack Dromey have a separate amendment to prevent a No Deal outcome.The pair, who both represent Britains industrial heartland in the Midlands, would simply see the Government declare that Britain wont quit the EU until a deal is in place.CABLE AMENDMENT - SECOND REFERENDUMLib Dem boss Vince Cable has come up with a way of forcing a second referendum on Brexit via a Commons amendment.The motion would see Mrs Mays deal approved, but only on the condition that the Government holds a referendum letting the public choose between her plan and staying in the EU.Ms Cooper today claimed Mrs May is keen for the bill to succeed because she secretly wants No Deal off the table.She told the BBC: I think she knows that she should rule out No Deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging.Shes refusing to do so and I think shes hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership.If No Deal is ruled out, it may encourage Brexiteer MPs to back Mrs Mays deal - or risk Britain staying in the EU permanently.The Government is currently spending more than £, an hour on preparing for a possible No Deal, according to Labour.So far ministers have paid out £.billion making sure the country is ready to leave without a deal - even though Mrs May is adamant she will get a deal.Jeremy Corbyn said: We’re ready to talk to the Government and others in Parliament about a sensible alternative plan, but not while Theresa May is wasting £, an hour of taxpayers’ money on dangerous and unnecessary No Deal brinkmanship.Today the PM will be grilled on her plans to change her deal so it gets past the Commons despite last weeks humiliating defeat.Then next Tuesday MPs will have a chance to vote on the proposals - giving them a chance to dictate what happens next.A PRO-EU minister today vowed hell QUITTheresa May ends up going for a No Deal Brexit.Business Minister Richard Harrington claimed leaving the EU without a deal would be an absolute disaster and called on the PM to rule it out.He suggested large firms such as Jaguar Land Rover would be driven out of the country in a No Deal outcome.Mr Harrington told the BBC: Ive seen what may well happen with this cut-off date.Crashing out, in my view, is an absolute disaster -

No progress on what Brexit means.And veteran MP Hillary Benn blasted her for failing to listen to what opposition politicians wanted, saying: While her door may have been open, her mind remains closed.The PM told MPs:Mrs May said she would be speaking to the DUP this week and other colleagues, and will go back to Brussels to tell them what is needed to get the deal over the line.We will work to identy how we can ensure that our commitment to no hard border in Northern Ireland and Ireland can be delivered in a way that commands the support of this House, and the European Union, she promised.But Labour boss Jeremy Corbyn asked what hope she had of getting the deal passed after she failed to do so last month.This really does feel like Groundhog Day, he said.Some ministers think that the best way forward is to get Leavers on side to win over Tories and the DUP - rather than reaching out to Labour MPs who want a customs union with the bloc and a softer Brexit.Yesterday key Brexiteer Jacob Rees Mogg suggested hed rather back the deal than risk not leaving altogether.He said this morning: If the backstop could be removed altogether, so could most of the problems be removed.Mrs May also used her speech to slam reports that she could consider reopening the controversial and hard won Good Friday Agreement.The PM stressed: I never never even considered doing so, and neither would I, she said.She also took aim at Jeremy Corbyn for failing to engage in talks to get a Brexit deal done.Last week the Labour boss said he wouldnt talk to her about leaving the EU because shes refused to take No Deal Brexit off the table.Mrs May said she hoped that he would reflect on his decision and said we should all be prepared to work together to get a deal done.He says no more phoney talks - it would be nice to have at least some talks with him! she joked.It would be welcomed by big business - but Brexit voters would be unhappy because it would mean Britain accepting open borders, and following European rules without a say.HOW LIKELY   HARD AS NAILSMost of the Tory Brexiteers who oppose the PMs deal want her toto Brussels and strike a tougher line.But Eurocrats currently insist its impossible to re-open negotiations.HOW LIKELY   REFERENDUM RE-RUNDozens of MPs are hell-bent on forcing Mrs May to hold a second referendum so Britain can stay in the EU.Yet without the support of the Government its unlikely the second vote could become a reality.HOW LIKELY   DEAL OR NO DEAL If Mrs May cannot pass a deal, the legal default is that we will leave the EU without a deal on March .Despite the legal position, the majority of MPs insist they will take any measure necessary to rule out No Deal.HOW LIKELY   MAY TRIUMPHS - EVENTUALLYCabinet ministers remain adamant that a version of Theresa Mays plan will eventually pass the Commons, even after losing last night.They believe sceptical MPs will lose their nerve as Brexit Day approaches - terried of either No Deal or a second referendum.HOW LIKELY   Today Remainers are launching a move to seize control of the Brexit process.Amendments are being discussed today on what should happen next - one plan would be to give backbenchers control, and another would force article  to be extended.The world now knows that Michel Barnier never negotiated in good faith. He reportedly boasted: “I’ll have done my jobthe exit terms are so bad that the British would rather stay.”Yet Remainers want to capitulate anyway: to scrap or “extend” Article , risibly pretending it’s a pragmatic solution instead of what they wanted all along.They would force on us a dangerous second referendum, or some vague pause to avoid No Deal, disgracefully backed by Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd and other Remainer Ministers.The tactics are so undemocratic the Queen might have to block them. That’s right, these MPs could force our monarch, in her rd year, into the worst constitutional crisis for three centuries.Mrs May is now taking the only good option short of No Deal — toto Brussels and renegotiate the backstop.The EU may refuse.

But out of the ashes, a string of radically dferent Plan B options are taking shape - and will wrestle for control in the Commons. The Prime Ministers own Plan B will go head to head with plans from Remain-backing MPs that could delay Brexit or stop it altogether. Labour wants to leave with a customs union, while other Remainers want to force a second EU referendum. Importantly, MPs will hold a vote on some of these options at pm on Tuesday  January - giving Theresa May a mandate toto the EU. Although the vote on her neutral motion isnt binding - what would be called an indicative vote - it will spell the way forward. So what are the biggest amendments that have been proposed so far and what will they do  Heres our rolling guide, which well continue to update as the vote draws near. Theresa Mays Plan B: Rework the Irish backstop and go back to EU in February   Theresa May ed to MPs on Monday  January to outline her own Plan B. She suggested she simply wants to tweak her -page Brexit deal - including a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules - instead of ripping the whole thing up. The PM did not categorically rule out the customs union demanded by Labour - or, crucially, extending the  March date of Brexit. But she tried to rebuff calls for a customs union, a second referendum, ruling out No Deal, or revoking or extending the  March date of Brexit. Mrs May said she will continue with further meetings this week and consult this House on its negotiating mandate before ing to the EU to try and agree a further Plan B. She also offered confidential briefings to MPs on the way forward, guarantees on workers rights, and consultation with parliaments committees. Yet key figures in the EU savaged Mrs Mays Plan B pleas as party politics. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told MPs: The Prime Ministers invitation to talks has been exposed as a PR sham. Contrary to what the Prime Minister just said there was no flexibility, there were no negotiations - nothing hadchanged.  Labour: Give MPs a say on all options - including Labours deal and a second voteJeremy Corbyns party has tabled an amendment which calls for Parliament to have a say on all the options. Two of those should include Labours own Brexit plans which is a Norway plus style agreement and also the option for a second referendum or public voted. Keir Starmer boosted the hopes of Labour supporters of a second referendum at the weekend when he confirmed the party was now at the final stage of its Brexit plan as set out in its September conference. Labour believes its version of Brexit which would include a permanent customs union, relationship with the single market and alignment on rights and standards would command a majority in the House of Commons.  Party sources say the amendment is in line with the partys conference motion. In recent weeks the leadership has insisted that all options remain on the table. But there are a growing number of Labour MPs who want a second vote - while more than % of the partys membership also back another poll. Including the option of a second vote should go some way to keeping those MPs on side.Jeremy Corbyn said: Our amendment will allow MPs to voteon options to end this Brexit deadlock and prevent the chaos of a No Deal. It is time for Labours alternative plan to take centre stage, while keeping all options on the table, including the option of a public vote.   One amendment seeks to suspend Article  - which sets the  March date of Brexit -there is no new deal by the end of February. It is being led by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Nick Boles, both Remain-backers. Ms Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: I think sheknows that she should rule out no deal in the national interest because it would be so damaging. Shes refusing to do so and I think shes hoping that Parliament will do this for her - that is not leadership. Dominic Grieve: Backbenchers can take control of them agree   A second, more radical amendment, drawn up by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, would allow something big. MPs would be able to take control of the timetable in the House of Commons - by a minority voting for it. Usually the government has control of the agenda in the Commons, which stops backbenchers going rogue and passing laws. But under Mr Grieves plan,formal business it proposed by at least  of the  MPs - from at least five parties and including  Tories - it would be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day. Downing Street figures branded it a coup. But Mr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to vote on a string of alternatives. These could include a soft Norway-style deal or a second referendum. Alliance of the forces of enlightenmentSupporters of the two plans are understood to have agreed to come together. One MP involved in the discussions told HuffPo: “It looks like the forces of enlightenment will be advancing on several compatible fronts when it comes to amendments.” It is understood the two camps will table compatible motions.These stand a good chance of passing with the combined weight of supporters for both amendments and the support of the Labour leadership.The Labour leader told the Commons on Monday: “We will, as we have said consistently from the beginning, back amendments that seek to rule out the disaster of no deal.” Plus - how the Queen could get dragged in   Theresa May could drag the Queen into a showdown with Parliament,MPs try to cancel or postpone Brexit. Former top government lawyer Sir Stephen Laws said trying to change the law in this way through an amendment, without the Government’s participation, could create a constitutional crisis. In a paper for the Policy Exchange think tank, Sir Stephen said: “It could raise a question whether the Government would be entitled or might feel required to reassert its constitutional veto by advising the Queen not to grant Royal Assent to the Bill. “How should the Monarch react to such advice  The answer is not straightforward and the prospect of it needing to be considered in a real le political crisis is unthinkably awful. “It is a sacred duty of all UK politicians not to involve the Monarch in politics.

The Prime Minister was forced toto Parliament to give details of her next step after she lost a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement by  votes - the biggest government defeat ever. Mrs May, who has met with several opposition leaders and senior MPs, has attacked Mr Corbyn for refusing to meet her. But the Labour leader, who has refused to meet while no deal remains a possibility, dismissed the Prime Ministers invitation to talks as a PR sham. He told the Commons: Every opposition party politician came out of those meetings with the same response. Contrary to what the Prime Minister has just said, there was no flexibility there were no negotiations nothing had changed.  The Prime Minister has so far reiterated her desire to seek assurances on the Irish backstop from the EU in order to change the parliamentary arithmetic rather than opting for a softer Brexit which many believe would command a majority in the House of Commons. Mrs May told MPs that two main issues remained with the backstop - the fear that we could be trapped in it permanently and concerns over its potential impact on our UnionNorthern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of the UK.   The Prime Minister has already spent months seeking concessions from the EU with little success. The EUs assurances set out in a letter from, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker are not legally binding. And today senior figures in the EU have dismissed her pleas as “party politics” warning Mrs May they would not make any compromises unless they could be sure the PM had the numbers to get the deal through parliament.   Today Mr Corbyn said it felt like Groundhog Day as he asked the PM: What makes her think that what she tried to renegotiate in December will succeed in January  Instead he insisted that there was the possibility of a better deal -the PM changed her red lines. And he rejected Mrs Mays assertion that the option for the UK is her deal or no deal. But our EU negotiating partners are clear and I quote: Unanimously the European Council have always said thatthe UK chooses to sht its red lines in the future ... and to go beyond a simple free trade agreement, then the EU will be immediately ready to give a favourable response.

Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. It only appliesthere is no Brexit deal. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March .

But Labours shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK aviation sector. The Government must immediately reassure the aviation industry that its operating environment will not change after March .Theresa May has to listen to the majority of MPs, as well as members of her own cabinet, and take no-deal off the table.

The publication issued the alert after studying the websites of easyJet, Thomas Cook Airlines and TUI Airways. Its editor, Rory Boland, told the Press Association: There were no warnings through the booking process on any of those sites about possible cancellations or passport validity. Proposed no-deal guidance from the EU Commission published last month stated thatflightsbetween the UK and EU should continue for  months in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but UK airlines would not be allowed to add new routes or increase frequencies. Airports Council International predicted that -the policy was also applied by the UK to EU airlines - it would ultimately result in the loss of , newflightsand nearly  million airport passengers on the UK-EU market.  Mr Boland said: We think airlines should be more upfront that someflightsmay not be able to depart in the case of a no-deal because it would give potential customers the opportunity to change their plans. That could mean booking a package holiday ... or they may decide theyll still buy the flight but they wont purchase their hotels or car hire until a later date when theyre sure thoseflightsare going to depart. Its giving passengers more information so they can make a better, informed decision about their holidays.  Travellers will need to have at least six months left on their passport from the date of arrival in EU countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Boland claimed the Government should be warning people more proactively about the change. He said: The issue will come when everybody suddenly realises as the Easter holidays approach and then theres a mass of applications and the passport office cant handle it. They should be telling people to get those applications in early. What industry associations say about your tickets A spokesman for industry association Airlines UK said: “We have had clarity from both the UK Government and EU that even in the event of a no-deal Brexit air travel will continue. This is in addition to the excellent progress Government has made in concluding bilateral agreements with third countries – including the United States and Canada. It is true there is some detail in the Commission’s no-deal Regulations that we are seeking urgent clarity on – and we have always said we would not support a no-deal outcome – and we remain hopeful that common sense will prevail.” ABTA, the trade body for UK travel agents, said: The European Commission and the UK Government have both said that, even in a no-deal scenario, flights will continue to operate between the UK and the EU. The limitation on flights at the same levels as  is yet to be agreed - it is a proposal that is still to be voted on by Members of the European Parliament who will have to take into account the impact on their own economies. Once further clarity is provided, airlines and travel businesses will wish to review what the impacts may be. In any event, people who book a package holiday have the greatest level of protection as it is down to their travel company to make sure their holiday is provided or offer a full refundthat is not possible. What the government says A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: We are committed to ensuring thatflightsbetween the UK and EU continue, and the European Commission has published a proposal to make sure this happens. This clearly shows that in the event of no deal, both sides are committed to maintaining connectivity. These combined reassurances should allow businesses and passengers to continue to book and travel with confidence.

The Prime Minister told MPs she will press the EU for more concessions on the unpopular backstop. Government insiders said they hope the EU would be spooked by the clock running down to a no-deal scenario. But it was far from clear that the bloc was willing to give enough ground. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said nothing had changed, despite the PM’s deal being rejected by a record margin last week. He said: “What makes her think what she tried to renegotiate in December will succeed in January  This really does feel like Groundhog Day.”  There was just one major U-turn, with Mrs May saying she was scrapping the pound fee for EU citizens to stay after Brexit, at a cost of poundmillion. Otherwise, the changes were cosmetic. There was little detail on her offer of legal protections for workers’ rights and environmental safeguards and she refused to rule out leaving with no deal as it would not be “honest”. And she suggested a second referendum could “damage social cohesion” by undermining faith in democracy. MPs countered that her approach to Brexit was causing the real ision. Downing Street later denied Mrs May was suggesting there could be riots. The PM also fuelled speculation she plans to delay Brexit Day by refusing to explicitly rule out extending Article . When pressed, she rowed back from a previous commitment to say she was working on a deal “such that we can leave” the bloc.  Welfare Secretary Amber Rudd has warned dozens of ministers are ready to quit next week unless no-deal Brexit is ruled out. The Remainer believes ministers should get a free vote on extending Article . With cross-party talks stalling, the PM’s bid to break the deadlock looked doomed. Senior Tories persuaded her any attempt to compromise with Labour would terminally split their party. Instead, her focus was on offering Brexit bribes to the DUP and hardline MPs over the backstop on the Irish border – and the overtures showed early signs of working. The DUP’s Nigel Dodds praised the PM for “good engagement” and “willingness to try and reach a consensus”. Insiders clung to suggestions from Poland of a five-year time limit on backstop plans. But EU chiefs once again ruled out any changes. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said Mrs May already had the “best possible” deal. And Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney said a backstop end-date did not represent EU thinking.  Tory Remainers were furious at the PM’s bid to win over Brexiteers and Anna Soubry said: “Here we are with another week of can-kicking – and the truth is, shynothing’s changed.” Sarah Wollaston added: “It’s like last week’s vote never happened. Plan B is Plan A.” Labour MPs were also angry, with Angela Eagle accusing the PM of “playing chicken” with her own shyBrexiteers and the DUP. It came as senior backbenchers began tabling amendments to the Brexit plan to let MPs take control. Labour’s Yvette Cooper was planning a move to delay departure and leading Tory rebel Dominic Grieve plans for MPs to get an “indicative vote” to seeany other deal option could win a majority. But they both need Mr Corbyn’s backing and the Labour leadership is eyeing all proposals with caution. Downing Street said Parliament was unlikely to have a second binding vote on the PM’s deal until February – playing down the shyimportance of next week’s vote. Meanwhile, former Government lawyer Sir Stephen Laws said the PM could drag the Queen into a showdown with ParliamentMPs try to cancel or postpone Brexit – but this could create a constitutional crisis.

She told the Commons: It was clear that the governments approach had to change - and it has. And she insisted that meetings with opposition MPs were held in a constructive spirit without pre-conditions.The main announcement was to scrap the pound fee for EU citizens to stay in the UK after Brexit. It comes after the Home Office unveiled new details of its settlement scheme for .million EU citizens living in the UK. But her statement revealed that very little of substance had actually changed.The Prime Minister has been seeking changes to the Irish backstop - a major stumbling block for many MPs.  But Dublin has rejected Downing Streets bid to get concessions on what they see as a key mechanism to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland. And key figures in Europe have dismissed her pleas as “party politics”. She told MPs that two main issues remained with the backstop - the fear that we could be trapped in it permanently and concerns over its potential impact on our UnionNorthern Ireland is treated dferently from the rest of the UK. Mrs May told MPs she would be speaking with parliamentary colleagues, including members of the DUP, to see how the government can meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House. The PM said she will then take the conclusions of those discussion back to the EU. But key European figures have already warned Mrs May they would not make any compromises unless they could be sure the PM had the numbers to get the deal through parliament.  On Monday morning Downing Street rejected claims they were considering changes to the  Good Friday Agreement, which brought an end to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the spokesman said: No. The Prime Minister has been clear on multiple occasions that we are committed to upholding the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and to delivering a solution that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The Prime Minister reiterated that denial saying: I have never even considered doing so – and neither would I.   They also rejected the idea of a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Ireland, which was reportedly being consideredn by Number  as a way to ensure the backstop would not be needed. The PMs spokesman said: Its not something we are looking at. European Parliament vice-president Mairead McGuinness, an MEP for Taoiseach Leo Varadkars Fine Gael party, said a new treaty between the UK and Ireland to replace the backstop was not an option. And theEUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who held talks with Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney in Brussels, ruled out the prospect of a separate deal between London and Dublin, telling RTE: As you know ... we are working  as a team, a single team and we negotiate as one. Meanwhile a senior member of Angela Merkels Government, industry minister Peter Altmaier, warned against trying theEUs patience for political reasons. Sympathy, patience and readiness to wait until the UKs position will be claried are of utmost important to avoid the worst, warned Mr Altmaier. They should not be misused for party politics. Large majority wants to exclude hard Brexit - in the interest of the UK and beyond.  While Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth urged Britain to “think about it again” and stay in the European Union.There was a glimmer of hope for Theresa May as Polands foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz suggested the deadlock could be broken by setting a five-year time limit on the backstop. He told Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita: If Ireland asked theEUto amend the agreement with the British on the backstop so that it would apply temporarily - lets say five years - the matter would be solved. It would obviously be less favourable for Ireland than an indefinite backstop, but much more advantageous than no-deal Brexit. Mr Czaputowicz said that London and Dublin were playing chicken over the border and risked a head-on collision in which Ireland stood to lose the most. But theEuropean Commission made clear that Brussels believes the ball is now in Londons court on Brexit. A spokesman told reporters: Dont look for answers from Brussels. Now is the moment for London to speak, not for us.

Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said: It is obviously disappointing to learn of this development, but it also adds an interesting element to its story.   That it so closely copies a regional monument type shows the local knowledge, appreciation and engagement with the archaeology of the region by the local community.

One  failed a fire test in Dubai which should have lasted at least an hour after just  minutes. But families were not told for weeks and the firm which built the X shyEastlands block in Manchester tried to cover up the shock results. Fire safety expert Geoff Wilkinson said: “It is immoral.” With the furore from Grenfell still raging, residents of other tower blocks would expect to be toldtheir buildings have similar shycladding to that in the killer blaze. But families living in one were kept in the dark after  covering their homes failed a fire test within just two months of the inferno – a move branded “immoral” by safety experts. And there was fury as the firm that built the block tried to “cover up” the shocking results by demanding those who carried out the examination signed non-disclosure agreements. Leaked test footage handed to the Mirror showed flames leaping up a replica cladded wall within  minutes and reaching temperatures of more than C –  minutes quicker than the recommended guidelines. The exercise was abandoned after  minutes over safety fears. But residents at the eight-storey X Eastbank block in Manchester were not told about the test until seven week later, when we approached them.  Construction firm Forrest went into shyadministration allegedly without passing the damning test report on to the buildings’ owners. It comes as latest government figures show just five out of  private residential blocks have had their Grenfell-style shycladding, or aluminium composite material, removed.  Building inspector and fire safety expert Geoff Wilkinson said: “If this building failed its test so quickly then that is indicating that there is a risk of external fire spread. The correct and moral thing to do is to remove the cladding and replace it.   “The moral thing is certainly to make the residents aware. It is immoral not to have notied someone there is an issue and that you are putting measures in place. You should be aiming to review the information and putting shymeasures in place within a week or two at the most.” Resident Kostas shyDespotelis, , added: “We have heard nothing about this test. It is worrying.” shy Neighbour Nadia Elzenaty said: “We were not aware of this. I knew a lot of companies were testing this cladding after the fire at Grenfell. It is shydisappointing. X should have someone chasing this up.  “They have a duty of care. There are a lot of tenants in this building. I know it is expensive to fix but you cannot undo the damage of lives lost.” Building regulations require a -minute fire protection barrier between shyapartments in a block. In August , Eastbank was found to have potentially dangerous cladding in a fire brigade shyinspection. But a blaze spread test was not carried out until  months later. Emails seen by the Mirror show the Dubai-based testing firm told Forrest on November : “The assembly fire test was conducted today at our facility.  “Please be informed that the assembly did not meet the acceptable criteria stated in BR  classication standard [for fire performance of external thermal insulation].” Forrest, which was in financial shydficulty, did not pay for the test in full and two weeks later demanded the firm signed a NDA. It wrote: “It’s a v simple shydocument, it merely says that you won’t pass details of the test on to rd parties.” A representative of the testing firm replied: “Why is this requiredForrest is taking the appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the building and its residents  “Signing the NDA blind would then implicate me in any cover up … I am not prepared to allow the people living in that building to be exposed to that kind of risk.” A Forrest employee replied on December  that “unless the NDA is signed we are reluctant to pay it. That’s the position of our main board not me personally”. Nick Sweeney, chief executive officer at X Developments, which owns the property, confirmed his firm knew the test had taken place and had been “made aware” of the shypreliminary findings received by Forrest. He said Forrest had “indicated that the [cladding] assembly did not meet the BR  classication” but had not handed over the test report. Mr Sweeney insisted additional fire safety measures were put in place when the cladding was first identied, including a “waking watch” to alert tenants to evacuate a fire. He said the building was “safe and habitable”. He added: “We’ve been awaiting the final report so we can then consider what works are required to the building.  “X have received a preliminary statement from Forrest but the draft report had not been provided to X prior to you providing the redacted version of the draft report. “We are meeting our professional team to discuss its contents and we will be putting in place such shyremediation strategy as is necessary. “X has delivered letters via email and through a hand delivery through each door informing the residents that the cladding system is being tested and informing them of the enhanced fire safety which has been adopted. “X has agreed an enhanced fire strategy with the fire officer which will remain until the testing has been completed andrequired any shyremedial works undertaken. “X was not aware of the emails between Forrest and [the testing company] nor of the NDA. The NDA is irrelevant to X as we will not be bound by it and will be providing, as we have done to date, full shyinformation we hold to both the fire officer and the government department.” Since being contacted by the Mirror, X has announced it “will be removing the cladding which is affixed to part of the exterior of the building and replacing it with a new system”. The administrators of Forrest would not comment.  Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said Eastbank was inspected in  and the shycladding was “considered to present a risk of external fire spread”. A spokesman added: “A change to the evacuation strategy was agreed. A number of actions were agreed including the provision of a waking watch in line with guidance from the Government and this was shyimplemented immediately.” The fire service will now “monitor plans to remove and replace the cladding”. X Eastbank, where the  flats cost between pound and pound, a month to rent, was completed in . The Grenfell blaze was started by a faulty fridge freezer at the block in North Kensington, West London, on June , . It spread up the external cladding on the -storey council building, killing  people. Police are considering offences including shycorporate manslaughter. The tragedy sparked a review of building safety. The Ministry for Housing, shyCommunities and Local Government identied  high-rise blocks with ACM [aluminium composite material] cladding, including the  privately-owned ones. Apart from the five private towers that had it removed, figures released last week showed work was underway on another nine. Owners of  blocks said they had “remediation plans in place”, while  “intended” to remediate. But in  buildings shyremediation plans were “unclear”. The Government has spent poundmillion replacing such  on social housing but private owners are accused of lagging behind. Mr Sweeney said X had removed ACM at two blocks but did not reveal whether other X buildings had been identied with the shycladding.

Mum Adrian Hoare, , placed Alfie Lamb in the back footwell of the car before her boyfriend Stephen Waterson, , deliberately forced his seat back against him, it has been alleged. Alfie died three days later after suffering a cardiac arrest at the home he shared with the couple in Croydon, south London. Waterson and Hoare lied repeatedly after the event and assaulted the two other passengers, in the Audi A, in a bid to cover up their crime, the Old Bailey has heard. The driver, Marcus Richardson, was later assaulted and threatened by Waterson, while Hoare slapped Emilie Williams across the face two weeks after Alfies death, it is claimed.   Mr Richardson - also known as Marcus Lamb - told jurors that Waterson assaulted him two weeks later because he had given police the number plate of the car. He was arrested and questioned about Alfies death on March . Hoares defence barrister, Tana Adkin, asked Mr Richardsonhe blamed Waterson for Alfies death when questioned by police. He replied: No I didnt blame anyone. It was the truth. Jurors heard how paramedics arrived, where the group had got out the car to discover Alfie was unconscious.  They found Mr Richardson giving Alfie CPR while Waterson was nowhere to be seen. Ms Adkin asked whether Waterson had taken Emilies child away to shield her from the scene. Mr Richardson replied: No, Steven ran off and said he could not deal with it all so left me to deal with the ambulance. I did not see Steven take the other child. She was right next to Adrian in Emilies arms. Ms Adkin said: Steven said he took the child up to the flat. Is that right  No, he replied. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson has told the court Alfie had been fit and well until he got in the Audi on February  last year.  He continued: It follows that during that car journey something happened to Alfie to compress his chest and abdomen so that he went from and active toddler, to a very seriously ill and brain damaged one. The pathologist found that Alfie had died as a result of crush asphyxia. He was squashed by the car seat and suffocated.  This movement was a deliberate action by Waterson who was angered by the noise and fuss that a three and a half year old was making during the journey. Hoare and Waterson, from Croydon, south London, both deny manslaughter. Hoare further denies charges of child cruelty for placing Alfie in the footwell and common assault on Emilie Williams on February . Photos shown to the jury show the footwell of the car after the alleged act.  Waterson further denies intimidating Marcus Lamb, also known as Marcus Richardson, on February . But Hoare and Waterson, have admitted perverting the course by submitting  statements to police. The trial continues.

The Queens strength and stay of  years was killed after he stopped his Land Rover at a junction and was hit by a second vehicle...Or perhaps: A Greek migrant is being hunted by police after crashing into a car carrying a young mum and baby on their way home from a day at the beach. The identity of the man, considered a menace by local road users, is known to officers. It is thought he is married to a local woman, although it is not clear whether he has a legal right to remain in the UK...Or even: Third-in-line to the throne Prince George escaped unscathed after his mum the Duchess of Cambridges car was in a smash on a death-trap road. The woman driver of the other vehicle, who also had a child in the back seat, was breath-tested at the scene... The fact a -year-old was involved in a collision has been used to demand older people resit their driving tests, have their licenses revoked and or be confined to barracks.But as the RAC has quite reasonably pointed out,you revoked the right to drive of those people most likely to have a smash, it would mean young people had the most to lose.So imagine a younger household name was involved: Road safety campaigners demanded footballer Raheem Sterling be jailed after a car smash with a young mum and baby. The controversial midfielder, , was seen getting behind the wheel again just a day later, and our exclusive pictures PROVE he didnt even wear a seatbelt. Young people are a bloody menace on the roads, said Prince Philip, while unveiling a plaque just a mile from the crash scene...But the problem isnt age. The problem is us, and our attitude to royalty. Had Raheem Sterling broken a womans wrist in a car accident, leaving her to get washed and dressed with help of her teenaged son, facing two months off work and possible surgery to rebreak the bones and a letime of that wrist never being quite right again, she wouldnt expect his girlfriend to send flowers. Anyone in that situation would more likely be spitting tacks at the thoughtless arsehole who caused a painful injury to a complicated joint that will require a year of rehabilitation, and would be demanding the insurance company screw him for every last penny.And theyd never expect a personal apology, on the grounds everyone in an accident knows admitting responsibility is something best left to the lawyers. The victim probably wouldnt say it could all be resolved with a phone call from Raheem askingshe was all right, because shes such a big fan of Man City.  And had Prince Philip been just about anyone , the accident might not have happened.The Royals do not know what traffic is, because they are never stuck in it. There are chauffeurs, advanced driving experts, and motorcycle outriders ensuring that they can whizz up the hard shoulder, shoot through the lights and ignore the right of way. When Philip drove his own London taxi to get around the capital, it was so he could AVOID traffic.When they get to wherever theyre going, the gates are open. Someone salutes. People wave. Everyone keeps clear of the wheels, which, of course, are always clean. You will never see a Royal in a car that has fingermarks in the weeks worth of road splatter around the doors. Youll never see their wing mirror with a ding or the wipers on their last swipe. Prince Andrew has been accused of ramming gates with his car at Windsor, and knocking over a police officer at the gates of Buckingham Palace. Princess Anne has been done for speeding at mph, and when Prince Edward was courting Sophie Rhys Jones her neighbours got used to ing into hedges to avoid being mown down as he whizzed along the country lane leading to her family home.They all do it. If that family lived in a Hackney high-rise, theyd all have an ASBO. Perhapsthey had experiences more like the rest of us, then when he pulled up to a T-junction where the sun was dazzling his vision the Duke of Edinburgh would have stopped until he could see there was no traffic.Someone with no experience of traffic, though, would assume the road was empty and just pull out. Andsomeone that daft and entitled was behind the wheel of what was literally an armoured vehicle - regardless of their age - theyd get nicked by police. If they had been ploughing into other cars on a semi-regular basis throughout their driving career, theyd get taken to court.Andthe police actually LIVED with them and spoke to them EVERY DAY, it would happen in minutes. Royals have always, traditionally, been pretty deadly. When they were around, serfs were more likely to be beaten, maids certain to be ravished, and large public protests far more likely to see their leaders run through with a sword. Wars were inevitable with every marital breakdown or romantic refusal.Removing some of their powers was a great idea, but giving them -wheel drive and several tons of moving metal to fling about the countryside at whim probably wasnt. The problem weve got is that we treat the Royals like a dferent species, and are disgusted when they act like one.We want manners and Britishness but we get rude Prussians, with fat fingers and tin ears. We bow and scrape and curtsey and mutter about why they arent a little more thoughtful, while removing from their lives all things that require deep thought - careers, taxation, a lack of opportunity.As long as we have a Royal Family that is allowed to own the place, they will continue to act like they do. Butwe demanded they had lives more like ours, they wouldnt be Royal any more - thered be nothing special about them, or perhaps more importantly us. Thats why we put up with them we like to think it rubs off.There is a solution, though: remove the gates from their palaces so they cant get out. Theyd still have lots of space to drive around, theres no traffic to bother them, and we all get to live another day."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolboy 16 london council estate","story":"NewsSchoolboy, , from London council estate wins £, Eton College scholarshipState school student and East End lad Hamid Patel, , has become an rising political star and is heading to the private school favoured by the royalsShareCommentsByTom BarnesMatthew Young:,  JAN NewsHasan Patel has earned a paid place to top private school Eton favoured by the famous \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager who shares a two-bed council flat with four family members has won a pound, scholarship to Eton.

Multimillionaire heiress Stephanie Scolaro spoke out hours after being spared jail for ordering snake-skin baseball caps and travel bags worth over pound, from Indonesia. The influential Instagram star, who has , followers, sold the goods on a website called SS Python or to other fashion outlets. Scolaro, who was today given a -hour community order, has now claimed to have been singled-out because of her lestyle and said it would have been dferentshe was a man in his s.  It’s just because I have a lot of followers and because of my lestyle, the -year-old told The Sun. It’s not asI killed a snake. She also hit back at the remark made by Judge Michael Gledhill QC in which he called her a utterly self-centred. Scolaro said she always goes out her way to help people and did not know what she was doing was wrong or that the animals were an endangered species. She added: “The funny thing is I’ve always been an animal lover, I would never harm a fly. I’ve always been against animal cruelty.   “I’ve been portrayed as an animal killer when I’m not. Loads of people walk around London wearing fur, but that’s not who I am. Scolaro claims to have been sent threats online, including by people saying they want to throw acid in her face. She now wants to part of an animal rights campaign to educate people so they can learn from her mistake. Judge Gledhill told the influencer he took a very dim view of the wildle crimes and said it was like trading in ivory from elephants and rhinos.   He said: This is a young woman who, for all sorts of dferent reasons, is utterly self-centred - her entire le concentrated around herself. One of the reasons is all her le she has in effect been given exactly what she wanted. She thinks I like python skins, I can get them and sell them, and therefore I do it. She focuses the spotlight on herself, its all about me. There is no thought about pythons in Indonesia, how they are skinned alive and how they are endangered doesnt cross her mind.   Scolaro, of central London, claims she is a socialite who leads a le of luxury and glamour as one of the rich kids of Instagram, and shares pictures of high-end designer clothes and supercars. Her sister Lana starred in the Channel  reality TV show Rich Kids Of Instagram after parading their jet-set lestyles on social media. Their father Francesco Scolaro made millions from mining and investing in the leisure industry. Scolaro pleaded guilty to two counts of importing goods with the intent to evade a prohibition, two counts of keeping for sale a species acquired unlawfully and two counts of selling a species unlawfully imported at an earlier hearing.   A selection of gold, cream and maroon snake-skin baseball caps were shown to the court. There were  illegal snake-skin goods which included baseball caps, large hold-all bags and smaller bags. An investigation was launched when German customs intercepted  caps and a large and small bag as they were air freighted from Indonesia to the UK. Prosecutor Gregor McKinley said at an earlier hearing: One of those caps was on sale there and the owner of that shop said he paid Miss Scolaro pound for it but her suggested retail price was pound. As part of the police investigation, caps addressed to her were confiscated at Heathrow Airport while five were found in another shop on sale for hundreds of pounds.   The prosecutor said: Three were on sale for pound and two were on sale for pound. Mr McKinley said Scolaro refused to cooperate in locating the goods and gave a no comment interview. He said: All of the investigation has been by the police from the website and the Instagram account and without any cooperation from the defendant for finding this items and where they have been on sale. There are some  of these baseball caps. If we take the retail value as was suggested by the defendant herself, it amounts to about pound, the value of these hats comes to pound,. The large bags which were intercepted were advertised on the website for pound,.   We dont have an estimated value for the small bags but the large bags and hats comes to pound,. When the goods came from Indonesia they had documents purporting to be export permits with them. But Mr McKinley said: Both of these documents have been checked and both are forgeries. The maximum penalties on the regulatory offences is five years on each of these offences. And the customs and excise management offence is a maximum of seven years. A hearing to recover her criminal profits will be heard at the court at a date to be fixed.

The ice is melting quicker than experts previously thought, and they say it will likely lead to faster sea level rises, due to the continued, accelerating warming of the Earths atmosphere. The study flies in the face of US President Donald Trump who has repeatedly denied the scientic consensus on climate change. He once claimed the phenomenon was a Chinese hoax intended to hurt American exports. Researchers concerned about global sea level rises have focused on Greenland, where large glaciers stream iceberg-sized chunks of ice into the Atlantic. The chunks float away, eventually melting.   But a new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that the largest sustained ice loss from early  to mid- came from the countrys south-west region, which is mostly devoid of large glaciers. Study lead author Professor Michael Bevis, of The Ohio State University in the States, said: Whatever this was, it couldnt be explained by glaciers, because there arent many there. It had to be the surface mass - the ice was melting inland from the coastline. The melting, which Professor Bevis and his colleagues believe is largely caused by global warming, meaning growing rivers of water are streaming into the ocean during summer.   The key finding from their study is that parts Greenland, which previously had not been considered a serious threat, will likely become a major future contributor to sea level rise. Professor Bevis said: We knew we had one big problem with increasing rates of ice discharge by some large outlet glaciers. But now we recognise a second serious problem: increasingly, large amounts of ice mass are going to leave as meltwater, as rivers that flow into the sea. He said the findings could have serious implications for coastal US cities, including New York and Miami, as well as island nations that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels. And he warned there is no turning back.   The only thing we can do is adapt and mitigate further global warming - its too late for there to be no effect, he added. This is going to cause additional sea level rise. We are watching the ice sheet hit a tipping point. Climate scientists and glaciologists have been monitoring the Greenland ice sheet as a whole since  when NASA and Germany joined forces to launch the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, known as GRACE. It involves twin satellites that measure ice loss across Greenland. Data from the satellites showed that between  and , Greenland lost around  gigatons of ice per year, equivalent to an annual sea level rise of . inches.   But the rate of ice loss across the island was far from steady. Professor Bevis team used data from GRACE and from GPS stations scattered around Greenlands coast to identy changes in ice mass. The patterns they found show an alarming trend - by , ice was being lost at nearly four times the rate that prevailed in . And the biggest surprise was that the acceleration was focused in south-west Greenland, a part of the island that previously hadnt been known to be losing ice that rapidly. The scholar’s findings are at complete odd to Trump’s views.   Only on Sunday, the US leader mocked the issue of climate change as eastern America was hit by temperatures as low as -C. He tweeted: “Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record-setting cold. “Amazing how big this system is. Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!” Trump was trolled on social media for his lack of understanding of climate change confusing it with simply cold weather.

The -year-old, who has vast experience in archaeology, added: I hope to find the tomb of Antony and Cleopatra soon. I do believe that they are buried in the same tomb.

He was assigned Romes eastern provinces, including theclient kingdom of Egypt, then ruled byCleopatra. It comes days after an ancient royal hall dating back to the era of Ramses II was previously discovered near to the identied Cleopatra site. It was unearthed below soft-brick buildings and commercial residential areas. The hall was used to hold royal celebrations such as the Jubilee feast.

The best friends reportedly wanted to surprise their mums by going home before their scheduled collection time in Yakutia, Siberia, the world’s coldest inhabited region. But they were not prepared for the bone-chilling cold on their -minute walk. CCTV caught the moment they fled nursery into the treacherous conditions, unseen by teachers. They put on their coats and hats but neither of the girls was wearing gloves - even though one of them had mittens in her pockets. Now the pair are recovering from frostbite and hypothermia after being out in a temperature C colder than ever recorded in Britain.   One of the children, named as Lena, remains in hospital as doctors battle to save her three frostbitten fingers. She had ended up forcing her way into a house and begging for help, after her unnamed friend got lost in the remote Namtsy village. Her friend was found one hour later, reported The Siberian Times.   Lenas mother said: “Three of her fingers froze hard. “She is crying. The children are still in shock.” The mother arrived early at pm to pick up Lena and found her coat missing. “We all started to panic,” she said. Then our grandfather called and said that Lena had just come home alone, all in tears, frozen.”The mother explained: “The girls decided to give their parents a surprise and come home by themselves.”  They certainly gave them a surprise - but there is now relief that the children are safe. Lenas mum added: Lena had mittens in her pocket - but she did not wear them.” An investigation is underway into how the girls managed to leave the nursery without anyone noticing. There is also concern that passersby did not stop the girls, although one helped one of the girls tie her scarf.

The busy Boeing  left Newark, New Jersey on Saturday afternoon for an ,-mile journey to Hong Kong. But it had to make an emergency landing around three-and-a-half hours into the flight after a passenger fell ill. He was taken off the jet at Goose Bay Airport, a remote military airbase in Newfoundland, Canada, but a mechanical fault meant the plane was unable to take off. It is believed the door had become frozen in the bitter -C conditions as snow fell on the tip of Canada. Some  passengers had to wait for nearly  hours as customs officers were not available overnight.   Temperatures on the plane quickly plummeted to uncomfortable levels, said passenger Sonjay Dutt, a professional wrestleren route to Hong Kong for a show. Crew handed out blankets but the tourists soon became angry, witnesses reported. I think people are so fed up,and so at their wits end, that even the sight of food didnt get everyone up and cheering, Mr Dutt told CBC.   Its been a long, long, long, long day, he later tweeted. United Airlines has since apologised for the delay. But when a relief aircraft finally arrived, passengers had to reach it at another part of the hub by bus.  The new plane had toto Newark - at pm on Sunday. Another angry passenger tweeted: Now we get off the plane and switch to the rescue plane toto Newark.It takes too long to fix the door in this plane.Much of eastern Canada, as well as the US northeast, has been suffering through a glacial cold spell, with heavy snowfalls that have led to scores of flight cancellations. A spokesman for United Airlines apologised, said the flight was originally erted to due to a medical emergency, where medical personnel met the plane and brought the passenger to hospital, but that a mechanical issue prevented it from taking off again.

Speaking at a press conference, the woman - surnamed Kuo - said: I told him we couldnt help him, but he started yelling. He told me to go in there immediately and threatened to relieve himself on the floor. As the passengers genitals were now exposed, one of my colleagues brought a blanket, which I used to cover his modesty. But he very angrily slapped my hand away, saying he didnt want it and only wanted me to remove his underwear so he could use the toilet.   The incident took place during on an Eva Air flight from Los Angeles, Calornia, to Taiwans Taoyuan airport on January . Kuo said she had to help the passenger, whom she estimates weighed .stone, to wipe his bottom. He allegedly then began moaning in pleasure as the chief attendant obeyed while wearing three pairs of latex gloves. Kuo, who was holding onto the passenger to keep in steady, recalled: He said: Oh, mmm, deeper, deeper, and then accused my chief attendant of not properly cleaning his backside, requesting that she do it again.   The passenger allegedly soon said: You can pull my pants back up now. He boarded the plane on a wheelchair and requested he be given three adjoining seats in economy class due to his size. As the flight was not full, he was granted his request, which later allegedly escalated to a demand to use the planes business class lavatory because he would not fit in the economy cubical.   EVA Air, which only employees female cabin crew, has said in a statement its staff are not obliged to accept demands from passengers - even those requiring special assistance.

The union has suggested two solutions: ban the passenger and others like him, and begin hiring male cabin staff.

The hardcore athletes are part of a special group of globe-trotting athletes who road-test the world’s toughest adventure races before they’re launched to the general public. In his day job Darren Grigas, , is a property investor from Peterborough while Allie Bailey is a -year-old freelance project manager from north London. But in their spare time they are hardcore race explorers. In the space of just three weeks late last year they completed a series of back-to-back ultra-marathons in locations that would put Bear Grylls to shame - while also bagging two world firsts in the process.  Their incredible excursions saw them making the first ever foot crossing of an uninhabited stretch of the Namib Desert, covering  miles in four days and ascending half the height of Everest. Just days later, they made they weer the first runners to take on the Panama Canal, trekking  miles in just a day and narrowly avoiding  ft long man-eating crocodiles. And they also found time to complete a ‘three peaks’ mountain challenge in South Africa while also spending a week dodging deadly snakes and spiders in the jungles of Central America. Darren and Allie are official ‘test pilots’ for UK firm Rat Race Adventure Sports.  Having pioneered these new routes, the races can now be launched as official events for paying punters. Darren - a dad-of-two who covered more than  miles on foot and ascended , ft in height in just  days - said: “Each of these inidual events are pretty epic on their own. “But doing them all back-to-back is something . “Typically, you’ll do one of these challenges, go home, and sleep for a week and eat as much as you can while feeling knackered.  “Instead we got on a  hour flight and did the same thing in a dferent location! “Being a Rat Race test pilot requires a certain amount of stamina, and it’s not for the faint hearted. But to go out to these locations and be the first to complete these routes is very, very special.” Allie took up running just a few years ago as a way to improve her mental health. Last year she became the first woman to run across the -mile long Khoumlvsgoumll Nuur frozen lake in Mongolia - braving temperatures as low as minus - ordmc - as part of her job as a Rat Race ambassador.  She said: “Completing these routes in Namibia, Panama and Mongolia really pushed us to the limits. “The jungles of Panama in particular were a real test of endurance for me. “But it’s part and parcel of being an adventure race test pilot. We’ve got to make sure these events are ‘doable’ before the general public is let loose on them. “And that often means running the gauntlet of dangerous animals, unassailable pathways and heat exhaustion.” On November , Darren and Allie - as well as Rat Race founder Jim Mee - set-off on a new -mile long journey into Namibia’s inhospitable Namib desert.  After four-and-a-half days negotiating ordmC heat and the world’s biggest sand dunes they racked-up , ft of ascent before arriving on the famous Skeleton Coast. This route will now become ‘Race to the Wreck’, with the first event taking place in November this year. Darren said: “The easiest way to describe what it’s like to climb these enormous sand dunes is to imagine going up an escalator the wrong way, in a heatwave, with tired legs.” Allie adds: “On the first day we set out at .am and it was already  degrees. Upon packing up camp we found two yellow scorpions had crawled under our groundsheets. We’d lucked out - they are very, very poisonous!”  On November  the team arrived in Cape Town to complete a ‘three peaks’ challenge, covering  miles and ,ft of ascent as Darren and Allie scaled Table Mountain, Signal Hill and Lions Head. Darren added: “It was a light run compared with what we’d just done in Namibia.” International flights then took Darren and the team to Panama, where on November th they embarked on a one day, full traverse of the famous Panama Canal on foot and via kayak - the first time such a trip has ever been done. It was on this -mile day-long journey they encountered massive crocodiles in the warm waters.  Darren said: “The most worrying part was seeing a ft long croc at the precise location where we had to get out of the kayaks and wade through shallow water to the start of the jungle. “I heard a snap - and it was a big one. We were in their prime hunting spot. The vegetation was just as nasty, too, covered in needles three inches long.” Just two days later the Rat Race test pilots then embarked on a km coast-to-coast crossing of western Panama, travelling from the Pacic shores in the south to the Caribbean in the north. They passed through pristine rainforest, which is home to jaguar, puma and howler monkey.  This mission was a real test for the group as they ascended , ft over six days and made their way over a dormant volcano. Darren was bitten by a mysterious spider and made what he called a “schoolboy error” of standing barefoot on his machete, running his heel down the blade on the very first day, suffering a deep wound to his foot which caused him pain from that moment on. They also had to dodge deadly snakes, including the fearsome The Fer-De-Lance, as well as coral snakes and tree vipers. Allie said: “All that separated us from the wildle was a thin net. One night it rained so hard my hammock slipped and I woke up on the floor, but I was just too exhausted to get up and re-erect it. I made a few new bug friends on the jungle floor that night” Darren added: “I’d never gone from event to event to event like this before, and I was really feeling it. We all were. “And we were out in the jungle on our own, where the only help we had was each other.” One member of the team suffered such extreme heat exhaustion as they neared the finish line he collapsed, just  metres from the exit point, sparking a medical emergency. Rat Race leader Jim, who was joined by partner Danielle Brodie in Namibia, said: “We’d ascended and descended the height of Everest, in extreme heat and really tricky conditions, while carrying heavy packs.  “One of the guys battled through everything that the jungle threw at him but simply collapsed on the last day. His body shut down, he couldn’t see properly and he lost the feeling in his legs. “We laid him down in a river and got him cooled down. It was pretty serious for a while, but we all work together to ensure the team can respond when someone needs help. “This whole trip was the toughest thing any of us had done.” If that sounds like enough adventure to last a letime, the Rat Race test pilots will soon be making their way to other far-flung locations to pioneer new ‘Bucket List’ events.

All you are really thinking about day-to-day is the next game and getting three points.“Maybe afterwards there will be people talking about it and you are pleased you’ve got a win for him because it is the first time he’s been here.“Before a game, though, it’s not something we’re thinking about.”And,Nesbitt and his team-mates would have liked to have played better in front of the man who pays their wages, he believes the owner could take encouragement from the way United battled for three big points.In danger of being detached at the turn of the year, back-to-back defeats for Ross County and Ayr have left United just one win off the pace in the battle for automatic promotion.And,the former Celtic kid would have liked to have put on a better show for everyone who was at Tannadice, he knows getting the job done mattered most.“Three points and the results where went our way, that makes it a good day.“It was, obviously, a bit of a battle but we got there in the end and that’s what matters.Performance-wise it wasn’t the best and we would expect to play a lot better than that and put on a show but sometimes circumstances in a game mean it doesn’t go that way and then you need to grind it out and win it.”If Nesbitt was nothing like satisfied with his own display, he had the consolation of knowing for the second week running he played a part in a vital goal.His debut against Partick saw him win the penalty to earn United a point and on Saturday he provided the cross for Nicky Clark’s dramatic late winner.“It’s good to contribute when you’re new and I’ve done that in my first two games.“My game play against Dunfermline wasn’t good enough but to make contributions is important andI’m still making those contributions when I’m playing better I will be happy.”In setting up the all-important goal, Nesbitt showed character. He had not been happy with his performance but he wasn’t going to hide.“I had a pass that went nowhere and, before the goal, a cross that went right to their keeper.“When that happens you can put your head down and go into a shell, especially in a game like that one but you just need to keep going, believe in yourself.“I kept going and when I saw Cammy I cut it back to him. It came back out to me and I saw a couple of boys running. Nicky made a brilliant run and when I saw him I just put it in that area and let him meet it. He’s done that and finished brilliantly. It was scrappy but one good ball and one good header and it’s a good day.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c41d925525d28.88073341.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds sam stanton does not want to experience another scottish cup shock","story":"Sam Stanton has been on both ends of cup shocks in his time, and it’s the feeling when he was on the wrong end of one that makes him determined to make sure Dundee United win their fourth-round tie against Montrose.As a Hibs player, Stanton was part of the side that made an unexpected exit at the hands of Raith Rovers.That painful memory is one he does not want to experience again.“I’ve actually had good and bad in the cup and, hopefully, this can be another good memory,” said the midfielder.“When I was at Dumbarton, we had a couple of games where we weren’t expected to win and did, so that was a nice feeling.“But, when I was at Hibs, we were beaten by Raith and that definitely wasn’t a nice experience.“They were in the Championship and we were in the Premier League, so everyone expected us to get through. It wasn’t good when we lost.“That feeling is one you don’t want again and results like that one just show you can’t take anything for granted.“Teams in Scotland in all the leagues have good players and,you don’t have the proper approach, you will have problems.”And Stanton expects Montrose to battle tooth and nail to cause a shock tomorrow but believes United will be ready to cope with that.“These are dficult games because you know one team is giving everything they can to beat you because they have that nothing-to-lose mentality about them.“I’ve been there myself in those cup-ties when I was with Dumbarton, where you play teams who are bigger than your club and you don’t normally play against.“It excites you and it’s a chance for you to show how good you are. It’s why,you’re the bigger team, you can never take these games for granted.”He believes the key to avoiding a shock is treating the opposition with the respect they deserve and working towards the tie asit was a big game.“We have prepared for this one like we do every other game and that makes sure you have the right attitude.“The manager has had his videos of Montrose and been telling us about their strengths and weaknesses.“That way you make sure you are going into the game with the right mentality.”And,promotion from the Championship this term is by far the No  goal, Stanton admits he would love to go as far as possible in the cup.“A cup run is always important for the supporters and we know that.“For the players as well, it’s nice to do well and, as a football club, it is always important that we go as far as we can in the cup.“It’s another game we want to win and,you can string some wins together in the league and add a cup run to that as well, it’s always a help.”Stanton is also well aware that a side story tomorrow will be Tangerines legend Sean Dillon coming up against them for the first time since he ended a -year stay at Tannadice in .He expects the man who won the cup with United in  to get a rousing welcome from Arabs but, once that is out of the way and the game kicks off, it will be business as usual.“Sean left before I arrived at United but I know what a good player he was for the club.“He was here a long time and I’m sure he will get a good reception from our fans who travel up there.“For us, it’s about making sure he’s not the one getting clapped off the pitch after the game has finished.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c4079a3cf34a9.68815705.jpg ","title":"dundee winger andy dales looking to make instant impact","story":"Dundee winger Andy Dales is hoping to hit the ground running after checking in at Dens Park on loan from Scunthorpe United.The -year-old former Derby County youth academy product has joined up with the Dark Blues until the end of the season and goes straight into the squad for Saturday’s Scottish Cup fourth-round visit of Queen of the South.It was a deal that was agreed quickly, so much so, the England C international had to race north on Monday morning to complete the move.He has been in training with Jim McIntyre’s men since and is hoping to make his debut at Dens this weekend.“It’s been really good, I had a little chat with the gaffer on Tuesday morning and have had some intense training sessions so I’m really looking forward to it,” said Dales.“I only found out on Monday morning.

a good job for the team.Signed from Cowdenbeath in , Rolland, nicknamed “The Galloping Major”, would stay for  years at Tannadice.United wanted him to stay on but the player had an offer from American club Fort Lauderdale Strikers.Given his tremendous service in playing well over  games for the Terrors, the club immediately granted him a free transfer in September .He said at the time: “This offer has come right out of the blue.“Fort Lauderdale phoned me on Thursday, wanted me to travel on Saturday, and then play my first game for them on Sunday.“But that was too rushed for me.“I expect to go sometime next week.”He continued: “It’s a great offer, and I had to accept.“However, it’s a wrench leaving United after all these years.“Fort Lauderdale have offered me a -month all-year contract, but I’d rather come home when the main season finishes.”Tannadice manager Jim McLean was sorry to see his full-back go.“We will miss him – off the field as well as on it,” he said.“Since I’ve come into Tannadice, we have now lost three great long-serving players – Dennis Gillespie and Doug Smith being the others.“All of them were outstanding club men, and great examples for our young players.”The

I’ve enjoyed it, the lads, the training, everything about it has been good,” said the man who is teaming up again with boss Jim McIntyre after their time together at Ross County.“The fitness levels are really good and the lads are at it. You can see they are up for the fight and there is some really good quality here, there’s no doubt about that, so it’s looking promising.”And the Liverpudlian believes three weeks off has given Dundee the chance to recharge their batteries.“I think the break has been a good thing, mentally in particular. I’ve been in this position and sometimes when you are in that rut when you are finding it dficult to pick up points it’s nice to have that break.“Mentally and physically you get away from it and then you come back in like it’s almost a new season, so I think it has been welcome.“And the mood here has been good but I don’t think I’ve been surprised by that because the lads know there is enough here and we are adding a few more bodies, so we know we have what’s needed.“We are up for a fight and you can see that looking round.”Curran believes that willingness, starting with tomorrow’s cup-tie, to do whatever it takes to get wins will be vital in the coming weeks.“There are times when it’s not going to be pretty because of where we’re at. There is going to be that sense of anxiousness going into games but we have that hunger and drive to overcome that.“There might be games that are ugly but these are ones we need to make sure we go on and win.“Whether we scrap it out - or -, we have to win and, once we do, we can then go and play a bit like I know we are capable of.”If, on paper, Dundee have been handed the perfect opportunity to report back with a win by being paired with a side from the second tier, Curran knows they’ll have to perform to make the next round.His time at Tannadice taught him there are decent outfits in that ision and, after facing them twice, he puts Queens in that category.“This is not going to be an easy game, just because they are in the Championship, no one can think that.“They have boys who are good players – Stephen Dobbie is on fire right now with his goals.“So, the mentality is the one thing we have to make sure is right and that’s not something I think we have an issue with. We have to make sure we come out on top, that’s our aim.”Curran also took the opportunity to stress he left United on good terms and thanked Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson for allowing him to move early in the January window.“I had a good relationship with Robbie and I only have good things to say about him.“The style he wanted was to play with one striker and Pavol Safranko has been the best player at United by a margin, I feel.“I understood that and he understood what an opportunity this move was for me.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c051af07378a-e1543840266799-940x555.jpg ","title":"tom duthie scottish football should never allow merger of dundees clubs","story":"The latest outbreak of merger fever in Dundee was no more than another in a long list of  alarms among the city’s football public.It’s not unlike the hypochondriac who catches a cold and immediately thinks he’s gone down with pneumonia.The revelation Dundee owner Tim Keyes wants to increase his shareholding to over % and remove the right of the club’s supporters’ society to veto any merger with neighbours United, had temperatures running high.With another American, Mark Ogren, now in control at Tannadice, fans of both clubs had been examining the “symptoms” and reached the diagnosis that a coming together was desired.That shows the accusation the media never let the facts get in the way of a good story can also, sometimes, be levelled at supporters.All along a forensic examination of the timeline of those symptoms strongly suggested this had everything to do with Keyes wanting to be able to build his new stadium at Camperdown without having to get the go-ahead from the fans’ group.Moving away from Dens is another on the list of protected items they can block and,Keyes is going to spend millions on “Nou Campie”, it’s not stretching the imagination to see why he might not want to need permission from a group that won’t be asked to inject a penny.More signicant is the fact Dundee first raised the matter months ago – before Ogren was on the scene at United. Even though this was a case of putting two and two together and getting five, it shows, despite merger being mooted and quickly dismissed on numerous occasions down the decades, it remains a worrying subject for the fans.And while those further afield may see a lot of sense in a one-club city, for those punters who actually turn up at Dens and Tannadice, it is the nightmare scenario. They’ll take hard times like financial crisis and relegation and stick with their team but what they’d never do is watch a merged team.That alone is why such a move is too dangerous. The clubs should always take the “nos” of the fans who go to games over the “I woulds” of potential new customers of a ‘Dundee City’.There is every chance a build-it-and-they-will-come merger would leave us with a club only slightly bigger than the two that exist.That wouldn’t just be bad for the city but Scottish football and it makes it surprising that, when the topic is raised, no one at the top of the game has come out against it.While sporting performance is rightly the normal criteria for the make-up of our top ision,ever it was to be done on size of club, Dundee and United would be in there – and comfortably so.If Premiership membership was decided on that second basis the top  would be something like Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen, Hearts, Hibs, Dundee United, Dundee, Motherwell, Kilmarnock, St Johnstone, Falkirk and St Mirren.The likes of Morton, Dunfermline and Inverness may argue they should be in there but it would be on the basis they have more potential than the names at the end of that list.When it comes to core support, the first seven clubs listed are untouchable. If Glasgow giants Rangers or Celtic, on their own, are bigger than the rest put together, those from the country’s three other major cities are also well ahead of the others below them.To reiterate, in all but exceptional circumstances, results should determine who’s in the top league, so it’s up to the likes of United to get back there by winning matches.But when the Tangerines and the Dark Blues are in the top flight, Scottish football is the better for it.That will always be the case."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"university-celebrates-life-of-engineer-james-watt","story":"The pioneering work of James Watt will be celebrated by the University of Glasgow with a year of events marking  years since the engineerrsquos death."},{"url":null,"title":"planning-application-for-new-drive-thru-starbucks-in-denniestoun","story":"A planning application to transform land nexta Dennistoungarage into a drive-thruStarbucks is awaiting council approval."},{"url":null,"title":"more-plunging-temperatures-and-winter-weather-on-the-way","story":"Disruptive snow and plunging temperatures could be set tohitGlasgow next week."},{"url":null,"title":"owen-hassan-memory-page-set-up-for-tragic-dad-of-three","story":"Friends of tragic dad-of-three Owen Hassan who diedafter being attackedlast year have set up a memory page for him."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-2-airdrie-0-celtic-3-airdrie-0-scott-sinclair-and-timo-weah-send-celtic-through-scottish-cup-tie","story":"A double from Scott Sinclair and a debut strike from Timo Weah - who even got a flash of the disco lights for his troubles - eased Celtic into the fth round of the William Hill Scottish Cup.

You cannot preserve something which is no longer viable.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It#s no longer viable, yet without grazing by farm animals the bioersity changes.

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13865741.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_JS172700549.jpg","title":"brexit conservative remainer mp admits","story":"NewsBrexit: Conservative Remainer MP admits he would consider voting Leave in second referendumBill Grant says \"arrogance\" from EU negotiators may push him towards voting Leaveany second referendum arose.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsBill Grant MP \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Scots Tory MP says he would consider performing a Brexit u-turnBritain goes back to the polls.

Tory group leader Martin Dowey made the plea for the area to be more car-friendly following the announcement of the closure of Hourstons last week. Councillor Dowey urged the council to ease parking charges in the High Street in a bid to encourage more footfall to the area. Speaking at Seafield, Fort and Wallacetown Community Council last Wednesday, he said: “I am frustrated and saddened at Hourstons closing. “Given the retail climate, it wasn’t unexpected.” The councillor said internet and retail park shopping had contributed to the demise of town centres across the country. “Town centre shops need to be smaller and more niche,” he added. “The town centre is far too big for the size of Ayr.   “We need to utilise what we have got to encourage footfall.” SNP ward councillor Siobhian Brown is disappointed that the iconic store is to close and said a long-term plan is needed to attract more people back to the town centre. “It is a sign of times as people buy online,” she added. Norman McLean, the community council’s chairman, said: “It didn’t get the footfall. It was only a couple of months ago I was in the store and I felt like I was the only person there. “Has the council got any contingency plans  “What about waiving the cost of the first hour parking at parking meters ” The meeting heard that Hourstons were paying pound, per year in business rates before they started paying staff and other costs. Now the iconic building could be turned into flats or used by the council for offices.   Councillor Dowey added: “We need more parking and we have to bring cars back into the High Street. “The one-way system brought in the s was probably a good idea then but it is not such a good idea now. “People don’t drive down the High Street as much any more and they don’t see how bad the bottom end is. “I am guilty as anyone because I go to Heathfield for shopping because you can get parking there.” One community councillor said more must be done to attract sport and culture to the town centre to get people back there. “Retail cannot be sustained,” he insisted. “We need cultural tourism to do draw people into the town centre.” Another pointed out that shops in Prestwick and Troon are thriving: “The dference between Prestwick and Ayr is that they have all small units and in Ayr it is all big High Street units for the past  or  years. Big units cost too much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"one-in-five-dont-have-superfast-broadband-in-borders","story":"ALMOST one in five homes in the Borders donrsquot have access to superfast broadband, a report has found.Figures by communications regulator Ofcom reveal just  per cent of properties in the region can obtain internet speeds of over  megabits a second.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

This apple is magic and is found at the top of a tall ancient tree, which grows deep in a dark forest.ldquoTo get to the tree first you must find your way through the forest. Then you will come to a circular clearing, where there are no trees except the ancient tall apple tree.ldquoThis tree grows in the middle of the clearing and its single fruit, the apple of your dreams, can be seen on its topmost branch.The storyteller looked round his audience.ldquoWill you try to reach it and pick it to make your dream come true  he asked.The children all answered yes.ldquoThen first you must decide what your dreams are.ldquoBe rich, was a common response. The storyteller smiled and nodded: ldquoYes we all have dreams of being rich, but rich in what  Rich in love and happiness, or rich in money and things ldquoItrsquos the same, said one child. ldquoI donrsquot think it is, said another, looking at the storyteller. ldquoIs it ldquoThat is a good question, replied the storyteller, ldquofor sure having too little money is not a good thing. And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story. You may tell it slightly dferently each time, but thatrsquos fine. Your child may remind you of how it was told before, as he or she will have their own visualisation of the tale.Or your child may ask you for a dferent story, in which case you are back at the base of another story mountain ready to climb it!Happy storytelling!"},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-250-more-homes-in-dunbar-to-be-revealed","story":"Members of the public have the chance to view the

of what they put in.Mrs Bell was keen for social housing and bungalows to be included within the development.She noted concerns had also been expressed about how the townrsquos infrastructure, such as medical centre and primary school, would cope with further expansion, as well as fears it would lead to wildle, such as deer, being displaced and even killed on neighbouring roads.More detailed plans for the site are expected to be revealed at the consultation event.Ward councillor Norman Hampshire said ldquoone or two issues still needed to be dealt with, including the potential road layout, as

Challenging pupil behaviour, frequent changes to curriculum and assessment have contributed to stress and workload. Smaller budgets mean doing more with less.The perception that teachers are overworked and underpaid has impacted on recruitment. Nearly all councils have multiple vacancies. Head teacher posts that once would have attracted double digit applications have become hard to fill.Unsurprisingly, teachers have become restless and vocal as they see their salaries fall in real terms. Large demonstrations and near-unanimous rejection of a % increase by Educational Institute of Scotlandmembers were clear signs of the way the wind was blowing. The decision by the EIS Council to ballot members on strike action comes as no surprise.Teachers have a case for a rise but, then again, so have many other public sector workers. Threatening strike action can be a useful bargaining strategy, but teachers and their leaders need to ponder further on its effectiveness and consequences.To paraphrase LP Hartley, the past was a dferent country and indeed, we did do things dferently there. The present social, political and economic climate is very dferent to that of the s and s. Take, for example the number of days lost to strikes. From the early s until the mid-s around  million working days were lost each year. In  the number was ,.That is largely due to the decline in union membership and influence. Additionally, unions have recognised that strike action is rarely effective. Teaching unions have generally bucked the trend and teachers continue to form a largely unionised profession. The relative strength and solidarity of the teaching unions may well be fuelling their apparent readiness to act. Nevertheless, like Marty McFly, teachers are in real danger of being transported back to the future.Very few of those to be balloted would have been involved in the prolonged industrial action of the s and s. That lack of personal experience may well contribute to strong support for strike action. Those of us, however, who lived and worked through those years remember what it was like and the lasting damage it did to the profession and, more importantly, to the youngsters who were in our care.Back then, teachers generally managed to keep parents on side. The strikes and school closures were only part of widespread action by many groups including miners, dockers, transport workers and large swathes of the public sector. It is questionable , in the current climate of austerity and post-Brexit uncertainty, parents will be as supportive. Many of them have suffered reductions in their own spending power and standard of living. They are unlikely to view teachers as a special case especiallyincurring additional expense for child care.Teachers might also wish to consider the moral imperative. Presumably we all entered the profession because of our passionate belief in the le changing potential of education. If so, can reducing young peoplersquos le chances be justied  Surely, very few teachers would argue that these youngsters are mere collateral damage. It was particularly dispiriting to hear one union leader threaten sustained strike action in Government ministersrsquo constituencies. To target particular children because of where they live would be despicable and unacceptable.During the disputes of the s I continued to run a school football team. I recall being berated by a delegation of colleagues, one of whom asked, ldquoWhose side are you on  Up until that time I had never considered that there were sides in education. I naiumlvely believed we were all on the youngstersrsquo side.Hopefully, unions and the Government will recognise that they are both on the youngstersrsquo side. Teachers deserve a rise but it mustnrsquot be our young people who foot the bill. A decent increase spread over two years may be a way out. Sure, it will cost, but not as much as sacricing another generation of young people and their prospects."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  MPs must work together to unblock Brexit  or they   ll open the way for authoritarians","story":"So, we at least have breathing space, a pause, a moment for reflection. My own wish would be for MPs to seize the moment and vote to revoke Article  altogether. MPs have the power to stop the clock for good, thanks to the good works of legally-minded MPs like the SNPrsquos Joanna Cherry.Staying in the EU is the only sure way to stop the endless arguments about Canada plus, Norway plus, customs union, Irish backstop, regulatory alignment, maximum facilitation and all the rest of the gubbins thatrsquos been occupying our addled brains for the last two-and-a-half years. However, this isnrsquot going to happen.And Irsquod have to agree that it would be undemocratic for MPs to simply reverse the result of the  referendum by revoking A. It may be that Parliament has the power and the constitutional right to do so: referendums are only advisory. But it would leave so much unpleasantness that British politics would be soured for decades. There would have to be a referendum.This is where my unease turns to genuine anxiety. I have a horrible feeling that Labourrsquos Diane Abbott was right on Question Time this week when she said: ldquoBe careful what you wish for. She agrees with Nigel Farage that a repeat referendum is likely to endorse no-deal Brexit, perhaps by an even greater margin than in .Evenit left us with a mirror-image result, with say % Remain against % Leave, that would itself be a disaster because it would have no legitimacy. Yes, some opinion polls say Remain would win a comfortable majority, but they said that last time.The Brexiteers are already field-testing their slogans on social media. The frontrunner is ldquoTell Them Again, which may not be as resonant as ldquoTake Back Control but is still pretty hot. It surfs on the very widespread disgust and alienation that many ordinary people feel about the political elite. It appeals to democratic injustice: how dare the globalists ignore the result of , which David Cameron promised would be for keeps What would Remainrsquos slogan be  Itrsquos likely to be a repeat of the Project Fear line which failed dismally in . ldquoDonrsquot put your childrenrsquos prosperity at risk, perhaps, or ldquoThink Twice Think Jobs. But what many pro-Europeans fail to grasp ndash and this applied to the Unionists in the Scottish independence referendum ndash is that it ISNrsquoT the economy, stupid. Brexit voters donrsquot just make their decisions on the basis of economic rationality, as seen from the CBI and corporate Britain.People are always motivated more by emotion than numbers ndash on what they believe to be morally right. The sense that working-class people have lost control is a very potent mobiliser.As in war ndash and it is remarkable how much Brexit mythology harks back to World War Two ndash people are quite willing to sacrice some comfort for what they believe in.I may think they are mistaken. As with the people who supported Donald Trump because he promised to Make America Great Again, and bring back the jobs, I think Brexit voters have been sold a  prospectus by politicians who do not have the best interests of working people at their hearts.But that isnrsquot really the point. I can well understand the sense of injustice felt by people who have been left behind by global capitalism. They want to kick the system, and the referendum gave them a chance to do it. They need a very strong reason not to kick the metropolitans again. Only Labour can provide that reason, and Jeremy Corbyn has been singularly reluctant to do so.His refusal even to meet Theresa May was irresponsible in this climate. It may have allowed him to avoid coming off the fence, but it looked petty and weak. Corbyn should have gone in guns blazing, demanded that she drop the red lines, and then mobilised Labour for either rejoining the single market or for a referendum.Single market membership has always been the logic of Labourrsquos position, even though Corbyn usually refers to a ldquopermanent customs union. Only by joining the European Economic Area could Labour deliver friction-free trade, and protect environmental standards and workers rights. People say that Norway has blocked the UKrsquos entry to the European Economic Area, but this is not true. The Norwegian PM, Erna Solberg, has repeatedly made clear that Norway would have severe reservations ndashwho wouldnrsquot  ndash but would not block UK membership.This is because the EEA is essentially a Brussels creation. It was set up as a halfway house to membership of the EU back in  when a number of countries were uneasy about joining the political institutions of Europe. The EEA is just the European Single Market under another name.Brussels endorses British membership of the EEA, and this economic arrangement has a number of advantages over Mayrsquos deal. Therersquos no need for an Irish backstop no membership of the CAP and the Common Fisheries Policy no direct jurisdiction of the European Court and it costs less than EU membership. Of course, it does not bring the full benefits of EU membership. Britain would become a ldquorule taker on trade. But the EEA does not preclude future membership of the European Union. Norway, or any other member of the EEA, can opt for full membership at any time. And unlike the backstop, countries can leave the EEA after one year.Membership of the single market also means accepting freedom of movement, which is why it may well be rejected by Parliament. But it is the only option that has a snowballrsquos chance of getting a majority,Labour were to seriously support it. ldquoNorway plus, as itrsquos called, has more support than a repeat referendum. Fewer than  Labour MPs have called for a Peoples Vote, and only  Conservatives. The SNP has decided to throw its lot in with a repeat referendum, despite having argued convincingly for the single market for the last two years. But that isnrsquot enough.To repeat. Were it left to me, I would revoke Article  tomorrow. I just want this madness to stop. But given the metrics in Parliament, we have to look at the least worst options, as the Labour-supporting commentator Owen Jones put it last week. Mayrsquos deal is dead. MPs owe it to the country, and to themselves, to find some compromise that works. Perhaps that can only be achieved with a referendum. ButMPs fail this week, they risk destroying respect for parliamentary democracy, and opening the way for a more authoritarian form of political leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-piles-pressure-on-nicola-sturgeon-over-indyref2","story":"Mr Salmond said the Westminster crisis over Brexit meant there was ldquonot likely to be a better time to force the issue.He told the Sunday National: ldquoNicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda when we will never have better circumstances.ldquoAs far as I am concerned Westminsterrsquos Brexit dficulty should be Scotlandrsquos opportunity.ldquoRight now, the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart.ldquoThere is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.The Scottish Tories said the war between the Yes movements two biggest beasts was getting worse by the day, and urged Ms Sturgeon \"to put Alex Salmond back in his box\".Mr Salmondrsquos comments come amid open ision in the Yes movement over the timing of Indyref.Ms Sturgeon has said she will give an update on timing in ldquoa matter of weeks, but appears to be playing a long game, focusing for now on a Peoplersquos Vote over Brexit.However an increasingly strident Mr Salmond - buoyed by his legal win against the Scottish Government over its botched misconduct probe into him - is pushing for immediate action.The split between the past and present first ministers has led to a bitter briefing war.Ms Sturgeonrsquos office has accused the ldquoother side of \"smears\" and waging a ldquovendetta\".Mr Salmond blamed the ldquounionist press for ldquoprovoking a response, but admitted he had told his own spinners and proxies to stop getting involved.He said: ldquoIt takes two to tango and Irsquom just not playing this game.

Skills Development Scotland, the Golden Jubilee Foundation, the Crown Office  Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish Government and the City of Glasgow College were ranked at numbers , , ,  and  respectively.However, Skills Development Scotland were given a special commendation for going above and beyond to make trans staff feel accepted.The survey comes as trans people continue to face worrying levels of abuse in both their private lives and in the public sphere. One in eight trans employeeshave been physically attacked by a colleague or customer in the last year.Moreover, research released by Stonewall last year that showed more than a third of LGBT staffhave hidden they are LGBT at work and almost one in five LGBT employeeshave been the target of negative comments from colleagues because of their identity.Darren Towers, Stonewallrsquos executive director, said:\"Scotland has made impressive strides when it comes to driving LGBT equality forward in society. Wersquore very proud of the employers featured in the Top . We know from our recent research that one in eight lesbian, gay and bi staff in Scotlandare not open with anyone at work about their sexual orientation, while nearly one in five trans employeesarenrsquot open about their gender identity for fear of discrimination. So, whilst employers based or working in Scotland have achieved much, therersquos more for us all to do. Every employer has the power and the opportunity to make changes to improve the situation for LGBT staff.\"John Wilkes, Equality and Human Rights Commission head of Scotland, said: \"Scotland takes pride from the fact we are a tolerant and inclusive country.

Here goes.The first one is this: the Salmond investigation is unlikely to change many minds on independence, which is where Walter Macfarlane comes in. Walter, I should explain, has been dead for  years but I only came across him for the first time a few days ago while I was reading the journals of the great Scottish diarist James Boswell. Boswell writes about meeting Macfarlane in the entry for Sunday  November  and describes him as a man who was ldquokeenly interested in the reigning contests between Scots  English.:Poll suggests SNPs credibility damaged by Alex Salmond allegationsldquoHe talked much against the Union, writes Boswell of his new friend. ldquoHe said we were perfect underlings, that our riches were carried out of the country, that no town but Glasgow had any advantage of trade by it, and that many others were hurt by it.Why am I bringing this up now  Mainly because it demonstrates something thatrsquos often forgotten, which is that unhappiness with the Union and support for independence is not a modern phenomenon, and itrsquos not all about the SNP either. As you can see from Boswellrsquos diary, Macfarlane was complaining about the Union just  years or so after the Act of Parliament that brought it about and  years before the SNP was even thought of. Which is the important point: independence has always been a strand of Scottish opinion and, seen in that long historical context, the travails of Nicola Sturgeonare unlikely to greatly change that one way or the other.The second fact is this: the Salmond investigation has emphasised that there are serious isions in the SNP. Some nationalists appear to be offended by this idea and deny there is any ision at all but the briefings of Salmond supporters against Sturgeon and vice versa speak for themselves. In fact, even as he made an apparent appeal to end the acrimony at the weekend, Alex Salmond couldnrsquot resist turning his handshake into a punch. He said he had ordered his team not to become involved in any more exchanges before criticising Sturgeon for not concentrating on independence. There may be some in the SNP who insist this doesnrsquot represent ision but then Baghdad Bob insisted there were no American troops in Iraq to the sound of American troops in Iraq.The third fact leads straight on from the ision in the SNP but is about nationalism more generally and itrsquos this: levels of support for both sides of the independence debate have not shted.In some ways, this third fact is the most surprising of all because, on the face of it, the circumstances are in place for a breakthrough on either side. For the opposition parties at Holyrood, therersquos the Salmond investigation and its implications for Sturgeon and yet support for the SNP has not changed, and for the nationalists, therersquos the crisis of Brexit and yet the polls continue to show  per cent of Scots want to remain in the UK. The nationalists may talk about a ldquosurge and the unionists may revel in the SNPrsquos crisis, but the polls havenrsquot changed. Thatrsquos a fact.Which leads us to the fourth, final, and perhaps most controversial fact: a second referendum on Scottish independence before  is less likely than it was two years ago. Partly, this is because of those polls againbut itrsquos also because of the logistics and timing. The reality now is that we may not know ndash even by  ndash what Brexit is going to look like and Sturgeon herself has said there will be no announcement until the fog has cleared. Then therersquos the clincher: there is no prospect of a Section  order giving permission for a referendum from the Conservative Government. Thatrsquos a fact many of those in the independence movement simply pretend does not exist.:Calls for public inquiry into \"unlawful\" handling of sexual misconduct complaints against Alex SalmondThe effect of all of these facts, as Irsquove confidently called them, is another matter entirely and depends on how much the politicians resist them. In the wake of the Salmond investigation, itrsquos certainly hard to imagine the SNP fighting the  election campaign with any of the confidence it had in  and , and even in , but then again therersquos every chance Nicola Sturgeon will stick to the grid and announce a referendum before  in the hope that its rejection by the UK Government will increase support for her position.Should that happen, I have honestly no ideathe strategy would work ndash the facts donrsquot stretch that far ndash but maybe now would be a good time toto the diaries of James Boswell for some insight from the past.Writing on  December , just a few days after his meeting with Walter Macfarlane, Boswell got to thinking about the upheavals caused by unrest and war. He did not much care for the quarrels of Mankind when ided into particular states and nations, he wrote, but he could see that they depended not on facts but on the frailties of humans. ldquoI can see that Great People, those who manage the fates of Kingdoms, he said, ldquoare just such beings as myself."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9312948.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-may-set-to-reveal-plan-to-ditch-irish-backstop-in-bid-to-win-over-brexit-deal-critics","story":"Last week, the Prime Minister said she would focus on cross-party talksto get a withdrawal agreement accepted by Parliament.But it is understood she is now seeking to win approval from her own benches and show the EU that MPs could back a deal without a backstop in the hope of encouraging Brussels to soften its position.The backstop is the \"insurance policy\" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU.Mrs Mays initial withdrawal deal was rejected by a majority of  MPs in a historic defeat earlier this month.If Parliament doesnt approve a withdrawal agreement, the UK is due to leave the EU on  March without a deal or transition period.The prime minister will address the Commons on Monday afternoon, setting out how she intends to proceed with the Brexit withdrawal agreement.She will also table a \"neutral\" motion, simply saying that the Commons has considered her statement, which will be debated and voted upon on January .This motion is expected to attract amendments from groups of backbenchers seeking more of a say in the process.Read more: Brexit - What might happen nextTwo groups of MPs are expected to table bills which could take a no-deal Brexit off the table, and potentially suspend Article  - which allows the UK to leave the EU.One of the groups -which includes Labours Yvette Cooper, Conservative Nicky Morgan, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb - wants the UK to extend negotiations with the EU beyond  March,MPs do not approve a withdrawal agreement by  February.There was anger among pro-Leave MPs at moves to enable backbenchers to take control of the Commons business from the Government - in breach of normal conventions - through a series of amendments to the neutral motion.One group including senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Nick Boles is seeking to give time for a bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February.Another more radical amendment drawn up by former attorney general Dominic Grieve would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs - from at least five parties and including  Tories - to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Read more:Ian Blackford urges PM to lsquofundamentallyrsquo change position on BrexitMr Grieve said it would enable the Commons to stage a series of \"indicative votes\" on the ious alternatives, such as a \"soft\" Norway-style deal or a second referendum to establish which could command a majority.He denied claims he was seeking to prevent Britain leaving the EU after International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to \"hijack\" the  referendum vote.Mrs May is expected to use her statement to explain how she intends to proceed in the run up to the vote on January , rather than setting out a detailed \"plan B\".But Ian Blackford blasted the reported plans, tweeting on Monday: \"The threat to reopen the Good Friday agreement is beneath contempt from a Prime Minister who I did not think could plumb such depths.

Schedulers do not have the gt of foresight, and perhaps it would not have worked to substitute another episode, but still.Christine , in for a gallbladder op, was the centre of attention last night. It is usually booze-guzzling Cathy, the Venus man trap in heels, who dominates proceedings but she left after the first scene. Although this deprived viewers of the pleasure of seeing Cathy and Michellesquare up to each other like a Caledonian Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, it gave the others a chance to shine.Christine had the pick of the lines. Politically incorrect as always, she could not praise the place or the staff highly enough before tearing them down again. ldquoEverythingrsquos disabled friendly in here. There are wee ramps everywhere. Theyrsquore a ******* nuisance.While some might have missed Cathyrsquos presence, Simon Carlyle and Gregor Sharprsquos sitcom works best as an ensemble effort, an Abigailrsquos Party blend of characters, high camp and low farce. This episode being set in a hospital, there was plenty of scope for riper material which Carlyle and Sharp could not resist. Sure enough, the revelation that Christine had an en suite bathroom duly led to Alantaking the worldrsquos loudest pee while everyone pretended not to hear Niagara Falls two feet away.Two Doors Down gets away with material like this, and the frequent swearing, because care is taken to even out the sweet and sour. When Alan comes out of the bathroom, for instance, his partner Michelle went into mummy to toddler mode, askinghe had washed his hands. ldquoBack in, she scolded. Everyone knows a couple like this.If that was not to your liking there was Christine in rare reflective mode , and Jonathan Watson, wonderful Watson, showing once again that Scottish comedy has only skimmed the surface of his talents. After his character Colin paid a heartfelt tribute to the NHS, Eric askedhe was still in Bupa. ldquoOh God aye, he replied.The finest five minutes came in a group rf about hospital woes they had known, with Michelle remembering the granny with a sparkle in her eyes. The way the scene turned out showed James McAvoy might have some competition from little sis soon on the serious drama front. As for Alanrsquos attempt to comfort her, ldquoDo ye want a tangerine , how pure dead Scottish male was that Certainly, the jokes in this fourth series are easier to see coming than before, but by this stage in the game the comedy is coming more from the characters than the situation.

Ghost, known by its registration plate AX , was built by Rolls-Royce in  and soon earned global fame for its quietness, luxuriousness and price.It is considered something of a holy grail among enthusiasts and is thought to be the most valuable motor in the world, with an insured value of pound million.Last year, Rolls-Royce launched a new, limited edition car to commemorate the history of AX , named the Silver Ghost Collection.Just  were produced and are on sale for hundreds of thousands of pounds.But a curious fact about the carrsquos famous Spirit Of Ecstasy hood ornament has come to light almost a year after it first launched ndash and one that Rolls-Royce has not even advertised to the public.The bottom of the statue on the bonnet of the  Silver Ghost Collection models contains a small copper ingot, marked with the AX  insignia of the original car.Rolls-Royce enthusiast Ruth Blair has revealed the copper is, in fact, taken from a pipe on the original  car that has been melted down and placed on to the  model in homage to the Silver Ghost.Mrs Blair, a charity fundraiser who has a farm near Cumbernauld, said she acquired copper from the original Silver Ghost after it was reconditioned in  by Rolls-Royce heritage experts Paul and Andy Wood.The brothers replaced some copper piping from the engine bay of AX  and ious steel components, and kept them for  years, waiting for an appropriate way to use them.In  they gave the metal to Mrs Blair, who at the time was creating a miniature Rolls-Royce for children that she eventually sold to raise money for charity.Realising the immense value of the parts, she sold them back to Rolls-Royce in  for an undisclosed amount of money and suggested the manufacturer create a limited edition tribute car to its most famous model.The company then commissioned  cars and has sent them all over the world to be sold to wealthy collectors, investors and enthusiasts.Last night, a sales representative of the Leven Car Company said the source of the ingot was kept a secret until salesmen could be sure a potential buyer was serious about purchasing the car.Details of the car were also kept out of the public domain to protect the Rolls-Royce brand.A spokeswoman for Rolls-Royce said: ldquoThirty-fiveof the extraordinary and exceptional Silver Ghost Collection have been created by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.ldquoInidually, as customers purchase these cars, they are intrigued to discover the provenance of the small copper ingot at the foot of the Spirit Of Ecstasy, and are surprised and delighted at its origins.After researching the car on its release last year, Mrs Blair realised the company had not advertised that the copper at the base of its hood ornament had come from the original AX .She told The Herald she acquired and then sold the copper from the Silver Ghost, and that it had been kept a secret from Rolls-Roycersquos own potential customers.Her husband, John Blair, who is a former car salesman, travelled to the Rolls-Royce factory at Goodwood, West Sussex, while the cars were being manufactured.He learned that even the engineers working on the Silver Ghost collectionrsquos construction had not been told by the companyrsquos executives where the materials had come from.To practise creating a copper ingot, and not wishing to use the precious century-old copper, Rolls-Royce bought some of the material from a local scrapyard to create a prototype of what would become the limited edition Spirit of Ecstasy, she said.Now only one of the cars remains in the UK, at the Leven Car Company in Edinburgh.Mrs Blair still owns steel wheel assembly nuts, coach bolts and a starting handle spring from the Silver Ghost.And she says she is looking for a partner who may be able to help her rework or redevelop them.ldquoI originally gave them all the parts ndash the steel and the copper ndash and they gave me the steel parts back, she said.ldquoJohn took the parts down to Manchester, and everyone seemed to have an interest in the copper rather than the steel.ldquoIf you see a picture of AX , yoursquoll see itrsquos got circular bolts around the wheels, and thatrsquos it.ldquoThe car was restored but they tried to keep it as original as possible so they only took off parts that were well and truly gubbed.Mrs Blair also owns the registration plate  AX, which is a reversal of the famous carrsquos plate.She says she has had ldquoloads of Rolls-Royces, and that her fascination with them came from travelling in the back seat of a Rolls-Royce Corniche when she was a child.ldquoI had two brothers that were car mad, and Irsquove always loved cars, she

freshly-created spirit from Scottish distilleries and not blend it with others.The company then matured the whisky itself in barrels used to make other spirits.The so-called single-malt, which at the time made up a vanishingly small proportion of the worldrsquos whisky market, was championed by curators who wanted to develop unique flavours.The firm now has a huge collection of whiskies from historic and long-closed distilleries that it occasionally bottles and puts on the market.Now, after  years of maturing a whisky from the Glen Grant distillery, Gordon  MacPhail has uncorked the barrel and is selling bottles to customers for pound, each.For Stephen Rankin, director of prestige, whose great-grandfather John Urquhart selected the whisky for the company collection on June , , tasting Glen Grant for the first time is an ldquoemotional experience.He tried a dram from the cask with his cousin, who also works for the company.ldquoIn a nutshell, itrsquos incredibly smooth, incredibly mellow, but itrsquos got a huge amount of character and flavour, he says.ldquoWhen you drink something of this sort of age, it takes you back in time to things that were going on back then, in .ldquoYoursquore thinking about the Geneva Convention, which was to come out not long after that. It was years before we started putting men in space, and while ious things have happened, this whisky has quietly matured throughout all of that.Gordon  MacPhail competed with blended whiskies from labels such as Johnnie Walker and Chivas Regal in an approach that was considered eccentric at the time. The company refers to itself as a ldquocurator and creator,not a distiller.Mr Rankin describes the Glen Grant as having a dizzying array of flavours, including vanilla fudge, strawberries, raspberries, white stone fruit, orange peel, cinnamon, mahogany, mint and cardamom.It began le as spirit, produced by the Glen Grant distillery in Rothes, near Elgin. At the time, the distillery would have used traditional whisky-making practices and burned peat as fuel in its distillery.Gordon  MacPhail, located in Elgin, bought a cask of the spirit and began to mature it in a cask that had transported sherry from Spain. As the spirit matured into whisky, it borrowed the other spiritrsquos flavours, left over in the wood of the barrel.For the next  years, the cask stayed with the company, being checked regularly by members of the Urquhart family to measure the rate of maturation and the impact of the wood on the spirit.Last October, the family finally decided the whisky had reached its ideal maturity, and has produced  bottles from the -litre cask to be sold as part of its Private Collection range.The Private Collection is a selection of whiskies chosen by members of the Urquhart family from closed or little-known distilleries, which sell for huge amounts of money.It has a collection of whisky from  distilleries in Scotland, of which  no longer exist.Last year, a bottle of the companyrsquos  Glenlivet whisky sold at auction for more than pound,.The Glen Grant is bottled at the cask strength of . per cent in a hand-blown crystal decanter and will be sold on the market for pound,.Mr Rankin says there are three types of people who typically pay thousands for a bottle: collectors, investors, and what he calls the ldquoRegular Joes, for whom the history of a whisky and its rare flavours prove too much to resist.ldquoItrsquos like an antique, he says. ldquoIt cannot be recreated. You cannot go back to the s to remake this, and whisky back then was made dferently. People want to try things the way it was. Wersquove had regular people who probably live in suburbia, for example, but the story of the whisky will touch them on a level you canrsquot understand, because itrsquos personal to them.ldquoIt might be when their mother or father was born, or when their business was started, or when they were born. Therersquos lots of emotional tie-ins.For Mr Rankin, the emotion of drinking the  spirit comes from knowing it is members of his own family that have looked after the cask for decades.He said: ldquoMy grandfather George would have had a signicant role in the selection of whiskies, and he would have done this overseen by his father. He would then have passed on the skills to analyse and check maturing whisky to his children.

And when they , they have to speak to around , fellow pupils about their experiences.“We see them transform from painfully shy youngsters into young adults who are confident enough to lead the expedition.“Our pupils have gone on to study at university and be leaders in their fields.

Discussions on the future of the service were scheduled to take place in November but were delayed to allow extra time to take residentsrsquo views into account - proposed service changes have been amended as a result.Proposals to close the Insch Household Waste and Recycling Centrehave been removed as a result of public feedback. It is proposed that the centre would stay open two days a week, with the cost to be covered by slightly shortening opening hours at other recycling centres.Changes to kerbside services have also been proposed and, out of the two options consulted on, councillors are recommended to choose the option which will give residents a  litre non-recyclable waste bin to be emptied every three weeks. Paper card and metals, cartons and plastics recycling bins would also be incorporated into the -weekly collection cycle, together with a weekly food waste collection. Although a dferent option was more popular in the consultation, professional advice is that the alternative is most likely to encourage residents to recycle more and send less waste to landfill.By increasing recycling the proposed change is expected to reduce service costs by at least £, per year, money which will be reinvested into other essential council services.It is also proposed to double the number of seasonal garden waste collection points, with new facilities in locations including Balmedie, Kemnay, Kintore, Mintlaw, Newmachar and Oldmeldrum.Aberdeenshirersquos current recycling rate is only .%, but the services currently available to residents should allow over % of waste to be recycled.

Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

The names of the companies involved have however, not been released.Minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: “Issuing the Invitation to Tender marks the next stage of the process to award the new contract to operate the Northern Isles Ferry Services.“The contract will run for eight years, allowing us to build a strong working relationship with the successful bidder, and all the routes within the network are being tendered as a single bundle.“The Scottish Government remains fully committed to high quality ferry services to the Northern Isles. A key benefit of this new contract is the in-built flexibility, allowing the ferry services to be amended to reflect future changes in demand across the important sectors of the islands’ economies – tourism, fishing, food and drink, aquaculture and farming. Scottish Ministers will also retain control of all of important issues, such as fares and timetables, through the public service contract.“We are committed to a fair, open and transparent tender which aims to get the best possible deal for the communities that depend on these ferry services.”• Commenting on the issue, Northern Isles MSP’s Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott said: “The Scottish Government have finally issued the tender. The timescale is very tight indeed given the operator needs to be up and running the North Isles leline ferry services in  months’ time. It is essential that companies make constructive bids with improvements to the existing service. It must, in particular, recognise the growing freight volumes that are being exported south to the Scottish mainland.“So the tender bids must be properly assessed to ensure the service moves forward and not backwards. And the endless saga of RET must come to an end, otherwise how can bidding companies submit a proposed fare policy ”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She agreed to look at ways the Scottish Government may be able to help in identying potential options.Commenting after these exchanges, Mr McArthur said: “It remains a concern that Orkney continues to be without a local abattoir. I am very conscious that the longer this remains the case, the more dficult it will be to find a solution.“I welcome the cabinet secretary’s willingness to re-engage with the Council and other local stakeholders in Orkney in an attempt to make sure that all possible options are fully explored. Mr Ewing acknowledged the importance of the Orkney beef and lamb brands not just to the islands’ but Scotland’s food and drink sector.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Set in , it sees protagonist Scott and his father James take the car ferry across the Beauly Firth to Inverness as they watch men working on the Kessock Bridge.Scott agrees to attend a farm roup with his father and feels he is being watched by a yellow eye from a dirty painting hanging amongst the lots. Unknown to his father, he successfully bids for it and his le starts to alter in remarkable ways.The action swings between Aberdeen and Florence as Scott embarks on a journey of discovery.Mr Herd, who describes himself as ldquo going on , said time spent alone working on so many films served him.He said: ldquoBy the nature of film work there wasnrsquot a typical day because all trips y. The most memorable film that I have worked on must be Swamp Tigers in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans.ldquoUsing a converted river ferry boat as a mobile base, a typical day would be, rising at four and travelling in the dark to a hide built on stilts embedded in a channel.ldquoI would stay there on my own usually for twelve hours and I did that for months. Being in a hide that long gives you plenty of time to think.ldquoLying awake in bed in the morning, plot ideas and characters nag at me and I have to get up to write about them.ldquoI am a hopeless two-fingered typist which is very frustrating because they canrsquot keep up with whatrsquos going through my head. That aside It does surprise me how easy it is for me to write, I donrsquot know where that comes from. I try to write at least a thousand words a day but quite often Irsquoll hit a brick wall.ldquoI donrsquot worry about that because I know that I will get the inspiration to carry on later.ldquoI try to write about what I know, itrsquos much more convincing and I use locations Irsquove been to. For example, in The Medusa Shield, Scott goes full moon night fishing off the Black Isle coast in a Zulu boat. While I was in India the fishermen on the east coast do that every month.The Medusa Shield is available from Amazon Kindle, Kobo and other digital publishers.Tuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The programme starting today will culminate with ldquomemory blankets that each participant will design and create.Evanton Wood education co-ordinator Simon Harry said: ldquoThis is a great addition to our summer dementia programme as we have secured funding to continue this programme of activities in the woods throughout the early part of this year.ldquoThe work will be focused at Evanton Community Woods utilising the woodland cabin as a base and using the surrounding forest environment to help bring to le the memories and ideas of the group.ldquoWe will be working closely with local artist Lizzie McDougal who has been a big hit with our group.He added: ldquoLizzie will lead the sessions with input from Evanton Wood staff and volunteers.ldquoThe process will start with two storytelling sessions in which Lizzie will encourage the sharing of memories and stories from each couple within the group. Lizzie and the group will then create sketches from these conversations to use as prompts for the group to aid their design of the memory blanket.The programme is supported by the UK-wide DEEP project , and the blankets will be used at a DEEP gathering to be run at Evanton Woods in the spring. This gathering will be a celebration of all the positive outcomes that those with dementia in the Highlands have achieved.The Evanton Wood programme will run each Friday from .am - pm at the woodland cabin which is a short walk from the top of Chapel Road.Those attending should follow the signs into the wood, and lunch is included.For more information about the activities on offer in Evanton Wood please contact Simon Harry on  or email simon.harry@forest-educationTuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

At the same time, our cost base is likely to increase owing to inflationary pressures on resources.ldquoThis year we are working on a strategy for trading through our funding gap, increasing income from charitable trading, reducing costs wherever possible and developing partnerships to share services.ldquoAttention has also been focused on non-financial risks arising from the loss of some channels of regular communication with our major funders our relationship with both Creative Scotland and the Highland Council has been strengthened during the year to March ,  and subsequently.ldquoThe development of positive relationships with funders ndash public organisations and inidual philanthropists ndash remains a high priority and is a central part of Eden Courtrsquos financial strategy for the coming three years.Total income increased from pound,, in  to pound,, last year. For the same period, total expenditure moved from pound,, to pound,,.Total funds also went up from pound,, to pound,,.Advance ticket sales mean that Eden Courtrsquos cash flow position remains strong.The biggest event of the year was the Snow White panto, which sold more than , tickets for its  performances.The report stated: ldquoAttendance for the year has been unprecedented with audiences of , for live performances and , at film screenings. The financial contribution from live performances was pound, higher than budget, boosted by some musical performances in the summer months and an excellent result from our Christmas pantomime.The wholly owned subsidiary Eden Court Trading experienced a rise in turnover from pound,, in  to pound,, last year, and an increase in pre-tax profit from pound, to pound,.The report added: ldquoOver the past four years we have seen substantial growth in trading through our restaurant, cafeacute and bars, and also in sales of confectionary, show merchandise and programmes by our front of house team.ldquoOur trading activities in   resulted in a surplus of pound,, an increase of  per cent over the previous yearrsquos result.ldquoWe will also implement a new strategy to attract philanthropy from trusts and foundations, and from within our community.Tuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

However, health chiefs have been accused of dragging their feet over helping to find a sustainable future model to deliver the scheme, which many of the users have said gives them a reason to get up in the morning.The project leader, who is employed by High Le Highland, has been told funding will end this month. According to Cllr Smith, garden users are ldquodevastated but adamant they wish to continue.She wants to see NHS Highland play a full role plotting the way forward, including carrying out self-directed supportassessments, a tool that aims to ensure people who are eligible for support are given the choice and control over how their inidual budget is arranged and delivered to meet their agreed health and social care outcomes.Tain-based Mike Herd, whose son has happily attended the scheme in Invergordon, said: ldquoNHS Highland made a commitment to me last year that they would try to help the garden project continue through a dferent funding formula. However, the reality is that letters asking for SDS funding have been ignored. It seems that NHS Highland have just abandoned the gardeners to a bleak futurelong-term funding cannot be agreed.Cllr Smith added: ldquoI make a plea, especially to big businesses locally, to contact me and offer some funding towards this worthwhile project that gives the adult users with learning disabilities pride and a reason to get up in the morning.ldquoIt is only a one-off payment I am seeking, not continual funding.NHS Highlandrsquos head of service for learning disabilities and autism, Arlene Johnstone, said: ldquoDue to financial pressures NHS Highland is no longer able to contribute funding to the Garden Project in Invergordon.

We have also introduced her to colleagues who have been able to advise of potential ways forward.ldquoNHS Highland is committed to ensuring that people with a learning disability can participate fully in our communities and therefore are also in discussion with High Le Highland and Councillor Maxine Smith to explore alternative ways of providing the activity that people enjoy.

The government believes it is in the best interests of the UK to remain in the EU. This is the way to protect jobs, provide security, and strengthen the UK#s economy for every family in the country # a clear path into the future, in contrast to the uncertainty of leaving. This is your decision. The government will implement what you decide.# So said the leaflet distributed to voters across the country at a cost of some £ million by David Cameron’s government. There was no equivocation. The people were being given the choice to decide the course the country should take in its relationship with the EU. A deal was not mentioned, like the ballot paper that would be presented, the question being put was should we remain or leave the EU Those words could not have made the choice more plain while stating the government believed we should remain, but nevertheless confirming the majority decision of the people would be enacted upon. We would expect nothing less. Our parliamentarians had agreed to hand the decision over to the people. We did not know at the time that the turnout of over million would mark the largest democratic expression of political will in Britain’s history. Ever.Now, more than two and a half years later as we approach our departure on  March, we are witnessing before us in open view of the public a well-organised attempt by parliamentarians to go back on their word. Some of them voted in favour of holding the referendum so the decision would rest with the people. Many voted in favour of invoking Article  of the Lisbon Treaty that meant the UK must leave the EU two years hence be there a “deal” for any future relationships or not. All of them have on many occasions said they would “respect” the outcome of the referendum and the solemn verdict of the people. Yet many of those who were on the losing side in the referendum, who claimed they would abide by the result– and still later claimed their fresh popular mandate by standing on their party manesto to leave in our entirety, deal or no deal – are now using every hour to betray their repeated promises.As the last few days of the  general election approached Anna Soubry, seeking re-election as the Conservative MP for Broxtowe, not only stood by her party and its manesto she went further and distributed an e-mail to electors that said, “I accept and will continue to honour the EU referendum result. We are leaving the EU”.During the same campaign fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve QC told voters, “the decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected” and went further to say of the parliamentary process that “our system works correctly to give effect to the referendum decision”.We now learn that Grieve, in cahoots with others who are intent of wholly disrespecting the referendum by seeking to annul the decision, is proposing to submit a parliamentary amendment that will introduce anarchy to parliament by wresting authority away from the majority and giving it to a minority. This is not about defeating the will of his own party he remains shamelessly a member of, or that of that the government he claims to support, but of ensuring even the will of parliament can be prevented from charting an agreed course – so that in descending into chaos nothing is possible. His amendment would allow only  of the  MPs – a  per cent minority – to take control of parliamentary procedure so long as five of that number are from dferent parties are ten are Conservatives.Grieve’s approach is starkyou cannot win by achieving a majority within the rules, then change the rules so the minority governs the majority. The purpose is clear, he wishes to obstruct the existing law wherebythe EU has not agreed a “deal” with the UK then the process of government being able to amend the law can be grabbed by a minority – not the majority – of MPs in parliament.Ironically what might stop Grieve’s amendment passing is a fear in the Labour leadership that were it to become established it could in future make le for any minority Labour government virtually impossible. Grieve needs the backing of Labour to pass his amendment, but Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell must realise the controversial programme they would dearly wish to introduce in time could be blocked repeatedly by MPs holding out for bargaining concessions unless they had a commanding majority.There is a great deal of comment being expended about why the country’s democracy is now in the mess that it is. Some blame David Cameron for calling the referendum, but he at least gave fair warning he would do so and then having been elected delivered on that promise.The reason we now have an impasse in Westminster is that MPs such as Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Nicky Morgan stood for election stating they would respect the referendum result and have then broken their word. It is really that simple.MPs that voted for Article  to be invoked were voting for the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a transitional agreement before we departed. It is only because of their actions subsequent to the general election that Labour has been able to frustrate the government.Theresa May has to ask herselfseeking to wrest control of her government’s authority is really in keeping with Dominic Grieve – and those Tories who may support his plan – retaining the Conservative Whip and being able to stand as Conservative candidates in any General election they may cause. I cannot see how it can be justied. If Grieve moves his amendment the Whip should be removed so he can be judged for the consequences of his actions.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4859075.1547840122!/image/image.jpg","title":"vegans and meat eaters why they need each other jane bradley","story":"Vegans, carnivores and everyone inbetween should not fight over who is more moral, writes Jane Bradley.You would be forgiven for thinking that the whole world has turned vegan. Supermarket shelves are lined with meat substitutes: sausages, steaks and burgers. There’s even, from this week, vegan “fish and chips” in batter on offer from Quorn.Actually, just seven per cent of the UK population actually identies as vegan – although that is a  per cent increase on two years earlier – according to figures published last year by Comparethemarket. Yet there is no doubt there is a growing, and welcome, movement towards plant-based diets, whether for health or environmental reasons.A report out earlier this week claimed that people across the world need to cut down dramatically on meat and dairy consumption.Yet, like most things in the age of Twitter, it has somehow become a fight: plant-based food vs meat. Vegans versus omnivores. Are you a true vegan or, like my friend, someone who eats an entirely plant-based diet but still owns leather shoes and bags she bought pre-conversion, so is scared to call herself a vegan for fear of being branded a hypocrite This week’s report, compiled by  scientists forming the EAT-Lancet group, paints a stark picture of what we should be doing to combat climate change. Their suggested daily diet includes just  grams a day of red meat, which equates to around two small steaks a month g of chicken g of fish and g of dairy, the equivalent of just one glass of milk along with about one and a bit eggs a week. On the other hand, g of fruit and g of vegetables a day would be required to fill us up.Whether or not the EAT-Lancet’s plan should be followed – and there has been some backlash as to the independence of the investigation – in practice, it never will be, not by everyone.What people are scared of is extremes. Someone who enjoys a processed-meat fried breakfast every day is not suddenly going to switch to a vegan lestyle, no matter how many plant emoticons someone tweets at him.: Sean Murphy: Growth and popularity of veganism in the UK showing no sign of slowingA colleague, not usually known for following a good diet, on  January, decided he was to have a massive lestyle sht. Suddenly, gone were the processed foods and sugar-laden snacks: in came an entire grocer’s worth of fruit and vegetables packets of unsalted nuts and boxed leftovers from nutrient-rich, home-cooked dinners.For a couple of weeks, he was a paragon of virtue, swapping healthy-eating tips with his deskmate, a formerly hard-living hack turned tumeric-tea-drinking-almond-milk-quaffing puritan.But earlier this week, disaster struck. We’re still not clear what caused this dramatic fall from the wagon, but on Wednesday, we found him guzzling a bottle of Lucozade washed down with a packet of Haribo, while he lunched on an entire pack of out-of-date croutons followed by a sausage roll.He had even, we discovered, covertly reverted to his old habits of scoffing a bacon roll – left over from a morning breakfast meeting buffet, and reheated in the office microwave.Yet,he had not taken things to such extremes in the first place, perhaps he would have lasted longer on his health kick, which would have good for not only him, but for the environment too.Increasingly, the argument for veganism comes from the animal-cruelty angle, rather than anything to do with health or even environmental arguments. For people who feel like this, this is a perfectly valid decision and they are entitled to make it. Yet, there are many who don’t and their views should also be respected. Of course, increasing animal welfare so that those animals we do eat have a better le before they are killed is obviously a positive thing.: Marks and Spencer launches vegan shoes and accessoriesAt a busy city centre restaurant in Edinburgh this week, my friendwas handed a “vegan and vegetarian menu” along with the a la carte and lunchtime offering from which I chose my meal. More restaurants have this option now – and so they should.Similarly, many years ago, when I lived in Cardf, there was an excellent vegetarian restaurant around the corner to my house which offered a single meat option. And why not  They focused on vegetarian food because that was what they did – and very well. But there was one offering which might appeal to some of its other customers who enjoyed meat. It was always busy. I wonder now, in today’s climate,that restaurant would do as well  I fear it may be boycotted by angry “true vegans” who felt that the restaurant was doing them a disservice.This is where things are going wrong. We should not ghetto-ise food choices, nor insist on slapping labels on everyone’s lestyles. If someone is generally vegan, but has a bacon sandwich once a month, who does that actually hurt  There is no need for things to be as cut and dried as whether someone is carniverous or vegetarian.We need to work together to stop climate change and we will not do that by breaking into camps of vegan and non-vegan, fighting against each other to get the moral upper hand. If most of us just cut down on meat, bought only higher welfare-ieties and ate less processed food, it would be a start, both for our own health and the health of the planet.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857392.1547647215!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon promises independence timetable in weeks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Theresa May is #deluding herself# by trying to persist with her Brexit red lines, and suggested details of the timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum would be revealed within #weeks#.The First Minister was at Westminster to meet with SNP MPs, and said an extension of Article  and a People’s Vote were the only realistic options to break the Brexit deadlock.However, she added: “I’ll say more about the timing of a referendum in the next matter of weeks.“I want to see the UK stay in the EU, I think that would be best for the whole of the UK... even when Scotland is independent, that serves our interests best as well.

A police investigation is taking place into the allegations made by two women and dating back to when he was first minister. But Mr Salmond won a legal challenge against the Scottish Government over its handling of the claims.The Scottish Government is carrying out a review of what happened and Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to independent advisers to consider whether she breached the ministerial code during meetings and phone calls with her predecessor. Mr Salmond said Ms Sturgeon’s focus should be on the drive to bring about independence. He said: “Nicola should be concentrating all her energies on the independence agenda where we will never have better circumstances. As far as I am concerned Westminster’s Brexit dficulty should be Scotland’s opportunity.” Ms Sturgeon is to give an update to the Scottish Parliament on her plans in the coming weeks. A formal request for a Section  order which would give Holyrood the authority to stage a referendum was rejected by the UK government last year, with Prime Minister Theresa may insisting “now is not the time” to revisit the Scottish constitutional issue amid the Brexit uncertainty. It is understood that a further request by the Scottish Government would also be rejected by Westminster.Writing in the Sunday National newspaper yesterday, Mr Salmond said: “One of our features in the national movement has been our inability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of our political opponents. We have tended to concentrate on the shape we’re in.“However, right now the Westminster political establishment is at its weakest point in my letime while the national movement is in good heart. There is not likely to be a better time to force the issue.”However former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars warned there is “no appetite” for a second independence referendum. He said: “There is no national Yes organisation in place – a prerequisite to success as many Yes activists and voters are not SNP.“No policy work has been done on the post-Brexit situation and thus we are not in a position to deploy then new policies in that post-Brexit new paradigm that will be needed to convince No voters to vote Yes next time.”Polls indicate there has been no rise in support for independence among Scots since the last vote in  and Perth and North Perthshire MP Pete Wishart said a vote should be held when it can be won.He said: “We are already making progress towards that with Brexit as the catalyst. But it will be dficult to secure the conditions to make a referendum happen before the next Holyrood election.”Alex Bell, a former SNP government adviser also called for a more considered approach.He said: “The SNP and Yes have to stop seeing independence as a sneaky prize to be won when everyone  is messing up and instead base their campaign on the reality of what Scotland can achieve through an honest understanding of the world.”Ms Sturgeon had pledged to hold a second referendum in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but “reset” her plans after the SNP suffered heavy losses in the  UK election.At First Minister’s Questions last week, she said: “Given the catastrophe that Scotland faces in our economy, our society, our living standards, the prospects for the next generation and our reputation in the world, it is essential that the option of independence is open to people in Scotland.“When people in Scotland have the ability to choose independence, I believe that the country will opt to be an independent one.”The Scottish Parliament has already voted in favour of a second referendum following the Brexit vote as the SNP combined with the pro-independence Greens.\u2028Scottish Secretary David Mundell has written to Mrs May to urge her to maintain her refusal to grant Holyrood powers for a second independence referendum.If the authority to hold a second referendum through a Section  is rejected, as expected, by the UK government, it has been suggested that the Scottish Government could make this the central issue of the next Holyrood election in , as it seeks to build the case for a independence in the years ahead.\u2028Tory constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins suggested Ms Sturgeon will seek a Section  order in the knowledge it will be rejected by in order to “stir up as much grievance and bad feeling as possible”.Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to abandon plans for another referendum. A Scottish Labour source added: “The last thing Scotland needs is more instability and chaos of yet another independence referendum, what our communities need are Labour governments here and in Westminster to end austerity.”An SNP spokesman said: “With the clock ticking down to Brexit date - and with the Tory government incapable of governing and Labour incapable of effectively opposing - the SNP will continue to focus on standing up for Scotland’s interests in the face of a disastrous Tory-driven Brexit and further austerity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848739.1547813565!/image/image.jpg","title":"these are the 6 most wanted people in scotland in 2019","story":"Can you help police track down these  men on their most wanted list Police Scotland would like to speak to the people below and are asking anyone with information to call .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vaarie ","story":"Offers over £,Detached four bedroom house, built in , with large garage and spacious garden, in excellent condition in quiet location  minutes from Lerwick."},{"url":null,"title":"lecturers go on strike at shetland college ","story":"Lecturers on the picket line outside Shetland College in Lerwick.A picket line has been formed outside Shetland College as lecturers campaign for an improved pay offer.Strike action was backed in December by . per cent of EIS-FELA union members on a turnout of . per cent.A total of  lecturers are taking shts to stand outside their Gremista workplace today , some holding placards with slogans including: “The cost of living affects us all #negotiate now”.Shetland College branch secretary Andrew Anderson said: “The last thing any lecturing staff want to do is take strike action because that does affect students and we don’t want that but we’ve been left with no other option – we’ve been put into this position.”The lecturers are wanting a better offer than that on the table – a . per cent rise covering -, previously branded “derisory” by Mr Anderson.for more..."},{"url":null,"title":"jobs template week 3 ","story":"We are initially inviting Notes of Interest from inidals who would be interested in joining our small dedicated team.Positions available are:Permanent and seasonal opportunities are available, ious hours will be considered.Wage is dependent upon age and experience.

It is due to reach the KPL facility early next week, although earlier this week it was moored off Ullapool during high winds while the tug ‘Ievoli Black’ sheltered in Gruinard Bay. The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen. I believe much of the Inner Sound gear has been cleared from the anticipated path of the rig.“I spent a whole day moving my own gear. We can only hope that the rig sticks to the route given. It#s been quite a lot of disruption to many of the fishermen andthe rig deviates even a hundred or so metres there is still plenty of opportunity to foul the moved. and now more-densely packed fishing gear but at least in the area where I am working there has been a -plus metre corridor cleared where the advertised track says the rig will be.“No doubt there are some fishermen who are on holiday or who for whatever reason have not had the opportunity to clear all their gear. However, so long as the OGW sticks to its route damage should be minimised.”Despite the optimism, Mr Philp said he wasn’t sure what “process or policy is in place” in the event of damaged or destroyed gear.He added: “I would suggest that, considering this the first time this has happened in over  years, we assess the outcome from the passage of the rig and then cross that bridge when we come to it. So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1380213.jpg--.jpg?1547207055000\n","title":"57 job losses confirmed by administrator jbe not feasible","story":"The Administrator for JBE Mechanical.Electrical Ltd, the Ballymena based electrical and mechanical firm, has announced that following a review of all options in respect of the business, that it is not feasible for the business to continue to trade.Speaking following a meeting with all staff at the firm’s headquarters at Braid River Business Park in Ballymena, the Administrator Gerard Gildernew said: “Unfortunately, following our review of live contracts and the company order book, I have concluded that it is not feasible to continue trading the business in administration.

For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  .

When the war was at its height, the factory started making unorms for the soldiers. From her house in Kinallen, she could see the lights of Belfast light up the sky when the German bombers came.“Just after the war, in , Mrs Jess married and went on to have three daughters.

Seymour Hill Primary School was built by September  when the first pupils started the school. “She started working in the school when it opened in  and she worked in the school for over  years until her retirement.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

They are told with the reverence and respect you would expect from someone whose fictional characters populate the very streets and alleyways he himself walked and walks. These are stories sympathetically woven from yarns shared at wakes and barricades and they are told with all the authenticity and captivating power of a backstreet seanchaí.And while the protagonists are sympathetically drawn — there are no psychopathic terrorist godfathers or feeble-minded IRA cannon-fodder here — there is deceit, treachery and even murder.If your conception of Ballymurphy circa  is based upon the ramblings of our mainstream media commentators scrambling for credibility or the pulp fiction ravings of Jack Higgins, then the short stories in ‘Gáire in Éag’ will be like epistles from another planet. If, however, you actually knew people who stored weapons for the IRA, sheltered republican active service units, engaged in armed struggle for the IRA or even betrayed the IRA — and most probably called them your neighbours — then these stories of ordinary people in extraordinary times is a tonic for the retired troops. Of course, to enjoy this exceptional collection, you will have to be able to read Irish, the literary language of ‘John Boy’ Ó Muireagáin, evennot his mother tongue. That, the author says, is the book#s strength — evenit means not all those who would be able to recognise themselves in its pages will get to enjoy it.“I don’t think you would get a publisher for this book in English,” says Seán . “To be published in English on the topic of our conflict, you need to have a certain point-of-view which often has not even the faintest connection to the reality we experienced. In ‘Idir Dhá Thine Bealtaine’, I tell the story of a woman who kept an arms dump for the IRA. I don’t judge her but I dotell her story as a writer who is very proud of the republican and nationalist people from whom I come. After all, the people who hid IRA weapons were, some might say, more heroic than the people who did the shooting. Every night, they went to sleep dreading the early-morning raid. And yet, no-one is telling the story of those overlooked heroes who are at the core of any revolution ” A member of the extended Ó Muireagáin tribe which spearheaded the Irish language revival in the Upper Springfield area, Seán, now , didn’t start writing until he was well into his forties. “I started with poems about ten years ago,” he says. “They helped me make sense of my own le but about four years ago I started to try my hand at short stories. I wanted to tell the story of my own community, a story which hasn’t been told despite the mountains of books which have been written about us. I felt I could do that in Irish easier than in English. The Irish language community is tighter and more understanding than the larger English language public and you can sidestep the inevitable condemnation which would rain down on anyone who wrote stories with this worldview in English.”His fluent story-telling style is comfortable and engaging and firmly rooted in lives which would be considered humdrum and ordinarythere wasn’t a war raging in the background. His fealty to his subjects is reminiscent of the master Basque writer Bernardo Atxaga who tells the story of an entire people without leaving the tiny mountain village of Obaba. But the Ballymurphy man’s genius with words doesn’t stop there for in setting his stories against the background of the battlefield, he takes up the mantle of Kenya’s greatest author Ngugi wa Thiong’o whose books demolish the previously accepted white-man’s-burden version of the Mau Maustruggle against British colonialism. However, anyone expecting The Victor comicbook-style war stories of republican derring-do is likely to be disappointed.“The stories are about war and conflict at a very personal level how conflict affected the lives of ordinary people,” says Seán. “In ‘Sceithire# , I look at the informer not in traditional black and white republican terms but with empathy for the tout#s family and, of course, with an eye to the mirrors-within-mirrors nether world of informers.”The longest story in the collection, Pól, is a dark, macabre helter-skelter in which an enraged lover sets out on a murderous rampage, covering up his deeds in the undergrowth of Troubles’ killings. “I always wonderedsomeone with malign intent could literally have got away with murder and through Pól I get to let my imagination roam free,” says Seán. “However, no-one should reopen any cold cases all my characters are fictional. True, many are inspired by a titbit of true information or by a real event but ultimately, this is fiction not loose talk.”Seán is keen to let his short stories do the talking for him but he does have a fascinating story of his own to tell — perhaps in memoir form now that he is taking early retirement from the Irish language agency Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta to focus on his writing. A poet, short story writer , a consummate sean-nós singer and even a stand-up comedian, Seán was a renaissance man before the term was invented but his renaissance started with the Irish language.“I am just an ordinary person who had the good luck to discover this Irish language which has nurtured me since I was a teenager,” he says. “Now I want to give back by writing plays, poems and stories which do justice to the ordinary people who make up my community and who have come through the most extraordinary times with their heads held high.”Seán Ó Muireagáin has no plans for an English language translation but what brought Atxaga and Ngugi to a wider audience, the gt of translation, could reveal this gem of a book to a wider audience in the time ahead. Indeed, that would be the perfect way to mark the centenary of our own wee country in ! A Dying Laugh indeed.‘Gáire in Éag’will be launched in An Ceathrú Póilí bookshop in An Chultúrlann at pm on Saturday  February."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"emma and clara go to the bolshoi","story":"THERE are very few places anywhere named after women. In Belfast we have load of Victoria places. A hospital, a shopping mall, a university. We also have a bridge named after Queen Elizabeth. Of course those named venues are not really about the women they are named after. We all know it is about their position, the reign of empire and monarchy.The only other place named after a woman that I am aware of is the Mary Peters’ Track. Unlike the aforementioned, it is hard to view that negatively. Mary earned it the hard way.There are also very, very, few places named after working class heroes. As we walk our streets in West Belfast we walk on the roads named after imperial battles or, less insultingly, places like Donegal. The exception is the Michael Ferguson Roundabout named after the beloved councillor who died too young but had dedicated his short le to the people of Colin.In the s, when standing in the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow, being hosted by Mikail Gorbachev, Mrs Emma Groves was handed a blini with caviar. She turned to the only other woman in attendance from West Belfast, Clara Reilly, and said, “I think I’d prefer a fish supper.” That night at the performance, Clara sat beside her friend Emma, who had no sight but could hear the glorious music, and she described to Emma the intricate costumes and the air-like dancing.Emma Groves and Clara Reilly were not there on a jolly. They were not invited as political favour. They had travelled to Moscow at the height of the Cold War to ask for help for the most forgotten and dismissed of victims of our conflict. They lobbied for Soviet support to end the use of plastic and rubber bullets. In the same breath we can mention a similar visit by these two women to Washington to lobby the other side of Cold War incredibly impressive human rights advocacy that would be recognised more universally had they not been Irish women from West Belfast highlighting British state abuses. Mrs Clara Reilly embodies the spirit of freedom. A spine of steel and a heart of gold. Her story is yet to be written. But she has some of that story still to write.When Emma Groves passed away, she was carried by those who loved her, including Clara, in a willow basket. She epitomised humility. It was no surprise that her final wishes were to contribute to the earth. She gave example to us all.Both women shone a light of humanity in the darkest of days. Despite horric violations of injury and bereavement visited upon them both, they could only think of others who they used their hearts and strength to support and advocate on behalf of. While other human rights advocates on this island looked to South Africa or Nicaragua in safety, these women stood in their own streets and insisted on human rights beginning at home.This weekend Belfast will have a new nameplate. This time for two working class women who would not be silenced or intimidated. Who refused to allow a line of expedient amnesia to be drawn during our peace process. Our streets become richer with their names. The history of human rights in Ireland will now speak of Emma and Clara. Our friends.

I worked there for a further two years under the stewardship of Jim Deery, who I owe a lot to. Jim really gave me a foot up when I needed it. I cut my teeth in the back streets of the New Lodge learning about social justice, community development and participative democracy.“I always knew I wanted to work with young people – it’s my passion. In St Malachy’s I spent as many free periods as I could get playing football as opposed to studying – I wanted to do teaching at that time, but I wasn’t really interested in the A-Levels I was doing.“There was always that draw to work with people, young people in particular. My mummy was always heavily involved in the community and volunteering, so I also have that family background.”After six years at the Star, Chris went on to become a Senior Development Officer at the Bytes Project before taking up a post as the Children and Young People’s Coordinator with Belfast City Council, where he helped set up a city youth forum and Belfast’s first skate park.Remarkably, he took up the Director’s role at NIYF just a few years later when he was just  years old. It presented a massive new challenge, which Chris insists he was well prepared to meet, despite his young age.“It was definitely in my DNA,” he said.“It’s about building the capacity of young people to affect positive change.“We always talk about young people being part of the solution as opposed to being the problem, and again I have to pay credit to Jim Deery, he was the one who schooled me in that chain of thought.“All of those people in the Star really heavily influenced my thinking. All of my jobs since leaving school, whether it was in voluntary or paid capacity, had that underbelly. It’s about people making positive change for themselves.“When the job in the Youth Forum came up it was like a dream job, it was allowing me to do something that I had been practising for years, but only on a regional basis.“The role here is very strategic. You’re linked into government, you’re linked into the EU, we’re presenting to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, so we’re doing all of this amazing work internationally as well as locally.“We are working with young people who are on the margins, such as homeless young people, and seeing those young people building their own capacity to affect change in their own lives and communities is amazing.”He continued: “Some days I feel like I should come in with a firefighter’s hat, because you spend an awful lot of time fighting fires and managing mini crises.“A big part of the job is strategising, lobbying and campaigning. I often talk about speaking truth to power, so it’s about bringing the voice of young people to those in a position of power. Sometimes that’s uncomfortable for those in positions of power, because you’re banging down doors to try to affect change for the marginalised people in society. Every day is a battle. You’re fighting a fight for people who are getting the rough end of the stick.”In an ever-changing world, the problems faced by young people have become increasingly complex, and Chris says that many of them are challenges faced by young people the world over. However, he believes that legacy of our recent conflict makes many of our own young people’s challenges unique.“Whether you’re in Belfast, Paris or Sydney, there are massive problems around mental health, drugs, poverty, exclusion and all of these things you can apply to any area,” he said.“The big thing here is the legacy of the past – it’s the lens that magnies all of these problems. I would relate a lot of the reasons our high suicide rates and mental ill-health to the conflict and the legacy of the past. There is a lot we still don’t know we talk about transgenerational trauma. You just need to look out the window and you can see people living with these issues and a lot of it is linked to the conflict. If we don’t deal with legacy and we don’t deal with the conflict then that’s not going to go away.”Despite the magnitude of the task ahead, Chris and the NIYF are relentless in their pursuit of a better society. After serving that eye-opening apprenticeship he now heads one of the largest providers of non-formal education in the country. There is undoubtedly a lesson to be learned from his experience.“I know it’s a cliché, but what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said.“Every time you are faced with a challenge it can be a valuable lesson. Again, another cliché, sometimes you learn more in failure than in success. I’m a great believer in ‘Mól an óige agus tiocfaidh sí – praise the youth and they shall prosper’.“In my work le and in my voluntary work teaching kids in sport I try to teach them about work ethic. I try to teach them that hard work beats talent and that talent doesn’t work hard.“The education system as it is set up is designed for maybe  per cent of high achievers, so in my opinion it is failing so many young people. Non-formal education, for us, is about finding that passion. For us it’s about encouraging young people to find the thing that lights the fire in their belly.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"image of the day monday","story":"Renowned human rights activist Clara Reilly looks on as Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey and West Belfast MP Paul Maskey unveil the sign at the newly-named Groves Reilly Corner – Coirnéal Groves Reilly – on the site of the former Andersonstown Barracks.

I’m so proud of the boys – that was some performance.”Naomh Éanna settled into the game quickly and a goal from the impressive Kristian Healy, following good work from Nagle and midfielder Ethan Gibson, put them into a - to - lead on eight minutes.The pace of the Naomh Éanna attack created numerous goal chances in the first half, with Liam Kelly making a last-ditch clearance to deny Odhran Eastwood, but the Ulster side didn’t have long to wait before finding the net again.On  minutes, Joe Maskey and Kristian Healy put centre-forward Ruairi Scott through on goal and, despite Manus Breathnach’s best efforts in the An Spidéal goal, the shot had too much power and trickled into the net.The Galway men were reliant on free-taker Antaine Ó Lao to keep them in touch, with the centre-forward landing four frees in the first half.Yet their defence was being repeatedly unlocked by the sheer pace of Naomh Éanna, who forced several turnovers.With  minutes played, goalkeeper Breathnach was caught in possession around midfield and dropped the ball under pressure from James McAuley and Maskey with the former gathering possession.After talking a few steps forward, Maskey unleashed a shot with the outside of his right boot which carried  yards into the unguarded net.Leading by six at the break, Naomh Éanna never looked in danger of losing the game with Eastwood unerring from frees – finishing with a haul of -, with one from play. An Spidéal’s discipline undermined any slim hopes they had of getting back in the contest, with Eoin Ó Droigheáin and Conal Ó Caoimh picking up black cards either side of Ó Lao’s dismissal as Naomh Éanna held their nerve to claim a seven-point victory.

Under the terms of an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve and controversially passed by MPs, today is her deadline to present a new plan to MPs.While the details of this Plan B are not clear, the chairman of the Eurosceptic European Research Group Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote in the Mail on Sunday that it was possible for Mrs May to get a deal through the Commonsshe persuaded the EU to show flexibility on the backstop and £bn orce bill.“If I had to choose between a no-deal and Mrs May’s original accord, I would have no hesitation of opting for no-deal Brexit, but even Mrs May’s deal would be better than not leaving at all,” he wrote.Read MoreDowning Street rejects claim PM wants to change Good Friday AgreementLeaving without deal would be a disaster, says farmers’ unionRemainer MPs are trying to steal Brexit, says FoxIt’s good to talk:Mrs May has offered to talk to Opposition parties and groups with dferent desires and views to find consensus in Parliament. But her refusal to abandon no-deal Brexit and other leaders’ refusal to speak properly until she does, suggests one party will need to cede some ground.Also writing in the Mail on Sunday, chief Brexit representative for the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt said: “If necessary, this document could still be enhanced in the next coming weeks.“British politicians will always find an open door to do that, but they must act soon.“This will only happenpolitical parties in the UK start to work together.“Such a cross-party approach is not natural to the adversarial UK political system, but it’s time to change course and to put the national interest ahead of narrow party political interests.”Confidence vote .:The Opposition can in theory call as many of these votes as they like, although the Lib Dems have said they will not support another as they believe it is a waste of time.Such a vote could trigger a general election but this is very much the nuclear option for Tory rebels and the DUP has already said it will not vote with Labour, so it appears to be unlikely.Back to Brussels for more talks:The EU has said repeatedly that it will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement, and “assurances” on the Irish border backstop were dismissed by Brexiteers earlier this week. There is little time and no clear indication what more the EU can or wants to offer. France has stepped up its no-deal preparations.Asking for an extension of Article :Mrs May has previously insisted almost to the point of foot-stamping that Britain will leave the EU on March , and a U-turn here would enrage already puce Brexiteers.But writing in The Observer, Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: “The PM has pushed us dangerously close to the exit door with perilously little left on the clock.“So it’s vital that immediate steps be taken to extend Article .“Not to stop Brexit, but to ensure that there’s time to force a change of Government, or find a solution Parliament can back.”Halting of Article :A court case last year ruled that, while all  other EU states have to agree to extend the Article  process of leaving, the UK can unilaterally reverse it.Neither the Tories nor Labour support a halt, but Philip Hammond reportedly told business leaders in a conference call on Wednesday that a bill being rustled up by backbenchers would have this as its aim.A second referendum:Labour members at conference left the door open to supporting a new vote on leavingthe party could not trigger a general election. Mr Corbyn was applauded by Labour activists when he pointed this out in a speech on Thursday. But he also indicated he would rather leave with a Labour-flavoured withdrawal agreement.Former Attorney General Dominic Grievewrote in the Sunday Times: “I have made no secret of my support for the People’s Vote campaign, but it is important to recognise that this idea may well gain support only at the end of a process when every possible Brexit option has been explored.“I do not doubt that legislating for a new referendum is a dficult decision and the last resort for many MPs. “No-deal Brexit:If Theresa May loses and Parliament cannot come together behind an alternative, the UK will leave the European Union on March  without a deal.This is something to either be afraid of, or not afraid of, depending on your view of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"change your red lines and eu could be flexible says coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

who placed this crude device in a busy city centre have absolutely no regard for the people who live and work there.”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds welcomed Ms Bradley’s assertion that the bomb was unrelated to the Brexit debate, adding it is also “somewhat unrelated” to Stormont’s collapse.He said: “Let us not legitimise in any way what these people are about by ascribing to them a cause – these are people who want to destroy communities on both sides, who want to disrupt, who want to bring nothing positive and who have no agenda whatsoever, and therefore I totally support what the

Army bomb disposal experts later carried out a controlled explosion on the van.Just over two hours later, at .pm, police received a report that four masked men – one allegedly armed with a gun – hijacked a postal delivery van on Southway.Police said the two occupants of the van were ordered to drive the vehicle to the Lonemoor Road and leave it there.Both incidents prompted sizeable security alerts, with nearby residents evacuated.Police Service of Northern IrelandSuperintendent Gordon McCalmont warned of widespread disruption.“We understand the effect this will have on the local community, but we will not take any chances when it comes to keeping people safe,” he said.On Monday evening, police attended on Northland Road in the city after an Asda van was left parked across the road in front of St Mary’s secondary school.Ms Bradley told the Commons that a “crude, unsophisticated” explosive device was used in Saturday’s bomb attack and said CCTV had showed “teenagers and others passing by only minutes before the device detonated”.She said: “It is sobering to think that a truly sickening outcome by those responsible was only narrowly averted.”The Conservative MP added: “Those who planned this attack and who placed this crude device in a busy city centre have absolutely no regard for the people who live and work there.”DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds welcomed Ms Bradley’s assertion that the bomb was unrelated to the Brexit debate, adding it is also “somewhat unrelated” to Stormont’s collapse.He said: “Let us not legitimise in any way what these people are about by ascribing to them a cause – these are people who want to destroy communities on both sides, who want to disrupt, who want to bring nothing positive and who have no agenda whatsoever, and therefore I totally support what the Secretary of State has said in that regard.”Ms Bradley later denied that she had brought up “border polls” in the region in talks about Brexit, calling claims on the subject “rumours and supposition”."},{"url":null,"title":"may never considered reopening good friday agreement further backstop talks planned with dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She paid tribute to the bravery of the local police and community. She said that Northern Ireland could never be allowed toto the \"violence and terror of the past\".Mrs May acknowledged that the governments approach to Brexit \"had to change\" and called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to engage in the negotiation process after he refused to meet her last week.She acknowledged the widespread concern that the UK could be headed for a no-deal Brexit, but said the only valid way to rule it out was through an approved exit deal with the EU.The PM said she did not believe that there was the necessary support for a second referendum on Brexit and ruled out extending Article  to prolong negotiations.She said a second referendum could set a dangerous precedent for those who want to break up the UK.Mrs May said that, as part of her new approach, she was planning further discussions with the DUP and members of her own party over concerns surrounding the backstop.The DUP believe that the backstop, a plan to avoid a hard border, would effectively create a trade border in the Irish Sea and could leave Northern Ireland indefinitely linked to the EU.\"I will be talking further this week to colleagues, including in the DUP, to consider how we might meet our obligations to the people of Northern Ireland and Ireland in a way that can command the greatest possible support in the House,\" Mrs May said.\"And I will then take the conclusions of those discussions back to the EU.\"As part of her new plan she said she would seek opinions from across the political spectrum as well as the civic and business communities.Mrs May announced a greater role for the devolved institutions and said she would attempt to engage with Northern Irelands elected representatives in the absence of an Assembly.She told MPs that the government would provide more information about negotiations to MPs behind closed doors, in a bid to head off renewed use of so-called \"humble addresses\" to obtain confidential information.Mrs May announced that the £ fee for EU citizens applying for so-called settled status to secure the right to remain in the UK after Brexit will be scrapped.\"The next phase of testing of the scheme for EU nationals to confirm their status has launched today,\" she said.\"And having listened to concerns from members and organisations like the Three Million Group, I can confirm today that when we roll out the scheme in full on the th March the Government will waive the application fee so that there is no financial barrier for any EU nationals who wish to stay and anyone who has or will apply during the pilot fee will have their fee reimbursed.\"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds condemned the Londonderry bomb attack and thanked Mrs May for recognising there are \"core issues\" with the Withdrawal Agreement.\"Can I take it from what the PM has said that she is really serious now, in terms of getting a consensus that can get this through the House, with the necessary legal changes to the Withdrawal Agreement ,\" he said.\"Yes,\" said Mrs May. \"Obviously what I want to do is to identy the way forward in relation to dealing with the issues that have been raised by the backstop - Ive referenced the two key issues on its potential permanency and the impact on the union in my statement - and find the best way we can resolve those issues that will command support from this House.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts bishop street in londonderry reopened","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

change is one of the greatest challenges facing Ireland.Mr Higgins made the remarks during a keynote address to mark the centenary of the first sitting of Dail Eireann.Mr Higgins said: “Across the world, we are witnessing theof an ugly, xenophobic corruption of nationalism, long since thought vanquished from our political le.“The duty to welcome and shelter those fleeing war, persecution and famine – so often relied upon by Irish men and women throughout the ages – is now being openly disdained, even discarded, by elements in our European Union.”A special commemorative event was held on Monday at Dublin’s Mansion House to coincide with the -year anniversary of the first public sitting – which took place on January , .Parliamentarians from both the lower and upper houses of the Irish parliament held a joint sitting in the round room of the Mansion House to commemorate the occasion.TDs and senators, direct descendants of the members of the first Dail, MLAs, ambassadors and representatives from parliaments across the EU were among the invited guests.The first Dail represented an act of extraordinary imagination and courageMichael D HigginsFacebookTwitterMr Higgins warned attendees of the dangers of climate change.He added: “In this century, our planet and our people face new dangers undreamed of by our forebears: the disastrous loss of natural habitats and species both here and across our shared and vulnerable planet, and the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change present the Ireland of today with stark challenges.“Challenges that cannot wait to be addressed.”He also told those gathered that the establishment of Dail Eireann was not only a revolutionary act of national self-determination, but “an act of defiance against an empire that ruled over vast territories and erse peoples, an assertion that sovereignty belonged not to the Crown, but to the Irish people alone”.“Given the great forces ranged against that claim, the first Dail represented an act of extraordinary imagination and courage, a courage that would be called upon to be matched and surpassed by the Irish people time and time again in the turbulent and dficult years that followed,” Mr Higgins said.Mr Higgins added that it offered the people of Ireland hope.“Our forebears were not merely opening a legislative assembly, they were founding a new nation, one capable of articulating and vindicating the rights and aspirations of the Irish people,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  President of Ireland Michael D Higgins addresses the audience Although there were only  elected members in attendance for the first session of the Dail – some  others were in prison and some refused to take their seats – it marked a crucial step in the country’s struggle for independence.Members claimed the right of Ireland to self-government and adopted a provisional constitution.The meeting took place within weeks of the  elections, in which  Sinn Fein candidates were elected.But the Sinn Fein elected representatives rejected the Westminster parliament and declared independence.Mr Higgins told those gathered that those who had assembled in  did so to realise a dream, but he said it must be remembered that the first Dail did not represent the aspirations of all the people on the island.“Many Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will join us today in celebrating the events of  years ago as a momentous step towards our independence,” he said.“Let us also acknowledge, however, that the legitimacy of Dail Eireann and its institutions was not accepted by a signicant number of people, particularly by a majority in the counties that were later to be incorporated into the entity that came to be Northern Ireland.”Mr Higgins added that it was important to reflect on both the successes and failures of the country’s collective past.In his speech, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar paid tribute to the country’s forebearers but he acknowledged that some of the ideals outlined  years ago had not yet been fulfilled.Mr Varadkar said: “Industrial schools, illegal adoptions, and mother and baby homes were a betrayal of those ideals.“Although today the rate of child poverty in Ireland is only a fraction of what it was  years ago, and is falling, we must do better.”The inaugural meeting occurred on the same day as the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence.The war raged for two years until , after which  of the  counties on the island of Ireland became independent of the United Kingdom.The Irish Free State was established in  as a result of

Eurozone leaders will decide on the post in coming weeks.Mr Draghi himself is coming to the end of his term on October . Speculation about candidates to replace him has focused on former Finnish central bank head Erkki Liikanen, Bank of France head Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Jens Weidmann, head of Germany’s Bundesbank central bank.Mr Lane is a former economics professor who has been on the ECB rate-setting council due to his job as governor of the Bank of Ireland. He was a candidate last year for the ECB vice president job that ultimately went to former Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos.Mr Lane has been described by analysts at ABN-AMRO bank as a centrist whose views fall between so-called hawks who oppose extensive central bank stimulus and doves who tend to favour more.Finance ministers are about to start a new appointment procedure for an @ecb Executive Board Member.

Mr Lane has stressed that current low rates and the bond purchases were “very expansionary” and constituted “a temporary phenomenon”, not a permanent state, while cautioning markets that “it would be a very risky strategy to bet that interest rates will remain so low forever”.National horse-trading plays a large role in such appointments.Ireland can argue that it has never had one of the top six ECB posts during the ECB’s -year existence."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit plan b all you need to know as theresa may lays out fresh plans to mps","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She is required to update MPs on her “Plan B” in the Commons on Monday.However, reports suggest she intends to instead press on with attempts to win over her own MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party by assuaging objections to the Irish backstop – aka Plan A.Brexiteer sht \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jacob Rees-Mogg said he would back Theresa May’s deal over no deal The PM met a group of Brexiteer former ministers on Thursday. Attendee John Whittingdale said it had been a “constructive meeting” and he was convinced an agreement that satisfies a majority of Tories and DUP remained possible.Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer MPs, has signalled that he may ultimately choose to support Mrs May’s deal.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the leading Eurosceptic said that, in a choice between the Withdrawal Agreement and no Brexit, he would back her deal.DUP on side \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds and DUP Leader Arlene Foster met the Prime Minister DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy, Nigel Dodds, also visited Downing Street for talks last week.Mrs Foster said the issue of the Irish backstop needed to be dealt with “in a very clear way”. Mr Dodds said the details on how progress could be made were being discussed but that it was not “useful to give too much of a running comment on the details”.Labour attacks ‘appeasement’ strategy\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has urged Theresa May to take no deal off the table Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet the PM unless she took “no deal” off the table. After she stood firm, he branded it a “empty and hugely expensive” threat that was wasting billions of pounds of public money.“It’s a pointless and damaging attempt to appease a faction in her own party when she now needs to reach out to overcome this crisis,” he said.Backbenchers in motionMrs May will table a “neutral motion” on Monday and backbenchers are expected to table a series of amendments.One seeks to give time for a Bill to suspend the Article  withdrawal processthere is no new deal with Brussels by the end of February. Another would allow a motion by a minority of  MPs – from at least five parties and including  Tories – to be debated as the first item of Commons business the next day.Brexiteer concerns over Commons ‘hijacking’ referendum\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  International Trade Secretary Liam Fox accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ‘hijack’ the  referendum vote. The backbenchers’ manoeuvres could also explain a softening of opposition to Mrs May’s deal among Brexiteer MPs. On Sunday, leading Brexiteer Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to “hijack” the  referendum vote. Downing Street said it is “extremely concerned” by the backbenchers’ moves.Another week to save her deal Despite suffering a historic defeat for her deal last Tuesday, Mrs May appears to be pushing ahead with efforts to win over enough MPs to get it through. That would mean placating the opposition of nearly  Tory MPs and the DUP. The Bill will be debated and voted on – along with any amendments tabled by MPs – on January .

Lets do this together. Join us: https:t.co KwgFlgZHA pic otfeztp— Kamala HarrisJanuary , She made her long anticipated announcement on ABC’s Good Morning America.“I am running for president of the United States,” she said.“And I’m very excited about it.”Ms Harris portrayed herself as a fighter for justice, decency and equality in a video distributed by her campaign as she announced her bid.“They’re the values we as Americans cherish, and they’re all on the line now,” Ms Harris says in the video.“The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lting our voices to fight for our American values.”On ABC, she cited her years as a prosecutor in asserting: “My entire career has been focused on keeping people safe. It is probably one of the things that motivates me more than anything .”Ms Harris launched her presidential bid as the nation observes what would have been the th birthday of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had a deep conviction about what our country could be. He understood that racial justice was not attainable without economic justice. That everyone deserves access to a good job  safe working conditions. This MLK weekend, let’s keep his legacy alive. pic EsJJeXETb— Kamala HarrisJanuary , The timing was a clear signal that the Calornia senator – who has joked that she had a “stroller’s eye view” of the civil rights movement because her parents wheeled her and her sister Maya to protests – sees herself as another leader in that fight.She abandoned the formality of launching an exploratory committee, instead going all in on a presidential bid.Ms Harris plans a formal campaign launch in Oakland on January .The campaign will be based in Baltimore, with a second office in Oakland.Ms Harris joins what is expected to be a wide-open race for the Democratic presidential nomination.There is no apparent frontrunner at this early stage and Ms Harris will face off against several Senate colleagues.Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have both launched exploratory committees.Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are also looking at the race.If Mr Booker enters the race, he and Ms Harris could face a fierce competition for support from black voters.Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who unsuccessfully sought the  Democratic nomination, is also considering a campaign.Several other Democrats have already declared their intentions, including former Maryland Representative John Delaney and former Obama administration housing chief Julian Castro.Ms Harris launches her campaign fresh from a tour to promote her latest memoir, The Truths We Hold, which was widely seen as a stage-setter for a presidential bid.She is already planning her first trip to an early primary state as a declared candidate.On Friday, Harris will travel to South Carolina to attend the Pink Ice Gala in Columbia, which is hosted by a South Carolina chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which Ms Harris pledged as an undergraduate student at Howard University.The sorority, founded more than  years ago, is a stronghold in the African-American community.South Carolina, where black voters make up a large share of the Democratic electorate, is likely to figure heavily in Ms Harris’s prospects.And early voting in Ms Harris’s home state of Calornia will overlap with the traditional early nominating contests, which could give her a boost.Ms Harris’s campaign team is already taking shape and includes several veterans of Democratic politics.Juan Rodriguez, who ran Ms Harris’s  Senate campaign, will manage her presidential bid.Her sister Maya Harris, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, will be the campaign chairwoman.Veteran campaign finance lawyer Marc Elias will serve as the Harris campaign’s general counsel, and Angelique Cannon, who worked for Mrs Clinton’s  campaign, will serve as national finance director.David Huynh, who was Mrs Clinton’s director of delegate operations in , will serve as a senior adviser.Lily Adams, a Clinton campaign alum who has worked as Ms Harris’s spokeswoman, will be communications director.Her staff say she plans to reject the assistance of a super PAC, as well as corporate PAC money.She has invested heavily in cultivating a digital, small-dollar donor network before her presidential bid.Before her  victory in the Senate race, Ms Harris made her career in law enforcement.She served as the district attorney in San Francisco before she was elected to serve as attorney general.Ms Harris is likely to face questions about her law enforcement record, particularly after the Black Lives Matter movement and activists across the country pushed for a criminal justice overhaul.When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them inKamala HarrisFacebookTwitterMs Harris’s prosecutorial record has recently come under fresh scrutiny after a blistering opinion piece in The New York Times criticised her repeated claim that she was a “progressive prosecutor”, focused on changing a broken criminal justice system from within.Ms Harris addressed her law enforcement background in her book.She argued it was a “ choice” to decide between supporting the police and advocating for greater scrutiny of law enforcement.She “knew that there was an important role on the inside, sitting at the table where the decisions were being made”, she wrote.“When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in.”Ms Harris supported legislation that passed the Senate last year that overhauled the criminal justice system, particularly when it comes to sentencing rules.She is framing her campaign through her courtroom experience.The theme of her nascent campaign is “Kamala Harris, for the people”, the same words she spoke as a prosecutor, trying a case in the courtroom."},{"url":null,"title":"derry host northern ireland judge open championships","story":"The cream of Northern Ireland Judo talent and a host of international competitors are set

If they do not pay for the goods.

England is to introduce an opt-out system in .Mrs Taggart said: ldquoWe need to talk about the people who have lost their battle for an organ. We need to put faces to these tragedies and we all need to make sure our families know about our wishes.Mr McManus was buried last Thursday in his home town after he died from multiple organ failure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle Upon Tyne on December .Despite being put on a ldquosuper-urgent transplant list just days before Christmas, he succumbed to his illness as he waited for a suitable heart to become available.A successful mechanical engineer who travelled the world with his career, Mr McManus became seriously ill in .After six months of investigations, doctors diagnosed that Mr McManus had suffered cardiac arrest.A heart transplant was ruled out as he was too ill at the time, but doctors did all they could for him by fitting a mechanical pump in anticipation of a new heart.Despite being born with a congenital heart defect known as Transposition of the Great Arteries, the former De La Salle High School student had already defied the odds to live a normal le up until then.Raised in the Colmcille Road area of Downpatrick, Mr McManus ed home to be close to his father Tom mdash his mother Colette had passed away earlier mdash sisters Lisa and Roisin and their families.While he waited on the standard transplant list for three years, Mrs Taggart said that her brother bore his illness well.ldquoTommy was unable to work or travel and relied heavily on us for basic day to day things like shopping, cleaning, etc, she said.ldquoHis mobility was extremely limited through fear of over-exertion. Still, he did everything he could to aid his recovery.Tommy and his family were so thankful to the medical team at the Freeman Hospital for saving his le in  that they raised over pound, in order ldquoto pay back the care they had received.Mrs Taggart says that her family know that the doctors ldquodid absolutely everything in their power to keep Tommy alive and had promised that he would have had his heart transplant before Christmas.ldquoThere is a typical wait of between - days for a heart and we just donrsquot know why one didnrsquot become available.

He added:“Instead of a Plan B we got a rehash of previous statements and a commitment to inclusivity that is two years to late.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: “Today’s statement proves only one point – that the British state is in chaos. Boxed into a corner, the prime minister is running out of time and running out of options clinging to the DUP to help her hold on to power.”\"  \"  Police dealing with second bomb scare in N.I. housing estate - four masked men with gun hijack delivery vanBrexit: Theresa May dismisses claim she might amend Good Friday Agreement Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. man dies after he is electrocuted while fitting new lightN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownN.I. snow to arrive tonight and tomorrow - subzero temperatures to reach as low as -degC          ..

I have never even considered doing so.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcnally.jpg","title":"brexit immigration tips for employers","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business Due to the impact of Brexit, immigration law in the UK is set to substantially change. Facing this prospect, which key areas should employers be aware of, asks Philip McNally from KPMG Legal Services  Navigating the ongoing Brexit negotiations is a challenge, particularly for employers. Much is reliant on the make-up of any final deal but, armed with the right knowledge, there are some actions which both employers and employees can take now to make sure your business is prepared.  The rights of Irish British citizens: The most frequently asked question we encounter in KPMG’s immigration practice relates to the rights of Irish employees have to work in the UK, and British employees to work in the Republic of Ireland. Due to the impact of the Common Travel Area and associated rights and privileges, Irish citizens are not considered to be ‘foreign nationals’ in the UK, and British nationals are not considered to be ‘foreign’ in the Republic of Ireland. As a result, the right of Irish citizens to work in the UK, and of British nationals to work in the Republic, will not be impacted by Brexit.  The impact on recruitment If there is a transition period, employers will be able to recruit EU nationals , just as they do now, until December  . If there is no deal, it is unclear when “free movement of people” will end. However, it could end as early as March , .  The EU Settlement Scheme Under the EU Settlement Scheme, every EU national in the UK must make an application. The application will cost £ for each adult, and is due to open in March . This scheme is set to come into force whether or not a deal is concluded between the EU and UK.  Conduct an immigration audit In order to frame your immigration Brexit planning, we suggest that you conduct an initial audit of your workforce to gauge your exposure to Brexit. You should identy how many EU employees you have, their role and the location that they work in. Thereafter you can assess what you need to do to encourage and assist such employees to retain their right to work in the UK.  Make your plan Once you know your immigration exposure, you can plan your response. If you have a low percentage of EU Nationals working in your organisation, it may be sufficient to supply those workers with information about the EU Settlement Scheme, and hope that they make the application. However,you employ a high percentage of EU workers, we advise that you intervene and assist or get assistance for these workers to make the mandatory applications.  The post-Brexit immigration system Under the proposed post-Brexit immigration system , employers will face a number of challenges. These potentially include a minimum salary requirement of £, and the necessity for a work visa for EU nationals. As such, those employers who rely on low paid EU employees, are at risk of not only losing their EU workers but will struggle to recruit after  due to the post Brexit restrictions. Bearing that in mind,your organisation is affected in this manner, we advise that you retain your existing workforce by assisting them through the EU Settlement Scheme.  KPMG’s Corporate Immigration team is assisting employers and their workers in assessing their immigration status and supporting the relevant applications to minimise the effect of Brexit on the workforce.

According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.
