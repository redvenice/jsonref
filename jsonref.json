Or is there some way to both acknowledge its value yet still view it with a more critical eye?\u0027How are we meant to feel about art that we both love and oppose?\u0027 Molly Ringwald, who played the young protagonist in \u0027Sixteen Candles,\u0027 wrote this past April in The New Yorker, 34 years later. As the decades passed, she grew more uncomfortable with some of the material that made her one of the 1980s\u0027 biggest young stars.          The 1940 movie \u0027The Philadelphia Story\u0027 opens with a case of domestic assault played for laughs — Cary Grant shoving Katharine Hepburn to the ground by her face while a jaunty musical score playsEntertainment is a byproduct of its era. And the delicate question of representation pervades some of our culture\u0027s most beloved work, from Mark Twain\u0027s \u0027Huckleberry Finn\u0027 on down. It is the wonderful and the problematic, often presented side by side.So if we\u0027re watching \u0027I Love Lucy,\u0027 do we consider how belittling Ricky (and most everyone else) is to her? Or do we take away the fact that no matter what, she is never contained? If we\u0027re listening to the Beatles, what do we make today of John Lennon\u0027s 1965 song that began with the lyrics, \u0027I\u0027d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man\u0027?If we put \u0027Gone with the Wind\u0027 in front of our kids, what do we say when Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) acts like a happy slave who adores her masters? And for the Gen-Xers among us: What of Hughes, who captured teenage life\u0027s authenticity but also sent some fundamentally confusing and problematic sexual messages to adolescents?\u0027If you could erase all the scenes that are offensive to us today, even if you could, would that be a good idea? I don\u0027t really think so,\u0027 says M. Alison Kibler, who teaches American studies at Franklin \u0026amp Marshall College and researches how groups struggle for fair representation in entertainment.          Eight decades later, the movie is clearly two things: uneasy fare for a post-#metoo culture — and an enduring American classic. Whether it\u0027s blackface minstrel routines from Bing Crosby\u0027s \u0027Holiday Inn\u0027\u0027I would step back from any kind of one-dimensional read of movies and performances from the past,\u0027 she says.The \u0027Charlie Chan\u0027 movies of the 1930s and 1940s seem today to brim with racial problems: non-Asians portraying Asians, fortune-cookie sayings spouted in precious accents and some broadly played African-American representations too.Yet according to Yunte Huang, who traced the character\u0027s history, many Asians welcomed the films at the time because they represented something coveted: a respected Asian protagonist who outwitted every white person on the screen.\u0027There\u0027s a history to everything. And we need to know history — including those ugly representations and everything,\u0027 Huang says.Until the last couple decades, older fare resurfaced only sporadically. But the dawn of the digital era and the rapid rise of streaming culture means that now, anything can be accessed by pretty much anyone on any screen. That in turn means that a dizzying library of our cultural past, warts and all, is available at the press of a button.Consider Apu, the South Asian convenience-store owner long voiced by Hank Azaria in \u0027The Simpsons\u0027 — an unusual case because the show has ned more than two generations of evolving attitudes.Last year, comedian Hari Kondabolu released a film, \u0027The Problem With Apu,\u0027 documenting stereotypes he saw with the character and its effect on entertainers of South Asian descent. The response included hints that Apu might fade from the cast of thousands that populate the Simpsons\u0027 hometown of Springfield.That doesn\u0027t sit right with Shilpa Davé, author of \u0027Indian Accents: Brown Voice and Racial Performance in American Television and Film.\u0027 Apu, after all, is also a beloved character. Isn\u0027t there another solution?          While \u0027Birth of a Nation,\u0027 the groundbreaking 1915 film widely regarded as one of the most racist ever made, is viewed ever more harshly as the years pass\u0027The easy thing is to point a finger and say, \u0027Oh, that\u0027s terrible.\u0027 But I think we have to say, what are the alternatives? How do we want to progress now that we have more information and a higher consciousness?\u0027 Davé says.Tim Cogshell, a critic for FilmWeek on KPCC-FM, the NPR affiliate in Pasadena, California, thinks a lot about how yesterday\u0027s attitudes should be considered in today\u0027s environment. Part of his answer comes down to intent.\u0027Sometimes you have to peel the onion. And then one decides how to think about it, how to feel about it, where to put it in the canon,\u0027 Cogshell says.So while \u0027Birth of a Nation,\u0027 the groundbreaking 1915 film widely regarded as one of the most racist ever made, is viewed ever more harshly as the years pass, a misogynist bigot like Archie Bunker from \u0027All in the Family\u0027 presents a different story: Whether a successful portrayal or not, Cogshell says, it was intended to highlight a problem and get it discussed.The solutions suggest a general direction: Don\u0027t simply ban or eliminate or delete. Talk about stuff — whether formally, when it\u0027s presented to the public, or informally at home. And involving more voices in the production of today\u0027s popular culture — and the selection, curation and characterization of yesterday\u0027s — can make sense of this more than dismissing the issue as overreaction or scrubbing the leavings of less-enlightened eras.Let Molly Ringwald have the last word: \u0027Erasing history is a dangerous road when it comes to art — change is essential, but so, too, is remembering the past, in all of its transgression and barbarism, so that we may properly gauge how far we have come, and also how far we still need to go.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Pippa Middleton strolls streets ultra rich enclave St Barts","story":"Happy holidays: Pippa Middleton, 35, carries her baby Arthur on the Caribbean island of St Barts with her husband James Matthews, whom she married last year, following behind  He\u0027s found his papoose in life!

It was just plain. We were just trying to figure out how we could jazz it up and we both love Lego so came up with the idea of building an interactive wall that our friends and family could enjoy along with us.\u0027What began as a \u0027bit of a silly joke\u0027 quickly turned into something bigger.Ms Turford said: \u0027It seemed like quite a small and easy project at first but we massively underestimated how many bricks it took to even complete one line so quickly found ourselves scouting around for more.  Ms Turford and Mr Wilkinson (left) stuffed the wall with quirky characters, secret doors and Lego men (right) \u0027We didn\u0027t plan it. It just happened as we did it row by row.

It\u0027s gone a bit bonkers.\u0027The couple sought out the thousands of bricks used in the wall at car boot sales, auction houses and through online sellers - but became frustrated at how quickly they got through them.They say they have no idea how much they spent in total - but gave an estimate of a couple of thousand pounds.And in true Lego spirit, the couple think their creation is \u0027awesome\u0027 and routinely sing the Lego theme song \u0027Everything is Awesome\u0027.Ms Turford said: \u0027I love it all.

The bale of hay on my shoulder scratches into my neck the baler twine slices through my glove into my left hand. So does the wind, which comes seeking down the path, seeking me.The four red poll cows are at the top of the wood, in the middle of the oaks, forlorn backs to the wind. I toss the hay bale into the rack and almost run back to the Land Rover, to throw myself on the mercy of the heater.  19 December:I decide to let all the pigs out of the paddock to have a rummage at the south end of the wood, where they bulldozer away all morning, particularly under the sweet chestnut and beech, looking for old mast and new bluebells.‘Mast’ in botany is derived from the early German maesten, meaning to fatten or feed. A mast year is a natural phenomenon in which certain trees, such as ash, chestnut, English oak and beech, produce a glut of seeds. Beech, for example, produce a mast year every five to ten years. No one knows what produces a mast year, though self-protection, through fecundity, would seem to be an obvious explanation.  22 December:The bleak trees, the lonely silence, the dead leaves underfoot. There are no flowers it is really flowerlessness that gives December its distinction.  24 December:It is a year of holly berry dearth. The Viking birds, the redwings and the fieldfares, have descended from the north and plundered all the other hollies for miles around. In just two or three days.The scarlet and the green of the holly is shockingly vivid on this midwinter afternoon. Holly is apotropaic, the symbol of Christ, and was for centuries the physical mnemonic to remind us that ‘Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ on Christmas day in the morn’ because its berries are red like His blood, its prickles (‘sharp as any thorn’) are akin to the Messiah’s crown at crucifixion, and its leaves evergreen, an arboreal metaphor for eternal life.Is the Nativity superstition? Perhaps. In my family we have always believed it. In late summer my family decked their house with hops, at yuletide with the holly and the ivy.As a son of the country, I do not care to be without holly at Christmas. As a boy my grandfather gathered holly for the Christmas decorations. On this Christmas Eve I am his reproduction.In a wood, time obeys different laws. It is always the past.  25 December:A log on the fire an atavistic delight, which takes one way beyond childhood, Victorian coaching inns, Henry VIII’s Merrie England, to the beginning of human time.I myself sawed this log from a fallen arm of oak.The burning log warms body, soul, the night. And with the curtains drawn, we four are cave people, the walls flickering in firelight’s glow — the released sunlight of years gone by.Historically, the yule log burned at Christmas was an oak log, and the remains of the log were kept as charms against fire and lightning, and as kindling to light the next year’s yule log.  28 December:At the pig paddock I leave the tractor engine running, because on an afternoon like this, when the wind is flailing wire, it is warmth and heartbeat.Pavlov had a whistle to summon his dogs. I have a half-brick to call our pigs to dinner. I rap the brick bit against a steel trough. Ding, ding tings out over the glassland.The pigs are off in the wood, rummaging. Pannage, the practice of releasing pigs in woodland, was anciently important. Indeed, according to the Herefordshire Domesday not much else mattered locally. ‘There was woodland there for 160 pigs, if it had borne mast,’ runs the entry for Pembridge. Pannage also kept beech nuts and acorns away from cattle and horses, who find them poisonous.The ‘girls’ are safe enough out in the wood but, akin to an anxious father, I like to make sure they are back in their home field at night.There is no answer from the pigs. Damn. This time I bash the trough with the brick. Dong, dong bells out the vandal sound echoes around the hard hills.From the recess of the wood, from the recess of time, there is a pig’s answering squeal.Down come the pigs, shadow shapes weaving in and out of the dulled columns of beech.The pigs follow the old path, pounded into the clay by generations of animals’ feet, by Brock, by Reynard, by Bambi. The path only seems to meander aimlessly. It took me a year of walking it to realise that in its avoidance of subtle hazards and inconveniences it was the fastest, surest way through the trees.Once, some American academics pitched a computer against cows in a competition as to which could find the quickest route over rough terrain. The cattle won every time. You see, the animals know best.The pigs seem particularly bonny tonight. Does landscape change an animal’s mood, their behaviour? Pigs are the descendants from the wild swine that inhabited the larger forests of Britain. I do not believe it fanciful that our pigs have the happiness of feeling at home, of existing in their rightful habitat.  30 December:Oddly aware, walking through the wood this afternoon, that it is dormant rather than dead. How the seeds, the trees and hibernating animals (the hedgehog, toad, frog, snake, the thousand butterflies, the billion insects) are locked in a safe sleep against the cold and wet.

As the decades passed, she grew more uncomfortable with some of the material that made her one of the 1980s\u0027 biggest young stars.          The 1940 movie \u0027The Philadelphia Story\u0027 opens with a case of domestic assault played for laughs — Cary Grant shoving Katharine Hepburn to the ground by her face while a jaunty musical score playsEntertainment is a byproduct of its era. And the delicate question of representation pervades some of our culture\u0027s most beloved work, from Mark Twain\u0027s \u0027Huckleberry Finn\u0027 on down. It is the wonderful and the problematic, often presented side by side.So if we\u0027re watching \u0027I Love Lucy,\u0027 do we consider how belittling Ricky (and most everyone else) is to her? Or do we take away the fact that no matter what, she is never contained? If we\u0027re listening to the Beatles, what do we make today of John Lennon\u0027s 1965 song that began with the lyrics, \u0027I\u0027d rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man\u0027?If we put \u0027Gone with the Wind\u0027 in front of our kids, what do we say when Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) acts like a happy slave who adores her masters? And for the Gen-Xers among us: What of Hughes, who captured teenage life\u0027s authenticity but also sent some fundamentally confusing and problematic sexual messages to adolescents?\u0027If you could erase all the scenes that are offensive to us today, even if you could, would that be a good idea? I don\u0027t really think so,\u0027 says M. Alison Kibler, who teaches American studies at Franklin \u0026amp Marshall College and researches how groups struggle for fair representation in entertainment.          Eight decades later, the movie is clearly two things: uneasy fare for a post-#metoo culture — and an enduring American classic. Whether it\u0027s blackface minstrel routines from Bing Crosby\u0027s \u0027Holiday Inn\u0027\u0027I would step back from any kind of one-dimensional read of movies and performances from the past,\u0027 she says.The \u0027Charlie Chan\u0027 movies of the 1930s and 1940s seem today to brim with racial problems: non-Asians portraying Asians, fortune-cookie sayings spouted in precious accents and some broadly played African-American representations too.Yet according to Yunte Huang, who traced the character\u0027s history, many Asians welcomed the films at the time because they represented something coveted: a respected Asian protagonist who outwitted every white person on the screen.\u0027There\u0027s a history to everything. And we need to know history — including those ugly representations and everything,\u0027 Huang says.Until the last couple decades, older fare resurfaced only sporadically. But the dawn of the digital era and the rapid rise of streaming culture means that now, anything can be accessed by pretty much anyone on any screen. That in turn means that a dizzying library of our cultural past, warts and all, is available at the press of a button.Consider Apu, the South Asian convenience-store owner long voiced by Hank Azaria in \u0027The Simpsons\u0027 — an unusual case because the show has ned more than two generations of evolving attitudes.Last year, comedian Hari Kondabolu released a film, \u0027The Problem With Apu,\u0027 documenting stereotypes he saw with the character and its effect on entertainers of South Asian descent. The response included hints that Apu might fade from the cast of thousands that populate the Simpsons\u0027 hometown of Springfield.That doesn\u0027t sit right with Shilpa Davé, author of \u0027Indian Accents: Brown Voice and Racial Performance in American Television and Film.\u0027 Apu, after all, is also a beloved character. Isn\u0027t there another solution?          While \u0027Birth of a Nation,\u0027 the groundbreaking 1915 film widely regarded as one of the most racist ever made, is viewed ever more harshly as the years pass\u0027The easy thing is to point a finger and say, \u0027Oh, that\u0027s terrible.\u0027 But I think we have to say, what are the alternatives? How do we want to progress now that we have more information and a higher consciousness?\u0027 Davé says.Tim Cogshell, a critic for FilmWeek on KPCC-FM, the NPR affiliate in Pasadena, California, thinks a lot about how yesterday\u0027s attitudes should be considered in today\u0027s environment. Part of his answer comes down to intent.\u0027Sometimes you have to peel the onion. And then one decides how to think about it, how to feel about it, where to put it in the canon,\u0027 Cogshell says.So while \u0027Birth of a Nation,\u0027 the groundbreaking 1915 film widely regarded as one of the most racist ever made, is viewed ever more harshly as the years pass, a misogynist bigot like Archie Bunker from \u0027All in the Family\u0027 presents a different story: Whether a successful portrayal or not, Cogshell says, it was intended to highlight a problem and get it discussed.The solutions suggest a general direction: Don\u0027t simply ban or eliminate or delete. Talk about stuff — whether formally, when it\u0027s presented to the public, or informally at home. And involving more voices in the production of today\u0027s popular culture — and the selection, curation and characterization of yesterday\u0027s — can make sense of this more than dismissing the issue as overreaction or scrubbing the leavings of less-enlightened eras.Let Molly Ringwald have the last word: \u0027Erasing history is a dangerous road when it comes to art — change is essential, but so, too, is remembering the past, in all of its transgression and barbarism, so that we may properly gauge how far we have come, and also how far we still need to go.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Pippa Middleton strolls streets ultra rich enclave St Barts","story":"Happy holidays: Pippa Middleton, 35, carries her baby Arthur on the Caribbean island of St Barts with her husband James Matthews, whom she married last year, following behind  He\u0027s found his papoose in life!

For reasons that remain unknown, he was without his rifle.           According to scientists, three of Canada’s 13 bear sub-populations are in decline, including West Hudson Bay. However, a new Nunavut government bear management plan cites TEK from Inuit communities that contradict this: they say none of the bear populations are shrinking, while nine are increasingThe bear pounced, and while his 12-year-old daughter desperately radioed for help, Aaron was mauled to death.His friend William Tiktaq, 32, told me: ‘That evening, I was in the party that recovered his body. I put a tarp on top of him in the boat, so the salt water wouldn’t get to him. He was badly mauled. There were bites everywhere. It’s not a sight you want to see.’Six months later Aaron’s death, the first fatal attack by a polar bear in the Hudson Bay area for 19 years, is still a raw and emotional wound, described with sadness and horror by everyone I met. Its impact was intensified by a second mauling in August, when a mother bear and a cub attacked a group of three Inuit hunters near Naujaat, 500 miles to the north, killing Darryl Kaunak.‘These deaths have been a blow to the whole community – all of us are in shock,’ Evelyn Qasuk, 43, a mother of four children, told me. ‘It makes me nervous about my kids walking around outside the house.       A wild year! 2018 was the ‘most remarkable’ in decades for...A new Beast from the East could be on the way: Met Office...Share this articleThis year, the sea froze around Arviat unusually early: the bay was covered by mid-October. But Ikhakik says: ‘I saw bears out on the ice, hunting for seals one day – and then at the dump round here the next.’ This may be the key to their survival. The Inuit say they have seen bears catching Arctic char, the large local fish, while swimming in open water, and even seals. There is also food on land – including the tern eggs.‘South of Arviat there is a lot of geese, for miles and miles – one big food source for bears,’ says Kidlapik. ‘They are very smart animals. As the seasons change, bears change their habits, just like people do.’Moreover, the Inuit say the bears’ status as climate change pin-ups helps explain why they have lost their fear of humans.Churchill, in Manitoba, 200 miles to the south, is the world’s most accessible polar bear viewing spot. Served by jets from Winnipeg, it has become the focus of a lucrative bear tourist industry, with ‘tundra buggies’ taking thousands of visitors annually to see the ‘threatened’ bears. Sometimes, they are even allowed to touch them through steel fences. Many in Arviat are marked with green or purple paint spots, which means they have migrated from Churchill.Joe Savikataaq, the Nunavut territory premier and its environment minister, happens to live in Arviat. ‘Polar bear tourism is contributing to our problem,’ he said. ‘Because the media and other organisations are convinced there will soon be no more bears because of climate change, these are the most studied bears in the world. Yet traditional Inuit knowledge says they are becoming more numerous and more aggressive.’One solution, he has said, may be to increase the quota of permitted kills – which at present, for the West Hudson Bay, is just 28. This, a demand being voiced by several Inuit communities, would be controversial: ‘The government of Nunavut feels so much outside pressure because of climate change, when the world seems to think the bears are about to die out.’Drikus Gissing, director of Wildlife Management for Nunavut’s environment department for the past 14 years, said: ‘We have exceeded the humanbear tolerance level. It has become a public safety issue.           Mail on Sunday reporter David Rose in Hudson Bay, Canada. He wrote: \u0027Last week, Arviat’s minimum temperature hit minus 36C. However, as I rapidly discovered, its people – who are almost all Inuit – are as warm as its weather is brutal\u0027In other countries, they would be hunted. But people argue the Inuit should be willing to live with these animals. The communities are very upset. At every meeting we’ve been to this year, people said it’s not true they’re declining, they’re increasing, as at Arviat.’Gissing adds: ‘These bears are in good condition. Our biologists say they are doing fine. I’ve heard of reporters trying to film skinny bears and they can’t find them. You will always find skinny animals in any population. But when you look at the teeth of the bears that are skinny, they are usually very worn, from old age. That’s a good sign: it means the animals can die naturally.‘I don’t think that climate change is the main factor determining polar bear health and population size. I feel a lot of biologists are scared to say this because they are frightened of being labelled deniers.’Even Prof Derocher, who is convinced the bears’ long-term future is bleak, accepts that ‘the wheels are not coming off yet’, while ‘some bear populations are doing fine’.In West Hudson Bay, there has been ‘a recent period of stability’, he says, and though ‘we were seeing starving bears, starving cubs on land, that seems to have slowed down’. Then again, the computer models ‘are not great on the five to ten year time-frame’, and it was possible that, although the Arviat bears might look healthy now, they may be about to ‘fall off a cliff’.As my plane took off from Arviat just before ten in the morning, the sun was a pale red semi-circle piercing the icy horizon. A thought struck me.Climate computer models say sea ice will continue to decline. Yet polar bears have been around for some 400,000 years, some of them warmer than today: about 100,000 years ago birch trees grew on Baffin Island, and summer temperatures, scientists say, were 4C to 5C warmer than at present. Activists claim that polar bears are ‘the canary in the coalmine’ that proves how dangerous climate change is, not only to bears but humans. But what if they chose the wrong species? And if the scientists are wrong about the bears, will it be only the Inuit who become more sceptical?"},{"url":null,"title":"How volunteer army 300 000 open green spaces abandoned councils","story":"    Local residents have formed a voluntary group \u0027Friends of Ward End Park\u0027, pictured above\u0027It was appalling,\u0027 says Wajid Hussain, 50. \u0027This park is a real beauty and the best resource in our community and we saw it being totally abandoned.\u0027 Wajid, along with three others from a local community forum, spoke to police officers and went undercover for six weeks to work out the extent of the problem.They discovered that from Thursday to Sunday, there could be 150 men cruising the streets in cars or on foot looking for prostitutes.Between 20 and 30 male drug users would use the park benches.

Staff had been withdrawn and as a result anti-social behaviour had increased, creating a vicious circle with fewer people using it because it was not an attractive place.\u0027After setting up the Friends of Lordship Recreation Ground, he helped bring in millions of pounds in grants to spruce up the lake and paths, create nesting areas for ducks, and install picnic tables.Then overgrown trees and bushes were cut back, woodchip paths were laid, and glades for wild flowers were created. The park is now used by 900,000 people a year compared to 350,000 a decade ago.

And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.”That, in a nutshell, is what happens in Felice Benuzzi’s bonkers jailbreak yarn, No Picnic on Mount Kenya.

He writes for the  and is a regular contributor to the New York Review of Books. His latest book, Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain, is an excoriating cultural analysis of the political ideas behind Brexit.In your book, you criticise the way parallels have been made between Brexit and the 100 years war. What is the main problem?A single word: vassalage. What on earth is this word doing in political discourse in the 21st century? I was struck by its re-emergence. It comes originally from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, this mad idea that somehow the 100 years war shows the English capacity to throw off feudal vassalage. It’s a ludicrous misunderstanding of history. The war was more like Charles Taylor in Sierre Leone – a hideous crime against humanity. To go back to that as the only thing you have to express what English freedom might mean in the 21st century shows how demented it is.You also write about the long English tradition of clinging romantically to heroic defeat. What do you ascribe this to?George Orwell wrote about this in the early 1940s. He said that it was extraordinary that if you think about the poems that English schoolkids will know, they’re all about defeats or retreats or disasters. It’s Scott of the Antarctic, it’s the Charge of the Light Brigade, it’s Gordon of Khartoum. That tradition of heroic failure was great when you were ruling the world as it was a way of saying we’re not really a nasty imperial power. But in a post-imperial age you get a farcical version. Because originally the thing that characterised heroic failure in the English imagination was not self-pity, but Brexit is full of hysterical self-pity.You describe a false caricature of Germany, put about by Brexiters, of an expansionist nation. You also say that the EU, and especially Germany, had a need to severely punish debtor countries. Is Germany the glue that holds the EU together or a controlling villain?There’s no doubt that Germany is the major power in Europe, and that’s one of the things going on with Brexit. It’s this idea that this country we defeated twice in the 20th century is now seen as the dominant power. That leads to fantasies that Britain really lost the war and we’re being taken over insidiously by the Germans. The real problem with the Germans isn’t that they’re trying to take over Europe. It’s that they’ve promulgated a very heavy austerity that is deeply ingrained in the German mentality. The irony is, it’s exactly the policy that the Tory Brexiters themselves were pursuing.Some critics believe the EU is like the Hotel California. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave. Why did Ireland reject the treaty of Lisbon in 2008 and then accept it in 2009?It’s a real pity that David Cameron didn’t study the Irish referendums before calling one. Because what happens in referendums is that it’s a Yes, No and people vote on a whole set of generalised feelings about their own country, about their own particular situations. They’re sorts of tests of public mood rather than about the substance. What happened with Ireland is we said, did we really think through the consequences? Let’s talk about this, then see how the people feel. And in the second referendum more people turned out. The weird thing in the Brexit mentality is that June 2016 was this sacred moment of history that can never ever be revisited. If you can’t have second thoughts, you don’t have democracy.What’s going to happen now?I’m increasingly convinced that there will be a second referendum. The Sherlock Holmes principle is always a good one: you eliminate the impossible and whatever remains, however improbable, must be the solution. The second referendum has always been highly improbable but everything else is looking impossible. There’s just no deal that the Europeans can do that can get through the House of Commons. And no deal is so catastrophic that you have to hope that no sane parliament would allow it. So the one thing left is a second referendum.What books are on your bedside table?I’m catching up with Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick, which I probably should have read years ago. And also a wonderful book by a woman called Emilie Pine, called Notes to Self, a series of personal essays beautifully written. The other thing is by Derek Mahon, who’s 77 and had given up writing poems, and he’s down in West Cork and he’s just published a book called Against the Clock, which is about dying but also about climate change. And it’s absolutely wonderful.What’s the last really great book you read?Actually the last really great book I read was Jonathan Sumption’s extraordinary history of The Hundred Years War. It’s utterly riveting. So far, four hefty volumes and you just wish it wouldn’t ever end.Which classic novel did you read recently for the first time?Believe it or not, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Everybody’s talking about it as being very prescient in all sorts of ways. You’ve got the two dystopias, 1984 and then Brave New World. People say we’re more like BNW in this soporific culture, where we’ve given up all striving and are being managed, but I still think there’s some 1984 going on as well.Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read?Robert Musil’s The Man Without Qualities. I’ve tried about five times. The problem is with me. It’s obviously a great book, but I just get bogged down.Which book would you give to a young person?Best thing that happened to me when I was young was that my father told me that everyone had read the complete works of Shakespeare by the time they were 14. It was life-transforming for me. I wrote a book some years ago called Shakespeare Is Hard, But So Is Life, which was aimed at young people. You can be enormously enriched by artistic experiences that you’re not fully capable of intellectually processing.Which book or author do you always return to?At the moment I return to Samuel Beckett, particular his later work. He’s such a giant in theatre and fiction, and those late Beckett pieces are like nothing else in the world. It’s like an imagination at the end of its tether. People find Beckett bleak, but at the moment he’s incredibly consoling for his lack of self-pity. You carry on, you keep the imagination alive and you keep trying to make something beautiful out of things, however bleak they may be. I find that almost religious. I gave up on religion a very long time ago, but there’s something in those Beckett texts that actually has that force of meaning and consolation to us.• Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain by Fintan O’Toole is published by Head of Zeus (£11.99).

I informed you and informed you. I mean for the longest time ever since primary school I’ve been warning you to kill out that habit you insist on and that I now suspect you’re addicted to – that reading in public as you’re walking about.” Such behaviour, the speaker continues, is unnerving, disturbing, deviant, much to the bemusement of the errant flâneuse, who wonders why it’s acceptable for a terrorist to promenade with Semtex, but beyond the pale for her to do the same with Jane Eyre.The characters are from Milkman, the novel by Anna Burns that scooped this year’s Man Booker prize and lobbed a rock into the literary millpond: a winner who included the local food bank in her book’s acknowledgements, who went on the news and announced she’d be declaring “one hell of a change in circumstances” to the Department for Work and Pensions, and who turned the recent history of the Troubles into a compelling narrative that spoke to repression and segregation everywhere. Her victory was, as one  writer pointed out, a beacon of hope for those suffering from “shit life syndrome”.But it was also a spectacularly fitting novel to rise to prominence in a year when words and how they are used – or misused – became such a vital component of our understanding of politics and the rights and obligations of citizenhood. And although we may feel that the spirit of the times is more accurately embodied by Jeremiah than Pollyanna, there are good reasons to feel that in 2018, authors stepped up to the plate and showed how the written word could actively engage with a turbulent world.Naturally, that took place most overtly in the sphere of politics and society, from one of the year’s earliest must-haves, Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, through a plethora of books about Westminster’s spinning wheels to books that combined personal experience with structural analysis, such as Darren McGarvey’s Orwell prize-winning Poverty Safari. In the end, it is the latter variety that may well endure the longest, because 2018 was filled with writers desperately trying to keep up with the rapidity of events you might say it was the year of the hastily assembled appendix.And that crossover between memoir and reportage reflected another of the zeitgeist’s pressing concerns that of providing a space for people to bear witness. In the arena of the celebrity autobiography, more usually distinguished by a standard rags-to-riches journey smattered with titbits from the lives of the famous, there was a clear turn towards gravity, particularly reflective of the arrival of #MeToo and #TimesUp Rose McGowan’s Brave began the year and Melanie Brown’s Brutally Honest ended it, with contributions from singer Lily Allen and actor Sally Field in between.Female empowerment was, unsurprisingly in the year that commemorated the centenary of the right of some women to vote, all around: in Diane Atkinson’s exhaustively researched and impassioned Rise Up Women!, news journalist Cathy Newman’s Bloody Brilliant Women and Jenni Murray’s A History of the World in 21 Women, among many others. And in calls to arms such as Deborah Frances-White’s The Guilty Feminist, a development of the comedian’s hit podcast, or Scarlett Curtis’s anthology Feminists Don’t Wear Pink. Curtis’s book received a somewhat unorthodox boost when a display promoting it in a branch of Topshop was dismantled, apparently having incurred the displeasure of Philip Green, only minutes after it had been assembled. One might say that Curtis and her contributors had the last laugh.For the last few years, conversations about the publishing world’s resistance to change and inclusion have intensified and, more recently, prompted the sense that gestures towards future improvement were fast running out of credibility. But 2018 might have gone some way towards suggesting that change is happening, albeit more slowly than many would like. Nikesh Shukla, who was behind 2016’s bestselling essay collection The Good Immigrant, rolled out two significant companion projects, in partnership with agent Julia Kingsford: the Good Journal, a quarterly magazine showcasing writers of colour and other under-represented authors and the Good Agency, providing links between creators and publishers. Both enterprises were successfully crowdfunded, bearing out their founders’ belief that there is a market hitherto untapped by mainstream publishing.But even in established publishing, the ripples have started – both through the success of inidual books, such as Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené’s Slay in Your Lane, and in the creation of new editorial strands, like Sharmaine Lovegrove’s Dialogue Books, which sits as part of Little, Brown UK and the extensive Hachette empire. The imprint published four books in 2018, including the Prix Goncourt winner The Old Slave and the Mastiff by Patrick Chamoiseau a further 11 are on the horizon and Lovegrove has just been named the industry’s FutureBook person of the year.Meanwhile, Stormzy has launched his own list as part of Penguin Random House UK adopting a less is more approach, #Merky will introduce “a new generation of voices” in two or three books a year. And Kit de Waal successfully crowdfunded an anthology of working-class writers, Common People, out next year from publisher Unbound. But with all these green shoots appearing, it’s dispiriting that, in 2018’s final days, we discovered that England, Wales and Scotland had almost 130 fewer public libraries than in the last year.Over in the world of fiction, the belaboured question of literary fiction versus genre – who gets the prizes, who shifts the units, who is better at meeting the needs of the apparently undifferentiated “reading public” – rumbled on. This year’s false dichotomy came in the shape of the playfully named “Up Lit”, exemplified by 2017’s mammoth-selling Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, whose story of its solitary protagonist’s adventures in the outside world continued to engage readers throughout 2018, winning the Costa first novel award in January and the readers’ book of the year at last month’s Books Are My Bag awards. Also heartening was the background of its author, Gail Honeyman, who didn’t start writing in earnest until she was in her 40s, and whose break came when she won a competition for unpublished writers.In a year in which the Nobel prize in literature was not awarded after allegations of financial irregularities and sexual misconduct led the Swedish Academy to take a year off to recover the confidence of its public, there was something of a free-for-all aspect to prize-giving. The gap left by the Nobel was filled by an alternative Stockholm-based jury, the New Academy, who awarded the gong to Guadeloupean novelist Maryse Condé. Elsewhere, the inaugural Staunch prize committed itself to rewarding a thriller in which no female character was “beaten, stalked, sexually exploited, raped or murdered”, and was duly awarded to Jock Serong’s On the Java Ridge.Both awards provoked their fair share of controversy, but it was the Man Booker that most noisily prompted a debate about whether “serious” novels are inherently boring, depressing, difficult (see much of the reaction to Milkman), too narrow to attract readers in quantity (ditto and disproved, with impressive sales figures) and likely to make any reading experience something to be endured, not enjoyed. Such ponderings also inflect discussions elsewhere, as with the noticeable uptick in sales of audiobooks: if you listen to a book rather than stare at the marks on a page, is it really getting into your brain? If you savour one of the year’s page-to-screen adaptations – the brilliant Patrick Melrose, for instance, or the clever, fiendish Killing Eve – have you somehow cheated?The answer to which is, of course not. Readers of, or listeners to, fiction, like those who relish different kinds of music, films, television programmes and food, are perfectly capable of being productively promiscuous in their tastes. What is needed, perhaps, is a ceasefire, during which time we can reflect on the joy of range and register. That the Man Booker also included two “genre” books on its longlist, Nick Drnaso’s graphic novel Sabrina and Belinda Bauer’s thriller Snap, might have helped.The boundaries of this year’s notable fiction blurred in another way, too, with two intricate and experimental works of “autofiction” reaching their climax. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos completed the trilogy – about a writer of fiction called Faye, whose life bears a strong resemblance to the novelist’s own – that began with Outline and Transit. At the rather chunkier end of the scale, the English translation of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s six-volume My Struggle, which had no truck with changing names or many other signifying details, finally reached the end, which the literal-minded Norwegian celebrated by titling his final dispatch The End.But other novels played even faster and more loosely with reality. Olivia Laing’s Crudo at once foregrounded its own relation to the present moment by taking place over a few weeks, the length of time its author spent writing it at the same time, it ventured into more abstract and ludic territory by channelling the spirit of the late avant-garde novelist Kathy Acker. Crudo summoned the terror of watching the world spiral out of control – Trump and the far right rising to power as climate change goes unaddressed – with the personal challenges of marriage and self‑determination.Its apprehension of the gravity of humanity’s situation took a very specific form, quite different from the one employed by, say, Richard Powers, who examined the threat of environmental catastrophe via multiple characters and hundreds of pages in The Overstory. Closer to home, the first Brexit novels began to appear: most notably Jonathan Coe’s Middle England, which revivified the cast of The Rotters’ Club and The Closed Circle, and Sam Byers’s Perfidious Albion, a satire likened by reviewer Anthony Cummins to “an episode of Black Mirror as scripted by a ‘woke’ Martin Amis”, which, one might assume, will either make you rush to the bookshop or in the direction of a reassuring chunk of Up Lit.In Ireland, the surge of exceptional young writers showed no signs of abating. Most prominent is Sally Rooney, whose second novel, Normal People, elicited a whirl of approbation with its acute ear for the lives of its romantic pairing, and has been shortlisted for the Costa novel award. But the distinguishing feature of the Irish trend is the sheer number of talented writers that are being published alongside Rooney stand authors such as Anakana Schofield, Emilie Pine, June Caldwell and Danny Denton, to name but a few. And Rooney herself is committed to rooting out new voices via the editorship of literary magazine the Stinging Fly.Elsewhere, novelists’ interest in the classical world remains just as strong, this year bringing us Pat Barker’s The Silence of the Girls, a retelling of The Iliad from the perspective of Briseis, given as a spoil of war to the conquering hero Achilles. Barker’s narrative struck a chord with readers who know that there’s always more than one side to any story. In a similar vein, Madeline Miller’s Circe, Daisy Johnson’s Everything Under and Michael Hughes’s Country all sought to shed light on our fractured present by returning to the mythology of our fractious past.Novels about books, writing and the literary life are often subject to a particular kind of scorn, and viewed suspiciously – and sometimes accurately – as though they are excuse-magnets for pretension and self-importance. But we must, surely, make an exception for the searing portrait of the creative life provided by Paul Ewen. Drunken, impecunious and never far from a restraining order, Francis Plug, Ewen’s terrifying narrator, returned this year to describe his adventures as a writer in residence at a London university perhaps the most attractive part of his new appointment was that he could move out of his rat-ridden garage and surreptitiously stow away in the nooks and crannies of academe.Despite his florid misbehaviour, many writers may feel a sympathetic kinship with Plug, especially these lines:Being an author isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Most emerging writers, like myself, need a second trade, unless they’re inheritors of significant wealth. Even established mid-list authors are struggling these days, competing against the latest literary trend or “hit”. Books may be perceived as important in England, home of Eliot, Austen, Shakespeare and Dickens, but as the author of one, I don’t feel all that special.One wonders what Plug might make of the psychologist Jordan Peterson, whose deadpan expression, fondness for interpreting human behaviour through the lens of the lobster, and commitment to subsisting entirely on meat, catapulted him to a certain sort of celebrity. Undoubtedly, Peterson’s credo of self-discipline, outlined in the January publication 12 Rules for Life, would not appeal to the beer-swilling and gin-guzzling Plug.But although Peterson demonstrated that notoriety is a powerful engine for sales of books and ticketed events, he had not a hope of eclipsing the impact made by Michelle Obama’s memoir, Becoming, which rocketed to the top of the bestseller lists when it was released in November. Around the same time, British fans sweated through the ordeal of trying to buy tickets to see the former first lady in conversation in London, dolefully revealing on their social media feeds their queuing positions, which appeared to reach the upper limits of discoverable prime numbers.Such high-profile books provide a welcome boost for booksellers, who are always looking for the next shelf-emptier. They must, then, have been delighted by another piece of pre-Christmas cheer – the announcement that Margaret Atwood is to write a sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale, the 1985 dystopian novel whose prescient vision has ushered it back into the bestseller lists of late. While it might be a moot point to say that things can only get better, it’s to be hoped at least that they refrain from getting any worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ea892ad58eb3941f9c3f6fe4bf1775f76a42b0b/0_52_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ca038d7024949a4b265ca9d250e78e0","title":"economic uncertainty gold bright prospect","story":"The safe haven that gold offers has pushed its price to a 15-month high of £1,010. The riskier FTSE All-Share, which covers all London-listed companies, has tumbled almost 600 points to 3596.Adrian Ash, director of research at the online gold market Bullion Vault, said: “If gold acts as a barometer of financial fears then it’s flashing red for 2019. From Brexit to China’s hard economic slowdown, investors face a range of risks and shocks in the year ahead.”The possibility of a long government shutdown in Washington can be added to a growing list of potential threats to the global financial system, including the overhang of property debts in China, growing frustration in the west with Moscow’s foreign policy, and Italy’s fragile banks.Some of the fear arises from the uncertainty created by developments that will come to a head in 2019, among them the British government’s failure to secure a parliamentary majority for its deal to leave the European Union.In cautionary remarks earlier this month, Jerome Powell, the US central bank chief, cited a no-deal Brexit as a major potential shock to financial markets. And while he was certain New York’s banks could cope, he said it would be a focus of attention for them and him in the weeks leading up to 29 March.Trump has spent the year tweeting his fury with Powell’s approach, which he argues starves US companies of cheap money to invest and undermines the effect of last year’s package of tax cuts.But, as the Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has argued, most of the tax cuts were saved by the rich people and companies they benefited, and the small boost they gave the US economy has largely run out of steam. Investment spending in the US has begun to decline and the jobs market has peaked.Debt is also praying on the minds of traders. Not so much the personal debt that triggered the 2008 financial crash, but the huge rise in corporate and government debt in recent years.The US government must refinance about $1tn of debt in 2019 and the same again in 2020. It is a lot of money for the markets to find and the consequences are unknown. Corporations have also borrowed heavily and must roll over large sums next year into new financing deals. Tobias Adrian, director of the monetary and capital markets department at the International Monetary Fund, also said recently that “the sheer size” of the shadow banking sector – that is, unregulated non-bank lenders – was very different from years past, “and we don’t quite know how that is going to behave in a downturn”.Without the US and Chinese economies galloping along, Europe has taken a tumble. Germany’s economy shrank in the third quarter along with the Italian economy. The Spanish parliament is locked in a budget battle it cannot resolve, while Brussels has clashed with the Italian government for proposing a budget that would breach EU rules on state borrowing.No wonder the OECD thinktank says the pace of global growth will slow next year. It blames protectionist import tariffs imposed on China by Trump for a slackening of investment. It has warned that world economic activity could be weaker in the years ahead if the US and China impose further penalties on each other’s goods.However, some analysts suggest things may not be as bad as they seem. Chris Bailey, a strategist at the stockbroker Raymond James, said Beijing was likely to comply with enough of Trump’s demands on trade to smooth over the dispute with Washington.“The Chinese have liberalised, they’ve set up for more discussions in January. It’s not going to be a straight road but I think there’s a little bit of cause for optimism there,” he said.Bailey also said any fall in the dollar, making borrowing in the US currency cheaper, would allow many indebted developing-world economies to chart a way through the slowdown.“It sounds increasingly contrarian, but my feeling is that, particularly if we get the transmission mechanism of a lower dollar, stocks outside the US are set up for a good 2019,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79eae04c20cb073702c0dafacf25deda2ef5d5b/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f2b6569049b3619e79c7e5d50a3a9e","title":"parliament brexit second referendum eu deal","story":"Parliament is deadlocked. The Brexit tin can that has been kicked down the road since June 2016 is now lodged firmly in the machinery of Westminster, bringing parliament to a grinding halt. MPs cannot now agree on how we might get parliament and government working again.The prime minister has delivered a plan for Brexit that she feels is the best our country can achieve, given the government’s red lines. I have no doubt that she is sincere in this. But this doesn’t create a majority in the House of Commons for it. Quite the opposite: any rational examination exposes the deal’s flaws when compared with either the reality of the status quo or how far short it falls of the leave campaign promises in 2016.The Labour position is even more questionable. When the opposition front bench is able to agree on what it wants, it usually focuses on wishing to retain customs union access, with a voice at the table in Brussels – both unacceptable to our European neighbours, and not in practice possible legally.I believe that it is important, now more than ever, that members of parliament engage in rational arguments, not in reiterating undeliverable wishlists. Thankfully, roads have opened that could lead us out of this Brexit crisis. One obvious solution, which is fast gaining support, is to hand the issue back to the country. I would add that we also need formally to take no deal Brexit off the table, because that way lies chaos and disaster.Both of these would help to calm a crisis that is only set to grow, unless parliament can assert itself and decide on a way forward. Work is being done by all sides to understand how we might find our way through the current crisis, and the campaign group Best for Britain has set out four ways to secure a people’s vote in its recent publication Roads Not Yet Explored: Routes to a Final Say, to which I have contributed a foreword.Brexiteers tell us (and hope) there simply isn’t time to have another referendum before article 50 expires at the end of March 2019. But this is simply not the case. The EU will give us the time if we want it. So long as there is political will to deliver a solution to the current impasse, there is a course of action available to us that means we will be able to check whether or not the will of the people has changed over time. To call this a subversion of democracy is utterly wrong. We will not be thanked by anyone for dragging the country out of the EU on a deal for which the public have shown no enthusiasm. For MPs that would be an abdication of responsibility.Parliament voted for the public to decide the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union. We should now ask the people whether the prime minister’s deal satisfies their hopes and demands, and if it does not, offer a viable alternative. Our country needs a rational outcome and, judging from the current situation, parliament is not capable of delivering it. We need to open the road for the people to finish, one way or another, the task they started in June 2016. Whatever the result, parliament must abide by it.• Dominic Grieve is Conservative MP for Beaconsfield and a former attorney general"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9621124bbce59be1e4b0090bb6820516d86e834/0_109_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6560f4471e1b58762ca6806f9d78f365","title":"2019 a grim year in prospect cartoon","story":"Brexit, Trump, Putin… but the biggest threat to our future is climate change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/888fe802dbc6511e6d1a0a3e070cc476a875d194/0_67_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7929642eebeab1fae5745717cc65b854","title":"exam reforms boost private pupils in race for universities","story":"Tough tests are forced on state schools as data reveals benefit to independent sectorTory education reforms are giving private school pupils a huge additional advantage in the hunt for university places and jobs by allowing them to sit easier GCSEs than the more rigorous exams that are being forced upon state schools, new official figures suggest.Data released in parliamentary answers, and research into the exams chosen by private schools, shows the extent to which the independent sector is still opting for less demanding, internationally-recognised GCSEs (IGCSEs), which state schools are progressively being barred from using.Last night the Labour MP Lucy Powell, a former shadow education secretary, who received the data after tabling a parliamentary question, said it was now clear that reforms of the GCSE system had put state school pupils at a disadvantage compared with their private school counterparts.“State school pupils have been treated like guinea pigs while many independent schools have gamed the system, insulating their institutions and their pupils against these changes, keeping the easier international GCSEs completely, or waiting for the new GCSEs to bed in before opting to enter their pupils on to these courses,” she said.The Department for Education says that in the year in which a reformed GCSE subject is first examined, the equivalent IGCSE subject will be removed from Key Stage 4 performance tables, effectively meaning that state schools cannot use them.A DoE spokesperson admitted that the new exams were tougher than the ones being widely used in private schools. “International GCSEs have not been through the same regulatory approval and quality control as the new gold-standard GCSEs, which is why we no longer recognise international GCSEs in school performance tables. The new GCSE qualifications have been reformed to provide more rigorous content, so young people are taught the knowledge and skills they need for future study and employment.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said private schools were within their rights to choose the internationally recognised exams, which include coursework, and should not be blamed – but added that the system was incoherent.“This issue highlights the mess the government has made of the qualification system. It’s only a few years ago that Michael Gove was encouraging headteachers to introduce IGCSEs into their schools because it was seen as a better qualification than the GCSE,” he said.“This was followed by hasty rewriting of GCSEs, stripping coursework out of most of them, and placing huge amounts of emphasis on final examination papers. Now the government has removed most IGCSEs from school performance tables, which effectively means state school pupils can no longer take these qualifications.“Year 11 pupils typically sit more than 30 hours of examinations in the new GCSE system, and we are very concerned about the impact on their mental health and wellbeing.”Analysis by Powell’s office of GCSEs on offer at top independent schools shows that none of the highest-performing schools puts their pupils in for the full suite of the tough new GCSEs in EBacc subjects. These core areas, which the government thinks it is important for young people to study to GCSE level, include English language and literature, maths, the sciences, geography or history and a language.Pupils at £40,668-per year Eton College were only entered into IGCSEs in EBacc subjects.Pupils at schools including the £37,296-per year boarding school Sevenoaks School and £17,040-per year Abbey School in Reading were only entered for IGCSEs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e98c56daac18649d5d4dfa90a55964ef7ed7f6d5/0_0_3840_5760/master/3840.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=69e32f79de7cc7793e20a0612c6f6dfd 1440w","title":"jurgen klopp liverpool nine points ahead manchester city","story":"Jürgen Klopp said he would prefer to deliver his verdict on Liverpool’s first half of the season after the game against Arsenal, and following another handsome win that took his side nine points clear he was true to his word.“Nothing to moan about at all,” was the manager’s summary of 20 games unbeaten in the Premier League, even if he did go on to say Liverpool can still play better. “It is not every day you beat Arsenal 5-1 but there were times in the game when we could have played better, and there were certainly times when we could have defended better,” Klopp said.A subdued Unai Emery said Arsenal needed to be better defensively, possibly the understatement of the weekend, though he did admit his side had been overrun in midfield. “We lost the balance,” the Arsenal manager said, after confirming Mesut Özil missed the game because of a knee injury. “We started well but when Liverpool began to push us they did so with great determination.”Liverpool have put themselves into a tremendous position at the halfway stage of the season, though Klopp becomes irritated at any mention of the size of their lead or their status as apparent title favourites. “I am not the smartest person in the world but I am not an idiot either,” he said. “It does not matter how many points you are ahead in December. We might be nine points in front now but we have to go to Manchester City in five days. Talking about how many points you are in front at this stage is a game for supporters and journalists. We cannot play that game and we don’t.“When the Tottenham result came through before kick-off there were plenty of people laughing and celebrating but I can tell you that in our dressing room there was absolutely no reaction. No smile on the face, nothing, because we were all absolutely concentrated. We could not avoid knowing the score from the earlier match because it was everywhere on screens and people were talking about it, but I think we showed in our performance that we did not allow it to influence our game.“We are running a marathon and this is halfway. Our first target is to qualify for the Champions League and I don’t feel we have done enough to be sure of that yet. All that matters is to be ready for the next challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278d44540ecbd4acd9c1f54cfe5ebf76878390a6/55_118_2753_1652/master/2753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63dd43959b057ebe64891de621c944fc","title":"liverpool arsenal premier league match report","story":"It seems Pep Guardiola might be wrong about Liverpool feeling the pressure now they are out in front in the Premier League – all the slip-ups and chokes are currently coming from the teams immediately below them, with the leaders sailing serenely on.Jürgen Klopp’s team were almost untouchable here, taking advantage of Tottenham’s unexpected collapse at Wembley to open up an impressive nine-point gap at the top of the table. Klopp insists it is too early to talk about titles and leads, though if his side are still unbeaten after their visit to the Etihad on Thursday it is hard to imagine who or what might derail the most powerful assault on the Premier League Liverpool have ever mounted.Arsenal gave it a shot, even inducing a mild frisson of tension by taking an early lead, but well before the end they were worn down by a relentless red machine. This was not Liverpool at their most flamboyant – it did not need to be. A combination of efficiency and boundless enthusiasm was enough to force Arsenal into errors, from which clinical finishing ensured the goals flowed.Liverpool predictably swarmed all over Arsenal from the start, with the front three pressing frenziedly and Fabinho and Andy Robertson driving through midfield to set up attacks, yet it was the visitors who struck first. Alex Iwobi had already seen a shot saved from the first real attack of the evening, before a misdirected pass by Dejan Lovren gave him the ball on halfway a minute later. Iwobi played a quick one-two with Aaron Ramsey and headed for the Liverpool area, this time crossing instead of shooting for Ainsley Maitland-Niles to supply a neat finish at the far post. Alisson might have reacted earlier and tried to get something on the cross, but he was probably expecting another shot and the speed with which Arsenal sent men forward took the entire Liverpool backline by surprise.Unai Emery’s players must have felt pretty pleased with themselves after a torrid opening period, yet Liverpool snapped back in under three minutes. Mohamed Salah’s shot inadvertently set up Roberto Firmino to equalise, and though Arsenal appealed for offside the referee’s assistant correctly ruled that the last touches had come off Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi, who had found only each other when attempting to clear. If that was a statement of intent from Liverpool another arrived almost immediately, Firmino popping up with his second after Sadio Mané dispossessed Lucas Torreira in midfield. That description does scant justice to the quality of Firmino’s contribution: the Brazilian glided effortlessly past attempts to challenge from Mustafi and Papastathopoulos before placing the ball calmly beyond a nonplussed Bernd Leno. It was one man against virtually the entire Arsenal defence and Firmino won hands down.After three goals in little over five minutes the game settled down for a while, with Liverpool always in control, before Mané increased the lead just past the half hour. Arsenal cleared a corner but had so many men back in their own box the ball ran to an unchallenged Robertson on halfway. The full-back had all the time he needed to hit a 50-yard diagonal pass that picked out Salah in the area, and once the Egyptian had squared across goal Mané finished with an emphatic flourish even though the ball came to him at waist height.Just when Arsenal thought they might make it to the interval without further damage, after seeing attempts of their own from Maitland-Niles and Ramsey fly narrowly over in the closing minutes of the first half, a momentary lapse of concentration cost them dearly as stoppage time arrived. Firmino found space on the right and picked out Salah in the area, who then reached the goal-line ready to cut back across goal. The situation was already dangerous and a rash challenge from the luckless Papastathopoulos did nothing to improve it. The defender did not do too much to bring Salah down, a point he was still arguing with the Liverpool striker as the teams headed for the tunnel at half-time, but he had his hands on his opponent and his attempt at a tackle from behind did not reach the ball. Salah went down, the penalty decision went his way and he scored from the spot to secure a 4-1 interval lead.Liverpool could have gone further ahead at the start of the second half but for a careless touch from Salah, showing too much of the ball to Leno and wasting a quite wonderful pass into the area by Xherdan Shaqiri. Arsenal did not give up and came quite close to finding the net when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang lifted a shot over the bar from a yard or two out. It would not have counted – the flag was raised – but replays suggested Aubameyang had managed to stay onside to reach Ramsey’s cross.Leno had to make a save from Fabinho after a clever flick from Salah set up another chance, so Arsenal could not complain too much about another soft penalty bringing a fifth Liverpool goal. Sead Kolasinac shoved Lovren in the back as a cross from Jordan Henderson came in, Michael Oliver spotted it and awarded the spot-kick from which Firmino completed his hat-trick.Perhaps Lovren went to ground too easily, but the push gave him that option. Liverpool will arrive at Manchester City with 54 points from 20 games, 48 goals scored and just eight conceded. That’s championship form in anyone’s book. The pressure is now on Pep."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b8fc54bbfe56cc14540e356b692381b276b83d/55_82_2116_1270/master/2116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b04c60453c4fa0fc7d2fd86e4ef62eae","title":"mauricio pochettino tottenham wolves","story":"Mauricio Pochettino accused his players of complacency after Tottenham’s stunning late collapse against Wolves dealt their title hopes a major blow.Tottenham were poised to continue their winning run after taking an early lead through Harry Kane, who would later be booked for ing, but Pochettino’s side fell nine points behind Liverpool after succumbing to an inspired comeback from Wolves at Wembley. Pochettino was unhappy with how his team responded in the second half, admitting they made the mistake of thinking the game was over when they led 1-0.“The game was under control in the first half,” Tottenham’s manager said. “I think maybe it was easier than we expected to dominate. They played so deep, chasing us, we didn’t concede one chance. But in the second half we started to feel maybe the game was over, and when you feel the game is over you start to decide the wrong way, start to play too many long balls and then it was difficult to recover the balls.“We played more with the heart rather than with the head and we started to spend a lot of energy, and of course you need the energy in the end. I am very disappointed, like the players, but there is nothing to say. Now we need to move on and be sure we are ready for the next game.”Pochettino dismissed suggestions this defeat will heighten the impression that Spurs lack the bottle to win the league. Yet the Argentinian did question his team’s consistency after Wolves moved up to seventh place thanks to goals from Willy Boly, Raúl Jiménez and Hélder Costa.“You need to play 95 minutes your best. Like today, we dropped a little bit our energy and focus, and in the last 20 minutes we conceded three goals. It can happen to us, it can happen to Wolves, to Liverpool, to Manchester City. That’s why it’s so tough to win the Premier League because you need to be consistent. And today it’s a clear example if you are not consistent enough, with not only good quality during the game but the right energy, it’s difficult to compete for these things.”Pochettino said Spurs struggled to cope after Boly’s equaliser. “We miss that freshness to kill the game. Different things could have happened with Everton or Bournemouth but I think, for me, we killed the games and then we managed the game. Today I think the moment we concede the first goal the team was down and it was difficult to find the energy to win the game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here are your stories and picturesAfter a classic London renting situation, where my partner and I had to live with a leak just above the bed for a month, we finally got the savings together to get a shoebox of our own. No leaks yet, thankfully. It was on the first or second day, while we were eating on the floor over a sheet (with a bit of wine in tumblers), and were laughing and looking out of the window, surrounded by an endless pile of boxes and bags, that I felt a sense of calm I had never experienced before.Lying on my swing seat in my garden, the sun shining and a gentle breeze through the leaves of the birch tree above me. My swing seat was the best purchase I ever made: I’m on holiday whenever I sit on it. Whatever my mood, it answers to it, whether I’m happy or sad, elated or exhausted, with friends or on my own, for breakfast, dinner, lunch or tea. It is the best thing.In the middle of a small barn, in May 2012 at the end of 48 hours of lambing, while sitting on a low hay bale the only human in a barn full of sheep. I am no farmer, and in that barn I was no more than a nursery maid. Sheep mums being mums and lambs being lambs. The nursery had a rhythm: when the skipping and eating stopped, there was a calm that absorbed me. At that moment, life was good, and I was a part of it. I was one of the flock.Social media has some great benefits, but it can easily become mentally and emotionally burdensome. So, when we went to Havana in Cuba we made the decision to stay in a casa particular, essentially a private home, that had no access to the internet, a phone signal or any of the other trappings of modern life. For two days, in a small farming town called Viñales, we truly switched off. In the months since, I have deleted my Facebook account, closed email accounts and use my phone only for keeping in contact with close family and friends.In the minute after my second daughter’s head had crowned. The midwives were chatting, laughing and taking care of everything. It would soon be just me and my baby, in a secluded newborn ward, where I could just breathe and see the changing light through the window. No criticisms, no complaints, no office politics, no prioritising other people’s moods, no factoring in bills to pay, no existing for others. Only this most real thing that we were still doing together. This was the start of our conversation, the one that will continue all our lives.Sitting on Pentire Head, near Polzeath, north Cornwall, on a sunny October day in 2013. Tucked out of the wind, feeling the sun on my face and listening to the waves crashing against the cliffs below. The sea was almost turquoise and I felt a moment of complete calm all was well with the world.In July 2016, I tagged along for a day on my friend Ralph’s fishing boat, hauling lobster and crab pots for him around the Eastern Isles of the Isles of Scilly. The best bit was halfway through the day, when we were sitting there on the water in the sun, a mile out to sea, eating our cheese and pickle sandwiches, drinking a flask of tea, and lobbing the crusts and the odd bit of crab bait to curious fulmars that had joined us. Marvellous.An afternoon in hospital in Montélimar in 2009, after having had all four wisdom teeth removed. They had been growing horizontally and should have come out when I was a teen. One day, at 40 years old, with my first ever real toothache, I was told by a dentist that they had to come out straight away. I was waking up from the anaesthetic and staring out of the window at the intense blue sky, watching huge clouds of steam floating up from the nearby nuclear power station. I am self-employed with two children, and moments like that are incredibly rare. For once, I was without a care in the world.I had been having relationship difficulties for some years, and one day snuck away to visit my daughter at university. It was the first time in a long time that I felt free. I didn’t have to watch what I said or did, as I knew my daughter loved me unconditionally. Every minute was precious: we talked, laughed, ate out, shopped and hugged. That day was my first taste of what our life could be if I had the courage to leave, which eventually I did.My first ever wild swim as an adult was September 2012 in a tarn in North Yorkshire, hunting for a friend’s lost mobile phone. However, I didn’t embrace the joys of intentional outdoor swimming until October 2017, and I’ve been addicted ever since. The impact of the water meant I could think of nothing else but what was happening to my body: the numbing of the fingers, the sense of needing to gulp air but attempting to slow myself down to regulate my breathing. The sense of foreboding that I woke up with that morning has gradually faded, and has been replaced with a sense of wonder at immersing myself in the elements.September 2016, lying on a sunlounger at night on the terrace of a hotel on a hill outside Fiskardo, Cephalonia, with my husband, Richard. Every night, we would sit there and look at the beautiful sky, with no light pollution, and watch the shooting stars. We did this for an hour, chatting or sometimes just staying silent. Sadly, Richard died suddenly from a heart attack the following April. Perhaps understandably, I haven’t felt as relaxed since as I did on that holiday.It was a bright, clear day in September in a sleepy part of northern France, and I had stopped with my family at a lake. The water was gloriously cold, and I felt alive. Treading water, I turned to look at my family on the empty beach, waving and laughing at me, and I felt absolute contentment at being somewhere so beautiful with the people I love most in the world. The sunlight created an almost perfect reflection of the surrounding arc of trees and I realised that I was miraculously happy.Being off-grid with no phone, no people, no food, books or noise (other than the occasional breeze and a few flies) in Rub’ al-Khali – AKA the Empty Quarter – one of the most beautiful, harsh and huge deserts in the world. Every year, I get dropped off deep in the desert and stay alone for three days, with enough water and shade to survive, and without any expectations on me or my time. There is no experience like it that has this level of silence and peace.Walking the Camino de Santiago in September to mark the end of four years of study. Two girlfriends and I walked the Camino Inglés, and the freedom from anything else other than the walk each day was incredibly liberating. Every morning, we convened at 8am, had breakfast and set off, walking steadily to our destination, pausing occasionally to take in different sights and appreciate the landscape as it unfolded before us. The feeling of release from our cares was amazing, and we are already planning our next walk, along the Portuguese coastal path.I recently started an oil-painting course. The first week was landscapes, and I spent three chilly hours in a field painting the view. It was the most relaxed and carefree I had felt in a long, long time. My painting was pretty dreadful, but it didn’t matter: I had tried something new and felt proud of myself.In October, I went on a school trip to the Turkish resort of Kusadasi. After a long day of studying, my friends and I were free for the night and went swimming together. Maybe it was the lack of adult supervision, the scent of the sea or the general comfort I had from being with my friends that made me feel so relaxed. We were as free as a bunch of 16-year-olds on a school trip could be, which isn’t much, but at least I felt as if I could do what I wanted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f113a078ce61129dddb0defd7692d7d6ca54e947/0_119_3344_2006/master/3344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ab8d845eae7db72782fb9244308de5","title":"alice cooper i want my shows to take you as far away as possible from politics ","story":"The musician, 70, on avoiding politics, cheating at golf and having understanding parentsThe first thing I ever remember was my mother changing me at a bus stop.

My family had no problem with rock’n’roll. My parents were actually champion jitterbuggers in their day. It was the lifestyle they were concerned about. The drugs. The sleeping around.

They wore their best outfits: hand-embroidered silk saris, Bollywood-style beehives, bright pink lipstick – looking like minor film stars. They were, after all, travelling to England, a place of dreams, a mythical country of prestige and opportunity. They had read in books that the houses were colourful and the streets so clean you could almost eat your food off them. The women were my two aunts – Apa and Bhaiti, nervous new brides, who had left small-town India for the first time. They were about to join their older brother and his new wife – their childhood best friend, my mother, Tripti.The three women had grown up on the same narrow road, in 1950s West Bengal. The daughters of strict Brahmin families, they prayed every morning, were given classical singing and dance lessons, and played in the jungles of their semi-rural neighbourhood. My mother describes it now as a lost, dream-like world, full of adventure and freedom. On hot humid days, they would roam and climb trees, picking mangos, guavas, coconuts. They would cool down by jumping into the ponds, swimming and floating on giant fallen banana leaves for hours.Their families were devout upper-caste Hindus. My mother and her sisters would get up at five every morning to clean and prepare the family prayer room, picking flowers and praying to stone idols of Shiva and Narayan. A few doors down the road, my aunts and my father lived in an even more intensely religious household. There were elaborate rules on how to prepare food: it was strictly vegetarian – no meat, fish, eggs, or even onion and garlic. There was daily ritual bathing, and my grandmother spent hours every day meditating and reading from the Bhagavad Gita.But this was post-independence India, and society was changing. My mother and my aunts were allowed to go to college, and a flicker of ambition was lit. Bhaiti worked hard at school, got the best exam results in her district and studied medicine Apa did an MA in social work, while my mother studied chemistry. She dreamed of being a headteacher or a scientist. “I wasn’t interested in getting married,” she told me recently. “I wanted to do so many things, go here and there, be political.” But by their late teens they were no longer allowed to roam freely: my aunts had chaperones to take them to college, and all three girls were expected to have arranged marriages to Brahmin men.It was from this constricted life of caste privilege that they suddenly found themselves on their way to England. My mother and Apa finished college and their marriages were quickly arranged, to men who had decided to settle in Britain – the fabled “mother country”, a modern and civilised place to study, work and achieve great things. Bhaiti had, defiantly, fallen in love with a non-Brahmin. She and her new husband decided to move to Britain, too, hoping she could find work as a doctor and live a freer life, away from the disapproval of her family.The two sisters, now in their 70s, remember how their fragile optimism faltered as they arrived at Heathrow. Apa looked out of the plane window and saw the pillow-like clouds, the dazzling white sun, but was shocked when they landed. Under the clouds, the sky was an endless blank grey, while the sooty houses all looked the same and there was a perpetual drizzle. “I thought, ‘What a place!’” The huge impersonal airport, the sea of unfamiliar white faces, was unnerving. They realised how much their lives had changed.My aunts came to live with us in Southall, west London that winter, in the little semi-detached, pebble-dashed house my father had bought for £500. They remember watching TV in the living room, trying to keep warm, wearing saris with woollen long johns underneath. It was the only room with a fire. Apa laughs, remembering how they would all look at one another if the phone rang, hoping someone else would answer it in the freezing cold hallway.My mother had also recently arrived and hadn’t realised how isolated she would feel. “I felt like a baby, I couldn’t even buy bread. I am an educated woman and suddenly I didn’t know the language – it was as if I was ignorant and begging the whole time.” When her best friends joined her, she had, for the first time, a little community. “The first Christmas we had together was beautiful. We tried to cook like English people. We did a roast and I stuffed it with rice! We got a tree and we even had Christmas pudding – we really enjoyed it.” My Dad took them to Oxford Street for the January sales, where they bought a set of red Bakelite chairs – three for £5 – which survive to this day.But outside the house, it could be a hostile world. My aunts had landed soon after Enoch Powell’s Rivers Of Blood speech they saw people on TV complaining about the influx of immigrants. In Southall, Asian children were bussed out of the area to different schools, after protests by local parents. My mother remembers going out in her sari and being stared at, with men sometimes barging into her. “I felt afraid whenever I saw the young men, in large boots, with their heads shaved,” she says. A Bengali friend was dragged from a car and punched others were routinely threatened with violence. Bhaiti recalls being spat at by men from a passing bus.But they were resilient, and things slowly started to improve. My mother navigated an impersonal world of suburban job centres and 1960s light industry on the edges of the capital: at Bellamy Knitwear doing a technician’s job at the huge Metal Box factory in north Acton. It was a postwar industrial world by the Grand Union canal that has since vanished. She worked hard, cooked and cleaned every day, and went to night school to study chemistry again, as employers wouldn’t recognise her Indian qualification. She eventually got a job as a lab technician at Brunel University, where she worked for 23 years.Bhaiti remembers writing endless job applications. Ads often asked for “British-born” candidates only Bhaiti realised that as an Indian doctor she would never get a job in the south she managed to find work in hospitals in the north instead – places that were friendlier, places she came to love. But after several years, she returned to London to be near her extended family again.As I write this, I am looking through photos of my mother and aunts in those early days, and they look beautiful: smiling young women with their lives ahead of them. I feel it’s been a bittersweet journey for all three, since that winter of 1968. They built good lives, got jobs, and made lasting friendships with the English people around them. They had opportunities they would never have enjoyed in India – and have remained close all their lives. I grew up with my funny, charismatic aunts and all my cousins, spending every weekend, all the holidays, within a huge close-knit family.But there’s a sadness, too: when my mother and aunts visit India, their old neighbourhood seems unfamiliar and unsettling. The ponds have been blocked up and the jungles around their old houses cleared to make way for flats. They no longer know most of the people who live there and the way of life they grew up with has disappeared. They spent their lives far from their parents they couldn’t be with them when they died. In gaining their freedom, they lost their homeland. “India” as my mother puts it, “is not mine any more”.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1068302ecca74c936bb82b037aaea61d92b075f4/0_145_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de5c36ed170f55555aa55ad20a577a8","title":"craft works we both make things important our home reflects that","story":"Salvaged wood and friends’ art make this old malthouse a warm family homeWirksworth has always been a place where people make things,” says Esther Patterson. The Derbyshire market town is where Richard Arkwright opened the world’s first steam-powered mill. During the 1800s they churned out actual red tape for Whitehall. In the 21st century production workers have been replaced by craftspeople and factories have been turned into studios for the ceramicists, metalworkers and designers… People like Patterson, who give Wirksworth its Bohemian edge.“This is a friendly place, too,” she says, whose business, Curiousa \u0026amp Curiousa, specialises in colourful, contemporary lighting made by hand in the town. “It can take me 20 minutes to walk down our street, because there’s always someone to chat to.” Patterson’s home, which she shares with her husband Paul Carr and two grown-up children, feels equally sociable. In the 19th century, the red brick building was a malthouse, filled with pungent piles of grain fermenting for beer. The couple have preserved its industrial, open-plan architecture, adding rugs, art and bright wallpapers so that it feels like a cross between an urban loft and a country house.“We moved here from a townhouse with a small sitting room, so we wanted to have a big, communal space where the family could all meet,” says Carr, a graphic designer. They ided the long rectangular space. Glazed screens separate bedrooms at either end in the middle, the convivial sitting room flows towards the kitchen, bright with hanging plants, and the dining area, where new doors lead to a terrace.“Both of us love making things, so it was important that our home reflected that,” says Patterson. In the kitchen they covered one wall in Venetian plaster to contrast with the gleaming oven hood, made by layering copper leaf over an inexpensive extractor. The shelving came from an old mill and the cabinetry was salvaged from a school science lab, with metalwork forged by a local blacksmith.Unpainted brick walls provide a backdrop for art by friends: ceramics by Anna Collette Hunt and paintings by Pat Shenstone, Isabel Pugh Cordero and Ian Groom. “We’ll do swaps for my lighting. It’s a very symbiotic arrangement,” says Patterson. The striking mural in the dining room is by her son Gabriel, its brightness offset by the monochromatic painting by Ben Lowe. A rustic chair is by Full Grown, a company which trains trees into the shape of furniture. Fellow Derbyshire designers Blackpop produced the painterly fabrics, which revived the mid-century seating.In the bedroom, Patterson painted the emerald chinoiserie wallpaper. “My mother is a painter and I had a creative upbringing, filled with gardening, craft and painting. I enjoy trying out different things,” she says. Patterson’s glass lights, which cascade from beams like otherworldly planets, are handblown so that no two shapes are alike. “Designs pop into my head and I’ll sketch them in my notebook. Going for a walk, photographing leaves or flowers can be the start of a new piece. I’ll often design something for myself and it’ll become part of the collection.” For her latest pieces, Patterson took inspiration from her garden to create the silk lanterns, which add exoticism to the sitting room.Patterson’s lights also bring colour to the ground floor. “We’d planned to turn it into a studio, but it’s a dark, difficult space.” So this community-minded duo formed a plan. “Wirksworth lost its cinema in 1967. We’d been running open-air cinema events, so we knew there was demand for one here,” she says. To raise funds, they sold a plot of land that they owned and, with a flurry of last-minute donations, opened Northern Light, an independent cinema. “It was a huge undertaking, but if you’re in the arts, you have to take risks.” It feels like an extension of their home. “It’s a place for locals to meet and have a drink,” says Patterson, tweaking a popcorn display. Friends sanded the salvaged seating, painted walls and hung the vintage mirrors, which reflect Patterson’s lights.Patterson made her first pieces when she was studying decorative arts at Nottingham Trent University. “I went as a mature student in 2006. It was a brilliant three years experimenting with woodwork, ceramics, printing.” A chance encounter inspired her to start Curiousa. “I’d been making lamps out of slipcast bone china. One day a glass blower visited the college. I asked him to blow one of my table lamps. It took him one afternoon – mine had taken six months. That was my Eureka moment.”Graduating with a first-class degree, she shoehorned her furniture and wallpaper designs into a stand at the London Design Fair where her trailblazing lights scooped an Elle Decoration award. “No one was doing contemporary coloured lights, so we stood out.” Liberty placed an order. Harvey Nichols, the Royal Albert Hall and Jamie Oliver (who has Curiousa lights in his kitchen) followed suit.From a workshop in a caravan, the business has grown to include a staff of nine with a showroom in London. A new range of waterproof lights has been introduced for bathrooms, and Patterson hopes to put her hand-painted wallpapers into production soon, too. The glass is blown in Derbyshire the lights assembled in the factory, which once made red tape. “I can’t imagine making our pieces anywhere else,” she says. “I’d feel as if I’d lost a bit of my soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/458d4af1d3491a7880b55f6026cfc1b3b6b535d4/0_295_7087_4252/master/7087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c19928f3a8af5546440bdcbb8d1cdd02","title":"high society a minimalist chalet in the alps","story":"This chalet in the Italian Alps is almost Japanese in its minimalism: all understated calm and breathtaking viewsThe interior of this three-bedroom apartment may be the height of cosy, understated luxe, but it’s the views that count: snow-covered peaks, dense pine forests and a picturesque mountain village all nestled in a valley 1,400m above sea level. La Thuile sits at the extreme west of Italy’s Valle d’Aosta, close to the border with France and Switzerland, part of a vast ski area known as Espace San Bernardo.Across two floors, the apartment is almost entirely clad in aged larch, the wood a rose-pink tone. It is simply furnished, with mostly unadorned walls and bulb pendant lights the odd metallic table, brass lamp, fur throw and colourful textile prevent it feeling entirely spartan. On the ground floor is an open-plan living and dining area, complete with wood burner a small kitchen and a guest bedroom and bathroom hidden behind an almost invisible door. In the centre, a black iron staircase spirals up to the first floor through a hole in the ceiling, resembling a fireman’s pole with steps. Here, under the eaves, are the master bedroom, a children’s room, and a bathroom, the shower clad in local stone. There is no clutter, excess furniture or trimmings: in the master bedroom, nooks built into the cladding serve as bedside tables even the kitchen cabinets have wide holes rather than handles.The building references a baita, a traditional hut found in the western Alps, says the architect Francesca Marchetti. “They are made from stone and wood, with steep roofs covered in stone slabs. And they have balconies, to take in the air and the views.” The interior, she adds, has a simplicity “that renders it almost Japanese”.For the owner, it’s somewhere he can “disconnect”, ski and walk – an hour door-to-door from his weekday home in Geneva, a calm oasis among the mountains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b26b7224d9408a8ccfc3af070ca9d011f0e1c4/2302_476_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6aea47e346434bd0239e67d76b7619","title":"how to quieten your mind exercises","story":"Taking even 10 minutes a day to focus on yourself can have an incredibly positive effectEvery day we’re faced with stresses that challenge us, leaving our minds busy and frazzled. Taking even 10 minutes a day to focus on yourself allows the mind time to quieten. Here are a few tips to get started.Just stop Find a quiet space where you won’t be disturbed and can let your mind settle. Stopping allows your brain momentary respite. This will immediately reduce distress. Use a tapping technique (a slow, alternate, rhythmic tapping on the thighs or upper arms). With your eyes closed, while tapping, visualise a space or place that represents peace and relaxation – a beach, or a particular room or garden. Take some time to go to this space, really noticing the colours, smells and sounds. Observe your stress level dropping. Bring your mind’s focus to your breath Breathe in for four seconds, then out for four, repeating for eight rounds. Notice how tension gradually releases from your body and the noise in your mind reduces. Observe your thoughts rather than engaging with them. Watch them come and go like clouds in the sky. Notice how incredibly soothing this can be.These interventions will help deactivate stress activity in the brain and quieten the mind. Practising them daily will strengthen your brain, improve mental flexibility and change unhelpful patterns. It may well be the most important 10 minutes of your day.• Owen O’Kane works in mental health services in the NHS.

It is also understood that cabinet ministers have discussed the option of a delay with senior backbench MPs in both the main parties and that Downing Street is considering scenarios in which a delay might have to be requested from Brussels.One senior Tory backbencher said: “I have had these discussions with ministers. They will not say so in public but of course the option of a delay has to be looked at in detail now. If we are determined to avoid a no deal, and the prime minister’s deal fails, we will have to ask to stop the clock, and that will give time for us to decide to go whatever way we decide thereafter.”The Conservative MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he believed that even if May got her deal through, there would probably be insufficient time to push all the necessary legislation through parliament to allow Brexit to happen smoothly and that a delay might well be necessary. But if her deal were voted down, the need to take up the option of a delay would become a “certainty”. He said: “I think that if she does not get her deal passed, a delay would be inevitable to give more time to avoid a no deal, and also there is the possibility that there would be a referendum, so this would allow for that.”Labour’s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said that parliament would need to discuss all options, including a possible delay, if and when May failed to get her blueprint through the Commons. “If the prime minister’s deal is voted down in early January, then we will be just nine weeks away from the date we are due to leave the EU,” Starmer said.“If the deal is rejected, parliament will need to have a very serious debate about how to protect the economy from a no-deal scenario and at this stage nothing should be ruled out.”Any attempt to push back Brexit would anger hardline Brexiters in the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. But most MPs think it would be supported by a majority in parliament to avoid a cliff-edge exit.In the week before Christmas Starmer told the Commons: “I do agree that serious consideration needs to be given to the timetable now set by article 50, because by 14 January we will be just nine weeks away from the proposed date of leaving the EU. On any view, the government will then have to make a choice about what to do next. No plan B has ever been forthcoming.”Brussels has made clear that it would consider putting back the date of Brexit for a good reason, but has stressed that this could not mean reopening negotiations. The EU would be willing to allow extra time for a second referendum to take place.Cross-party groups of MPs have been considering how to force a delay, if the government does not decide to ask for one itself. One idea is that it could be done by tabling an amendment to a Brexit-related motion that would be put forward by ministers if no deal were agreed by 21 January.The Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is campaigning for a second referendum said: “The stark reality is that the principal way of stopping no deal – which is a distinct possibility – is by getting an extension of the article 50 process. The EU is clear – they will grant an extension to allow for a people’s vote, not for further negotiation, so committing to a people’s vote is the way to stop no deal.”Labour is not, yet, officially calling for a delay but is biding its time to see what happens when parliament returns in the second week in January.Meanwhile figures have emerged showing the government has spent more than £4m on consultants to help prepare for leaving the bloc. This includes almost £1.5m on Boston Consulting Group, which in 2016 warned that “a protracted period of uncertainty and volatility seems very likely on many dimensions, including on growth, trade, investment, interest rates, and financial markets”.Susan Elan Jones, a Labour MP and people’s vote supporter, said: “The only people who benefit from the government’s Brexit plan are management consultants and accountants. It’s a bad deal for Britain and a much worse deal than we’ve already got in the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a69c1cfd7c83297f3634a896618724d7dccfe941/0_266_4664_2799/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cbc20ef065408ab19fb12811512eda1","title":"town of culture letter to jeremy wright yvette cooper labour mps","story":"Group led by Yvette Cooper sends open letter to culture minister Jeremy WrightWe are writing to urge you to establish a new town of culture award to run alongside the UK city of culture, and to celebrate and boost arts, culture, investment and jobs in towns across the country.As you know, the city of culture is not just a title, but a huge opportunity.The UK city of culture award has served as a catalyst for social and economic regeneration in the cities that have been awarded with the title, and shortlisted cities have similarly benefited from the bidding process which publicises the best of local culture.As the 2017 city of culture, Hull attracted over £220m in investment, created 800 new jobs, opened 131 new businesses and attracted millions of tourists. The city of culture helped to boost the local economy and to foster an immense feeling of pride among residents.While towns are not exempt from applying for the city of culture title, only one town has made the shortlist previously, and small towns are simply not equipped to contend against major cities in a bidding process that is resource-intensive. That disqualifies huge parts of the country that are rich with cultural history and heritage.Instead of having to compete with big cities once every four years, or lose out completely, we believe there should be a distinctive town of culture award convened by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport every year.From the proms at Pontefract Castle, to the Batley and Spen Youth Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford upon Avon, to the iconic old Adelphi cinema in Slough, the Turner gallery in Margate, the restoration of Auckland Castle and the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury festival, towns and smaller communities across the country can be great showcases for culture and creativity.A town of culture award would generate new investment, footfall and national recognition for the towns involved, and it would provide the opportunity for communities to be creative, ambitious and to celebrate the best of their local area. A year-long programme of cultural activities and events would help to regenerate local areas and high streets, create new jobs and bring communities together.But perhaps most important of all, the award process would mean national funding organisations, such as the Arts Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund, or private sector organisations would be required to focus particularly on towns.We are therefore calling on the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to establish an annual town of culture prize and to promote increased arts and culture investment in our towns in order to offer our towns the same transformative opportunities as our cities.We hope that you can not only agree but work with devolved administrations to make this a nationwide initiative.We are requesting a meeting with you to discuss this further.Yvette Cooper MP, Normanton, Pontefract and CastlefordTracy Brabin MP, Batley and SpenLiz McInnes MP, Heywood and MiddletonChris Matheson MP, City of ChesterGed Killen MP, Rutherglen and Hamilton West"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db8233cf115b685ba55f87c45d2125c206c2e11d/0_369_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fd12c0d77ddef3e86b3fc8cc329f894","title":"get fit without busting gut","story":"Is it boom time for the fitness business? One in seven people in the UK is believed to be a member of a gym, 2018 saw the number of gyms exceed 7,000 for the first time, and by 2022 the private health and fitness club market alone is predicted to be worth a whopping £3.9bn. Such is the demand for workout spaces that the Financial Times wondered: “Is gym the new pub?”But other stats suggest that we’ve never been so idle. A 2017 survey from Kantar Public found that more than a third of the UK population never exercise, with the Department of Health estimating that such inactivity costs the economy around £8.2bn each year through treatment costs for lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, and the indirect costs of sickness absence at work. And a recent study by the World Health Organisation found that little progress had been made in improving physical activity levels in the UK between 2001 and 2016.While many of us start with good intentions, various surveys suggest that a substantial number of those gym memberships go largely unused, with many of us citing lack of time, or tiredness after work, as the major hurdles. It is perhaps telling that some of the most popular fitness trends on the market are regimes like CrossFit and Tabata, intense workout programmes that promise high gains in the shortest possible time, often a matter of minutes.Rather than emphasising targets, governing bodies are increasingly adopting an “anything is better than nothing” mantra so much so that in the past decade, increased amounts of funding and research have been devoted to understanding the minimum amount of exercise we can get away with in order to maintain optimum health.So what does science tell us?For many years, the official recommendations from Public Health England and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US have stated that we need at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week – which roughly equates to about five park runs – and at least two sets of strengthening activities, on all of the major muscle groups.These numbers are based on intensive statistical analysis of more than 40 years of research. Scientists define the “150 minute” mark as the average amount of time where the majority of people will see benefits in everything from cholesterol levels to body fat percentage, sleep quality, mental health, bone density, and even holding back the ageing process.“We did a study where we took skin biopsies, and in people who exercised regularly we found that the skin looked 20 years younger,” says Mark Tarnopolsky, professor of paediatrics and medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “And when we took sedentary older adults, and trained them for three months with this amount of exercise, there was a youthening of the skin by about 20 years.”Scientists agree that 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity cardio has consistently been shown to extend life by an average of three to four years, as well as a reduction in incidence of everything from cardiovascular disease to depression, and most cancers.“All the recent data we have on exercise suggests a lot of powerful things with respect to diseases being minimised,” says Jinger Gottschall, associate professor of kinesiology at Penn State University, Pennsylvania. “It’s really motivating to see what can be achieved, but the sad thing is, so many people don’t do it.”To try to make exercise more palatable, scientists have been investigating ways to get the same physiological benefits in much shorter periods of time. When it comes to cardio, one way to do this appears to be upping the intensity, as is the case with Tabata and other high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programmes.“There’s good evidence that if you increase the intensity, workouts which involve just a few minutes of exercise in total can still be extremely effective,” says Martin Gibala, professor of kinesiology at McMaster University, Ontario, and one of the scientists who has pioneered research in this area. Scientists think this is because the body registers that it is losing a lot of energy, and so provides more stimulation to key molecular signalling pathways involved in everything from maintaining muscle health to regulating blood-sugar levels. This can happen after 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or far shorter periods of vigorous exercise.The most extreme end of this is something dubbed the “one-minute workout”, a form of HIIT. In total, it involves three 20-second bursts of all-out exertion, with one to two minutes of recovery in between, a three-minute warm-up, and a two-minute cool-down at the end.However, HIIT has not been without its controversies. Other scientists have found cases of a rare condition called rhabdomyolysis among HIIT newcomers unaccustomed to the intense strain of these workouts. This occurs when intracellular muscle constituents break down in an uncontrollable fashion and leak into the bloodstream, causing pain and potentially leading to kidney damage if ignored.Wary of this, governing bodies are holding back on officially advocating these regimes to the public until more data is available on who is and isn’t suitable for HIIT training, and whether it can be done safely over the course of years and decades without risking injuries.The latest Public Health England guidelines have still tried to embrace higher-intensity exercise, but with a more cautionary approach. They suggest a minimum of 75 minutes of exercise per week at a vigorous intensity: not as full-on as HIIT, but a brisk enough jog or cycle for you not to be able to speak in full sentences while exercising – and as the recommended alternative to 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise.“This means you could do three 25-minute cardio workouts a week and you’re meeting the minimum health requirements,” Gottschall says. “That’s still much more feasible for people.”While more intense workouts can cut the amount of weekly time we need to spend on cardio, the same doesn’t apply for other categories of exercise, such as strength training and stretching.In fact, while pumping iron may be typically associated with young bodybuilders, working on muscle strength and flexibility through sets of weight training or yoga sessions actually becomes more important as we age.“As you get older, you’re naturally losing connections between the nerves and the muscles, leading to weakness, and eventually lack of independence, and increased risk of falling,” Gottschall says. “But studies have shown that strength training such as cycling on an exercise bike with a high resistance can help negate this, and even improve other things, such as bone density.”In fact, Tarnopolsky believes that the minimum amount of exercise we need to do to stay healthy increases with age, especially past 50, to the extent where we should try to do some kind of muscle-strengthening activity every day, and an hour of stretching a week.“Keeping all the balls in the air does take a lot more time as you get older,” he says. “Just doing cardio alone doesn’t help with strength, which is continuously declining throughout middle and old age. Flexibility is more important to work on as you get older, because there’s increased collagen deposition in muscle, which makes you feel stiffer so stretching keeps your joints healthy.”While this may sound impractical to some, Tarnopolsky points out that time restrictions are often less of an issue when you’re older. “You have more time to fit these things in, especially once you’re retired,” he says. “And the key thing is, you can always improve what you have. We’ve done many studies with strength training which show that the body does respond, even with people in their 80s who have never done it before in their life.”There’s also growing evidence that the minimum exercise requirements each of us has to stay healthy is very inidual, something that depends as much on our genes as our age.Of course, a regime would need to be tailored to the person’s condition and inidual requirements. Those at risk of sarcopenia would probably need to devote more minutes to strength training, while type 2 diabetics are thought to require both more cardio and more weights than the rest of us.“Blood sugar is greatly impacted by daily bouts of physical activity, so a type 2 diabetic really should be doing cardio every day,” says Gary Liguori, professor of health sciences at the University of Rhode Island. “Blood sugar is absorbed by the muscles, so strength training has benefits too, because if you can increase muscle surface area, that allows it to clear so much more sugar from the blood.”Persuading people to do even more exercise for their particular health condition, when so few even hit the minimum requirements, may seem a stretch, but Tarnopolsky says this simply shows that our perspectives on exercise need to change.“We have to start thinking of exercise as a drug,” he says. “Therefore, if you have a strong family history, which indicates a genetic risk factor, or something happens which proves you have that disease, you should make the time. Even if you exercised for half an hour every single day for seven days a week, that’s a tiny fraction of 16 waking hours. And after all, time doesn’t really matter when you’re dead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61eef8b005debe61338979257e78f323a573dec1/0_668_4770_2862/master/4770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db85d920d301ca49ef81238d32081794","title":"haiti midwives save new generation","story":"The country has the highest maternal death rate in the Americas. But there’s a new solution: putting care in the hands of midwivesSylvie Delice was born on a hot, slow March afternoon in a clinic in Marigot, a coastal town in south Haiti. The labour was seven hours her mother, Natalie, 24, a seamstress, was stoic throughout, helped by two midwives in pale pink scrubs. Sylvie arrived strong and healthy, and was named after her mother’s cousin. Natalie recovered well and went home the next day. There was nothing unusual about Sylvie’s birth – yet it was far from typical.Many of these deaths are caused by events that occur during, or shortly after, delivery. A mother may haemorrhage. She or her baby may suffer an infection. Some babies can’t take their first breath without help newborns, particularly those who are tiny, can quickly become cold, making them weak and less able to breastfeed. Simple, life-saving treatment has been available for decades in income-rich countries. But not in Haiti.But Haiti is working on a solution: the country is training a new generation of midwives, working in dedicated birth centres. This is radically transforming the prospects for mothers and babies even in the most hard-to-reach areas, and turning birth into an exhilarating rather than deadly experience.Marigot’s Centre de Santé, where Sylvie Delice was delivered, is 60 miles south of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Set on the seafront, among hibiscuses and lime trees, the clinic serves a rural population of around 25,000 who live in the town and the surrounding lush forests and thatched hut villages. Women in labour arrive in tuk-tuks or sitting side-saddle on the back of motorbikes.“The midwives make you feel safe, because you have someone watching over you,” Natalie says when we speak the morning after Sylvie’s birth. She is married to a fisherman, and they live in Raymond les Bains, a village farther along the coast. “I wasn’t scared about the labour,” she says. With her son, now two, she had an epic labour – five days – and was able to stay at the clinic throughout. “The midwives did not send me away,” she says. “They were very patient.” Visitors can stay overnight, and Natalie was supported by her cousin and a neighbour. “They held the baby at night so I could sleep,” Natalie says. “They brought me food: meat and plantain.”Staffed by two midwives and an auxiliary nurse, and funded by the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), it provides antenatal and maternity care, all free of charge. Most healthcare in Haiti is paid for, with the average cost of a first antenatal visit ranging from $6 to $25. The clinic also offers family-planning services and post-abortion care. Abortion is illegal in Haiti, and complications from unsafe terminations are another cause of maternal mortality.“Women are well taken care of, and that is very rare in this area,” Roche says. The oldest of three children born to a single mother who worked in a shop, Roche started her career as a nurse, inspired by her grandmother who worked as a hospital assistant. “She gave me real equipment to play with,” she says. “I used to practise giving injections to the lizards on my bedroom wall. My sister and aunt are both nurses. I come from a family where all the women are nurses.” After studying nursing in Port-au-Prince, she worked for 18 months in a hospital in Marchand-Dessalines, in the northern region of Artibonite.She was at the hospital in 2010 when one of the deadliest earthquakes in history levelled Port-au-Prince and much of southern Haiti, killing more than 220,000 people. As the shock waves surged through the country, the hospital started shaking, even though it was more than 130km from the epicentre. “At first, I thought it was a bulldozer or truck going by,” Roche says. “I only realised it was an earthquake when I saw one of the directors screaming, ‘Get out!’”But, actually, she says, it was the catastrophe that befell Haiti barely a year later that really changed her: the cholera epidemic that, to date, has killed around 10,000 people. It highlighted how ill-equipped Haiti was to deal with a public health emergency, and sharpened her resolve. “It was shocking,” Roche says. “In other countries, this would not have occurred. It made me want to teach women how to keep themselves clean, and how to protect themselves from disease.”This came at a time when Roche was becoming dissatisfied with nursing. “As a nurse, you have to run from gynaecology to cardiac to orthopaedic wards. As a midwife, you are doing a specific job with specific results.” It’s a job she describes as “beautiful, because you are really taking care of someone”. In 2011, Roche enrolled at National Midwifery School in Port-au-Prince and then, after various internships, joined the clinic in Marigot in 2013. She has since delivered well over 1,000 babies.Since 2013, the National Midwifery School has occupied a shiny new building, near Cité Soleil in Port-au-Prince. The previous building was devastated in the earthquake. Many student midwives would have been killed had lessons not finished less than an hour before it struck. When the rumbling started, some were at the nearby Lumière University, attending a lecture on obstetric care by Quettely Chevalier, then a teacher at the midwifery school and now its director. The students and Chevalier escaped unharmed.Chevalier’s “personal fight” is to lower the maternal mortality rate so it’s at least on a par with other countries in the Caribbean. “Why is it that so many women in my country have to die while giving life?” she asks. Outside the midwifery school, a group of students are sitting on steps reciting the causes of sexually transmitted diseases (having an STD during pregnancy can create potential complications for both mother and baby). They are dressed in a smart, grey uniform (“I want the midwives to stand out from other medical professionals,” Chevalier says). The atmosphere is jovial, enthusiastic.“I want to help women in difficulties,” says Edeline Pierre, 19, who has moved with her mother to Port-au-Prince from Pilate, an eight-hour drive away, so she can train to be a midwife. “I want to be informed, successful in life.” The school has 38 students in the first year, including two boys. Oliver, a former law student, switched to medicine and then midwifery to “do my bit for Haiti”.Before the earthquake, Haiti had around 350 midwives by 2013, fatalities and emigration had reduced that number to 211. However, the intake has doubled in recent years, thanks to a change in structure that makes it easier to retrain nurses in midwifery. The college also offers a three-year direct-entry course for school leavers. A recent report by the WHO estimates that at least 2,200 midwives are needed to significantly lower maternal deaths in Haiti. Chevalier remains hopeful that they will reach this target. “The plan is to open satellite midwifery schools to increase numbers,” she explains. “There is a long way to go, but still, things are improving.”Back at the Marigot clinic, Roche’s colleague, Pascal Darline, 30, also a former nurse, explains why she switched to midwifery five years ago. “I like the idea of helping a woman give life.” Darline grew up the second oldest of four in Grand Goâve, near Léogâne, in south-west Haiti, where her father is a soft drinks salesman and her mother a seamstress. She qualified as a midwife in 2013, working in a hospital in the Artibonite region. But the 90-minute commute from her home in Port-au-Prince was “too far, so when a job came up here, I applied,” she says. She has been here for a week. “The biggest challenge for me as a midwife is to watch a patient dying. It is very painful.” She says in each case it was a home birth. “It’s not that they don’t want to come into hospital it’s because they can’t afford it, or they can’t get there.”Haiti’s terrain is marked by high mountains and deep troughs. On the northern side is the Massif du Nord in the south-west, the Massif de la Hotte and Massif de la Selle. Over half of Haitians live in remote countryside. Chronic underfunding means there are few roads, little public transport and much of the country is inaccessible.Roche is single Darline married. They board together at the clinic (Darline’s husband lives in Port-au-Prince). Their official working day runs from 8am to 8pm, but the clinic is open 24 hours a day, and they help whenever required. They’ve seen and learned to deal with countless complications: twins babies whose umbilical cord is wrapped around their neck stuck shoulders.More complex cases requiring blood transfusions, say, or caesareans, are transferred to Saint-Michel hospital, a 45-minute drive away in Jacmel, or to Port-au-Prince. The ambulance, a 4x4, is parked outside. Darline has just sent a women who is eight months pregnant to Jacmel. “She is severely anaemic. Even if we gave her iron tablets, she would still need a blood transfusion.” Other patients include Marie Carline, 21, who is three months pregnant and suffering from severe morning sickness, and is lying in bed on a drip receiving much-needed fluids and Dionese Exil, 18, who is having a long and difficult labour with her first baby. She kneels and rocks, her voice exploding through the air: “Whoah, whoooah.” With each contraction, she grows louder, “O Lord! O Papa! Where are you!? The pain! God, I’m dying!” (Haitians subscribe to two religions: Catholicism and Voodoo.)Laurette, 36, a mother of two daughters, aged 18 and 14, is sitting in the outdoor waiting area in the clinic’s courtyard with several neighbours to support Exil. Laurette knows firsthand how birth and death are interlinked. Her cousin died of a haemorrhage a few hours after giving birth in 2007. And her baby son died when he was one month old in 2004. “He fell ill with a fever.” She says she would have gone to the hospital in Jacmel, but her only means of transport was her husband’s boat – he’s a fisherman – which had been seized by Dominican Republic authorities. “They said he was poaching.” Lokun died in her arms.Laurette and her friends eat a packed lunch of fish and fried plantains. “We love babies,” she says, sticking her head around the door of the labour room to cheer on Exil, who later gives birth to a boy in the hospital in Jacmel. Motherhood may be a dangerous experience in Haiti, but it is highly valued, even revered. “Being a mother gives you a lot of status, you are seen as someone important in the community,” says Moetsi Duchatellier, assistant representative, UNFPA, Haiti. “It’s better to be married and orce two or three weeks later than never to be married at all. The next level is to be married and have children. If you have a boy, you win it all.”“If you don’t have babies there is no possibility of change in your life,” says Myrtha Magloire, 26, who lives among almond and mango trees in the lush hills above the village of Peredo, a 20-minute drive from Marigot. Married to a gardener and over eight months pregnant with her second child (her son is eight), her belly strains out of her dress she is blooming. She chose the Centre de Santé, even though it is at least an hour away, because her local clinic only offered antenatal appointments from seven months. The midwives in Marigot see women monthly during the first and second trimester, then twice a month. Magloire explains why some women die in childbirth. “This happens when you have extreme complications or some voodoo. It can be a spell someone has put on the woman. For example, someone might not like the man you’re with, so it can be an act of jealousy.”“We have to work with traditional beliefs,” Darline says. “It’s all about education.”The midwives have created a safe sub-world in this poverty-stricken part of Haiti. But still, out of around 300 pregnant women currently registered, only 30 will deliver at the clinic. “You have to be really motivated, because getting here can be really difficult,” Roche says. Women who live in the village of Guillermond find it particularly hard. “They are separated by a river. There is no bridge. It takes at least an hour to walk down the river. The only option is a boat.”Iloyese Belizaire, 18, is Haitian-born but lives in Dominican Republic (Haiti’s neighbour to the east on the shared island of Hiiola) with her husband, who makes metal doors. She moved in with her mother in a village deep in the forest outside Marigot when she was eight months pregnant, specifically to give birth at the clinic. “I would have had to pay $7 and have a passport to deliver in Dominican Republic,” she says.When her waters broke two weeks earlier, two neighbours carried her through the warren of dirt paths to the road. Then she spent an hour riding in a tuk-tuk and got to the clinic just in time for her daughter to be born. She passed out during the delivery. The midwives revived her with smelling salts, and gave her juice and crackers. “My blood sugar levels had dropped,” she explains. “I am so grateful to Miss Roche – and to God for giving me someone to care for.” • Commenting on this piece?

Diamond had just completed his media duties when he approached Sam Peters and asked the journalist why he had not asked any questions. Then, in the tradition of the old school he values so highly, Diamond invited Peters outside for further discussion.Peters had written an article for the Independent highly critical of Diamond’s regime in September and this was the first occasion the two had crossed paths since. Peters took his recording device with him for the assignation, which Diamond snatched when outside. As Peters moved to get it back Diamond yelled at him to take his hands off him, precipitating a shouting match for around a minute during which Peters accused Diamond of being a bully.It was an incident symptomatic of Diamond’s hot-headedness, his very appetite for the fray as stirring as it is destructive. For the first time this season that mindset inspired a performance on the field of sufficient aggression and precision to take a league win away from Salford.If logic were anything to go by, this was an inexplicable result, but logic flew out the window long ago in this season’s Premiership. In winning at Gloucester, who were clear in third and playing to a packed and famously raucous house, the Sharks suddenly find themselves in the top six. Only a couple of rounds ago they were vying with Newcastle at the bottom. Such is this season’s bun fight, they could just as easily find themselves back down there as they could in the Premiership playoffs come the end of the season.Sale not only won away, they took the bonus point. There were fisticuffs from the start and off the field the usual fireworks from Diamond and his cohorts were loudly in evidence, their railing at the heavens morphing into celebration as the Sharks rode an early 10-point deficit to score 30 unanswered points.They can play a bit. Faf de Klerk is a livewire the Springboks, no less, are glad to call their own, and around him South African and North Englishman dovetail smoothly.Gloucester ran out to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter, Jaco Visagie finishing some smooth approach work. Then, in the second, Sale responded with 17 unanswered points. Chris Ashton finished smartly for Sale’s slick first try. Their second was a beauty, Ashton’s half-break developed by James O’Connor, who found De Klerk on his shoulder.A penalty on the stroke of half-time extended Sale’s lead before another stretched it to 10. That second came with a yellow card for Lewis Ludlow, four minutes after a yellow for De Klerk, who tapped down a Gloucester pass in a threatening position.Unlike Sale, Gloucester chose to send their penalty to the corner and messed it up. Already their game management was creaking.Sale took advantage. Having used their previous penalty wisely, they sent another to the corner and drove through Gloucester’s undermanned pack with ease for their third try.On the hour they had that bonus point. Jono Ross drove close and De Klerk whipped out a long pass to Denny Solomona to score in the corner. Gloucester hammered away for the rest of the final quarter, driving a lineout over in the dying minutes. No one was fooled. Gloucester have not yet put their troubles behind them.And Sale’s are sure to revisit them before this most competitive season is out. Indeed, with his little contretemps long after the last ball had been kicked, Diamond may just have triggered another unnecessary investigation into his controversial methods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92fcf3548a5146006e74e0a6cc965a06df6a7980/42_14_4579_2749/master/4579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797a90962dcf826db03d4321e5f81e73","title":"harlequins wasps premiership match report","story":"Harlequins defended for most of the match against their erstwhile neighbours, but outscored Wasps by two tries to one after showing a side to their game that matched their black jerseys. Their snarling, defiant attitude was personified by their hooker Dave Ward who was sent to the sin-bin 10 minutes in for stepping on the ankle of Thomas Young having previous had the flanker in a neck roll.There was also a suggestion that he spat at the Wales international, although it was not an allegation levelled by Wasps after the match. “I do not know if any spitting occurred and so I cannot comment on that,” said their director of rugby, David Young. “We saw the stamp and we do not need that sort of rubbish in the game which is hard enough without it. I thought we had gone past that.”The citing officer will have little spare time on Sunday. Towards the end, the referee, Craig Maxwell-Keys, told Charlie Mulchrone, Quins’ third captain of the day, to have a word with Joe Marler and inform him that a repeat of the verbal volley he aimed at the referee after being penalised at a scrum would result in a red card. Happy new year wishes were not on many minds.“Quins are like that,” said Young. “They are in your face with a lot of barracking. You must not take a backward step against them.” Wasps are going backwards, though, a fifth Premiership defeat in six matches plunging them into the bottom half and heading towards a relegation scrap for the first time since they were based at Adams Park and were within minutes of being wound up.They dominated here for the most part but only after going 10 points down. Quins scored the fastest try of the Premiership campaign through Alex Dombrandt, 49 seconds in after the flanker had exchanged passes with Ward following a lineout routine that fooled Wasps who, in a foretaste of what was to come, dropped the kick-off and Will Rowlands played the ball in an offside position.Not that long ago Wasps had the sharpest attacking game in the Premiership but Danny Cipriani has left for Gloucester, Jimmy Gopperth is out for the season, Christian Wade is trying to break into American football and Dan Robson has just returned from injury. They rarely vexed a well-drilled defence and Gopperth’s absence has made it harder for their New Zealand fly-half Lima Sopoaga to settle in.French clubs have discovered that signing an All Black is not guaranteed to pay off. They are products of their environment: Sopoaga was armed with fluidity and tricks, one pass out of the back of his hand freeing Bassett after a lineout, but he stood deep and often passed a long way behind him, making the gainline almost inaccessible against a resolute defence.Quins attempted twice as many tackles as Wasps and the one try they conceded, 17 minutes into the second half to cut their lead to three points, was from close range after they had bungled a scrum. What happened after that highlighted a difference between the sides: Quins were switched on and focused, Wasps cloudy and lacking an exemplar: Joe Launchbury was in line to play after recovering from a knee injury, but suffered a neck spasm.Discipline, handling and decision-making let down Wasps all match and no sooner were they back in it than Elliot Daly conceded a penalty for throwing the ball to the ground in frustration. Another penalty followed and Danny Care, after opting for a lineout rather than three points, let the defence rush up before chipping to the line for Joe Marchant to score.Sopoaga’s penalty 12 minutes from time gave Wasps a bonus point but it should have been more. They attacked to the end, making the same mistakes. Quins climbed to fourth and there was something military in the way they set themselves up, all spit and polish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/993d13f12dddfd4794dbb1d012ce3455c536aeae/0_67_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14853e46899ca94a66cde381ae9aec49","title":"india retain border gavaskar trophy after cleaning up australia on day five","story":"India have retained the Border-Gavaskar trophy with ease at the MCG, claiming a 137-run victory on day five of the third Test after rain provided more resistance than many of Australia’s batsmen.Virat Kohli’s team hold a 2-1 series lead and are perfectly placed to complete a breakthrough series win at the SCG, where the final Test starts on Thursday.India have lost all 11 previous Test series they’ve played in Australia, a barren stretch dating back to when they were crushed by Don Bradman’s side in 1948.But the tourists, having exposed Australia’s batting woes in clinical fashion throughout the MCG match, will be full of confidence after wrapping up victory at 1.17pm AEDT on Sunday.Morning showers meant day five didn’t start until 12.55pm but India required just 4.3 overs – 27 balls - on Sunday to claim the required two wickets.Pat Cummins was out edging to Jasprit Bumrah and Nathan Lyon was undone by an Ishant Sharma bouncer as Australia were rolled for 261 in pursuit of a venue-record target of 399.As India’s fans celebrated with gusto in the stands, Cummins declared his side were desperate to avoid an ignominious series loss.“We can go 2-all in Sydney.

The way Jasprit bowled in Perth it was criminal that he didn’t get the wickets but he won us the Test Match here.”“It is a bit disappointing no doubt I thought we made some strides forward in Perth but with an inexperienced betting performance you are going to have performances as we did in the first innings.”“You have got to put it into perspective we are playing against the best attack in the world at the moment and we have a really inexperienced top six.”We are always trying to get better and we have a huge Test coming up ahead of us in Sydney. There are always little discussions around batting orders and teams and it’ll be no different coming into the Sydney Test.”“You can be skilful as you like but Pat Cummins rolls his sleeves up every day and we’re looking forward to having a few others going with him.”“I think the silver lining is that we have in the next few months we have some world class players available coming back into our set up and we’ve been able to get some valuable time into some young batter. But we are under no illusions that we are going to have to work really hard to level this series then Sri Lanka is going to be a really big challenge for us.” The Indian fans are singing the national anthem. They have been quite superb. Virat Kohli is over there now giving his batting pads away to them as well. I want to see him get his full kit off like Shane Crawford did after his 200th game. Righto, to the presentations. Stand by.Pat Cummins speaks. “We probably didn’t absorb the pressure we well as India did,” he says. “We were probably only 100 runs away from putting up a really good show in the first innings and a session in the second from drawing the match. But they outplayed us.” On a personal level? “I’m pretty happy with my game It has been a long six or seven years and last year a first home series was amazing and to come out here and really contribute, it is more than I could ever hope for.” 27 balls is all it took to finish the job this morning for the visitors, Cummins then Lyon edging behind in the consecutive overs. A truly magnificent bowling performance again from this Indian attack, surely the best they have ever assmbled. Their loyal fans are going wild in the bottom of the northern stand, as they should. Lyon tries to hook Ishant but only edges it through to Pant. It’s all over! India win the Boxing Day Test for the first time and retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. A mighty performance from Virat Kohli and his men. 89th over: Australia 261-9 (Lyon 7, Hazlewood 0) Somehow, Hazlewood keeps four straight and swinging Bumrah balls off his stumps to survive the over.Lovely fuller delivery that Cummins had to play, the edge found, the ball landing in the safe hands of Pujara at slip. Excellent cricket from the visitors - they have earned this.88th over: Australia 261-8 (Cummins 63, Lyon 7) Ishant beats Lyon first up, driving at a ball away from his body. Lyon gets better as the over goes on, leaving and defending confidently to complete the maiden. The Bharat and Swami Armies look to have joined up in the northern stand and they are making plenty of noise. Great stuff.87th over: Australia 261-8 (Cummins 63, Lyon 7) Bumrah to Cummins from the members end. “It’s basically a new ball,” notes Glenn McGrath on Macquarie radio, so he’s the obvious man to start rather than Jadeja, with eight wickets to his name in this Test. He’s getting the ball through nicely to the gloves of Pant, Cummins fending at one that just misses his outside edge. There are two back on the hook, which McGrath says “is ridiculous” as Cummins ducks under a bouncer - he’s not hooking any time soon.86th over: Australia 261-8 (Cummins 63, Lyon 7) Cummins away first ball, tucking Ishant fine, Lyon then doing likewise. Between times, the ground staff came out to bang away at the run up and lay a bit of sawdust. There’s a half-hearted should from Pant got a catch down the legside, but there’s nothing in that, says Umpire Gunner Gould. Cummins keeps the strike with a push to the sweeper (a sweeper?! Now?) at point. Speaking of Gunner, he knows a bit about being at the MCG on unexpected fifth days. We have 71 overs ahead of us (in theory) because we lose eight from last night. This has been confirmed by CA after a bit of confusion earlier. The tea break will be at 2:55pm, in that unlikely event, but with Pat Cummins there, who would doubt it? Ishant Sharma has the ball in his hand from the Great Southern Stand End and he’ll be starting off at Cummins (61) with Lyon (4) down the other end. Australia require 141 runs for one of the most famous victories in the history of Test cricket. Yeah, I’m talking it up. PLAY!I saw Nathan Lyon’s brother Brendan in the corridor. He’s been getting some very good press (not least from me) for the work he did on Nathan’s batting during the winter. “I wish the rain would go away,” he said to me. “It’s delaying the run chase!” To get us in the mood on the big screen they are showing us Brett Lee’s Test debut 5fa on debut from this fixture in December 1999. I was sitting behind his spell in the Southern Stand that day, behind the arm on level four. Good childhood memories. Why, hello there! Remember yesterday when I said my goodbyes for 2018? Certain that Australia would roll over to have their bellies tickled in time for dinner last night? Well, I was right in a way - the top and middle order did as scripted. Then Pat Cummins showed up and here we are, some 22 hours later with no result acheived as yet.I asked Nathan Lyon last night whether Cummins could captain Australia once Tim Paine gives it away. He didn’t engage with the question, but it got me thinking all the same. Who better? Sure, in the 817 Tests Australia has played, only one has been led by a fast bowler (Lindy filled in for one in 1957). But the world has changed, no? We tend to ignore most of the rules of yesteryear in the modern era, or at least see them adapted. Do you seriously believe that a bloke who can keep his nerve like this after running literally a marathon (according to GPS data) in the field over days one and two would be any less capable calling the shots as well? He’s 25 and Tim Paine is 34, so time is on his side. As I argued in a piece last night, the other contenders - let’s for the purpose of the hypothetical blanket Smith, Marsh the younger and Finch - all have hairs on them. In the case of the latter two, they are both going to be dropped next week as it is. Cummins, meanwhile, could end up a Kapil or an Imran if his batting keeps doing as it does. What did those two do? They only led World Cup winning teams. What do you think? Drop me a line. Let’s talk about Pat the leader as he makes his way to a maiden Test ton. With the covers now off and stumps in the ground, we will be away in 15 minutes from now. You know the deal: email or tweet me your takes.Deepika Sharma emails in: “Hey Geoff, I cancelled my Saturday night plans to see India win and have been checking the weather every minute. Your blog keeps it interesting though and it keeps me awake too!”Never cancel Saturday night plans, my friends. Not for the fickleness of cricket and Melbourne weather. Though the history of an Indian win... last time they won at the MCG, none of the players from either of the current sides was born. But thanks Deepika, it’s been fun. Time for Adam Collins to take over for lunch, then some actual cricket. The covers have just started to be pulled back, to cheers around the ground. And it would be funny if after all this, the session lasts two balls.Thanks for your company. Let’s do it again in Sydney.Psssssh Stella Rossa, I’m making disapproving mouth sounds. “See what happens” is what you do when trying to connect your stereo system after moving house. Or when Muttiah Muralitharan bats. It’s not a viable approach to match tactics. (Ok, granted, it’s often the only approach to match tactics.)Anyway, I do my paying of respects to the history of Test cricket by reading scorecards from 1888.Mates, I will fight Mike Brearley any day of the week. I’m not scared. (Also deeply appreciate that Gavin Robertson’s bio just reads “Not the cricketer.” And that he assumes people have heard of Gavin Robertson the cricketer. Which also brings to mind this moment from Sandpaper week back in March. (Apologies to Gavin Robertson (the cricketer))).Richard Spiller writes in. “Hi Geoff - for those of us in England who had postponed sleep in the hope of seeing Australia finished off, BT Sport are showing (for reasons I haven’t fathomed) an Australia v India ODI at the Gabba in Jan 1986.It’s got a definite period charm – Gavaskar opening the batting wearing a sun hat, the likes of David Gilbert and Syed Kirmani, the Gabba having some iniduality rather than just another stadium and commentary from Benaud, Greig et al. Hope you get some play eventually.”That sounds better than the Test match. Also, your name. I thought Spiller... Spiller. Then it hit me. Have a lunch dance.“And if this ain’t love, why does it feel so good?”Via email, Santosh Venkataraman has rallied to my flag. “India made the right decision based on two more factors. They are using a 4-man bowling attack and were able to give them some rest. The second innings by India of 106-8 showed how dangerous a follow-on would have been. What total would they have been comfortable chasing? Even a total of 120 or 100 with pressure mounting would be tricky to negotiate.” First prize is this giant teddy bear who is choosing not to adopt antiquated Victorian-era tactics.Alright Vectron, if that is your real name. I’ll allow it.It only underlines the point that the tactic is for very specific unusual circumstances, not default use.What ho! A sensible luncheon decision from an ICC official! (I know it’s not the umpires’ fault generally.) But this is great news, and not just because I get to clock off 15 minutes early. (In fact rain sessions are often the most fun on the OBO.) But it means we should get on promptly after lunch. (Another parenthetical caveat.)Tim Hare writes in: “Looking forward later on to  writing up NZ’s series win against Sri Lanka. Four series wins on the bounce now. Incidentally, can you and your followers remember a time when only two Australians would make it into the NZ team? Definitely Gary and Cummins and then crickets.”Tim, if they would let me write about other teams then I would be doing En Zed versus whoever followed by Zimbabwe versus Bangladesh all day long. Love the game, the whole world round. Sadly the remit of  Australia is a little more specific. Also I’m watching another Test match*(*Presently not true, granted.)You’re not far wrong, though, as we do a player comparison for an ANZAC  ANZUS  ANZ BANK team:Latham and Raval v Finch and Harris – three of the four aren’t much chop, but Latham is flying.Khawaja v Williamson – no contest, but Khawaja is the only decent current Australian batsman. Why not have Kane at three and push Usman up to open?Mitch Marsh v de Grandhomme – all-round superiority in both disciplines to Colin, even though he bats seven to Mitch’s six.BJ Watling v Tim Paine – the first close one so far given the leadership and grit quotient, but Watling makes hundreds.Mitchell Starc v Tim Southee – maybe Tim in NZ conditions, but actually not quite. It’s close, especially in the tail-end slogging stakes.Nathan Lyon v Ajaz Patel – no contest.Josh Hazlewood v Trent Boult – on current form, no contest either. The last rain is clearing Melbourne on the radar. You can bet, sure as mountains, that as soon as the surface is ready for play we’ll break for lunch.Most notable in the abstract: “The follow-on decision problem is also briefly considered, and surprisingly, we find that the decision to enforce the follow-on or otherwise has no effect on match outcome.”I’m getting a lot of tweets about the follow-on, which for some reason really gets people going. Let’s just make the personal record clear.The follow-on is trash. It’s the most pointless tactical device around. People get obsessed with using it purely because they have the opportunity to use it. It’s like a milkshake maker, or a firearm.There are a handful of times when you should enforce the follow-on.1) You have literally bowled a team out for 50 in 30 overs.2) Delays mean there are only three or four sessions left.3) The forecast for subsequent days has Noah’s Ark being built.4) The pitch is currently a minefield that will improve with time.Other than that, what’s the point? Where’s the advantage? You work your bowlers harder and longer, deny them the chance to bowl last on a Test pitch, and either cost your batsmen a second hit or potentially make them bat to see out a draw or chase a tricky total. If you don’t enforce it, your team gets another bat, which gives struggling batsmen the chance to make a score or dominant ones the chance to have some fun. You further deflate and tire the opposing bowlers. You give your bowlers more rest, and let them bowl last in the most helpful conditions. Winning a game on day four instead of day five doesn’t change the series scoreline. Fixating on it is just guff.If anyone can make a compelling case the other way, fire at will.A few people asking if any rain-seeding tactics are being used today. I’ll just say that Usman Khawaja is a qualified pilot... If any Australian supporters would like to feel a special breed of angst and despair, I have just the thing.All the covers are on for the moment, large, small, and in between.Be interesting to see what people make of the pitch once this match is done. A lot of talk about it. It looked ugly, but did it start to play better, or were Australia’s batsmen just bad enough to bring the match alive? “Just wanted to say thank you to you, Adam and Jonathan (and all the other hosts) as well as all the OBO-ers for your excellent efforts in this test and over the whole year. It’s a beacon of amusement and camaraderie and a reminder that the game is bigger than a few passing ripples in its pond.”Thanks Ian. In all sincerity, it’s a privilege to be allowed to pilot this strange, lovely, ramshackle thing that has survived and flourished for as many years as it has. Pat Cummins has to do everything.“Hi Geoff,” writes Jeremy. “In your preamble I reckon you’ve put your finger on exactly why I love Test cricket: this game is a piquant mix of a starry-eyed optimism that has you dreaming that your hero can bat all day and the pessimism that is the OBO’s poetic stock in trade.“But best of all are those valiant performances in defeat Cummins’ on-drives yesterday had the look of a captain going down with the ship and trying to hold back the waves while he was at it. And then your mind starts to play those lovely games of ‘what if?’ - sadly, in this case it’s: what if one or two of the top six had shown a tenth of Cummins’ application?”Exactly what I was thinking yesterday. Trailing by 141, it’s not that big a gap. Wring another hundred runs out of the specialists batsmen, and we’d have an all-time classic finish on our hands. The resistance from the lower order, in any match, has a special emotional resonance, but never more than when it has this kind of substance.And now it’s hammering rain at the MCG once more. Australia won’t mind, if this drags on a little longer then we’ll start losing overs. As vain as that hope may be. A few silly types online are already expostulating over Kohli not enforcing the follow-on, as though this is going to make a difference in the end.“Not sure that Indian wickets afford quick bowlers much comfort,” emails John Burton about Bumrah. That’s the perception, but there has been a concerted effort to produce more pace-friendly pitches at times in Indian domestic cricket, which is partly where this generation of excellent quicks has come from. And if that’s where India’s advantage lies in any given series, you can bet that the ground staff at various venues will respond appropriately. It keeps changing. Play was due to start at 11. Then the covers came back on. Now they’re off again.Word from Melbourne’s northern suburbs is that there’s rain coming down there, and thunder. The weather on the radar seems to be coming west to east, and it looks like there’s another band of rain maybe an hour away. I suspect it’ll clear up by the afternoon, so bear with us.The hessian is being stripped. It’s Christmas all over again. The umpires will do an inspection shortly.The time for a start has arrived, but the morning showers are still showering at the ground. The TV broadcasters at Seven are doing a panel on selection with Gideon Haigh and Peter Lalor from The Australian, which is owned by the company that also owns Foxtel, where the broadcast is doing something else. The covers are stripped back to the hessian layers, so we won’t be delayed by much.This is the kind of niche specialist content that Collins can bring you. Also this morning, keep an eye on Jasprit Bumrah. He currently has 47 wickets and is playing his 9th Test. So he can’t quite get to 50 in 9, like Mohammad Abbas so memorably threatened to do for Pakistan this year. But he’s very close, and if he takes 10 Tests he’ll still be the fastest Indian seamer to the mark by a distance. (Ravi Ashwin holds the Indian record with 9 Tests, Terror Turner holds the all-time record with 6 Tests.) For Bumrah, it’s a truly remarkable rise for someone who was an unknown curiosity bowler in the IPL a few years ago, who only debuted in Tests this year, and who’s never had the comfort of playing at home. Now, the weather. “Tell me how we feel about the weather,” says the poet Derrick Brown. “Talk about the moon, but not about how it f–––s up our blood.” The weather has its emotional impact on us all, and cricket players or watchers are among the most concretely affected. Rain can be saviour or tormentor. There is some rain around Melbourne this morning, and a bit of grumbling thunder even now. But the forecast and the radar show patchy bits, so it won’t be enough to wash out a day. We might lose a bit of time, but even that’s unlikely with the umpires showing on day four how late they’re willing to play with the floodlights on. I’ll keep you posted, but rain isn’t expected to play a role.Here’s that poem, if you want to feel something for a few minutes while we wait.I like believing in impossible things. That’s one of the attractions of cricket – there’s always the chance that a certain day will be special, a day on which you may see something no one has seen before. And most of the time you don’t, but very occasionally you do. Which isn’t to say that I’m entertaining the idea of Australia winning this Test match. 141 runs behind, with only the No11 yet to bat, on a fifth-day pitch that has misbehaved since day two, against a bowling attack with strong claims to being the best in the world. This isn’t England in Adelaide in 2017, or even Australia in Adelaide a couple of weeks ago. Coming into the last day those times there was at least an outside chance. Here it’s numerically just not an option.But perhaps the three remaining batsmen – Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon and Josh Hazlewood – could at least have a last day that’s memorable. Perhaps they can bat for an hour, or get the deficit under 100. Perhaps Cummins could make a hundred of his own. Perhaps a lot of things, the beauty of which is that we never know.I won’t build it up too much, because they could equally lose two wickets in the first over and we’ll be done. But even if that happens, it doesn’t detract from how special Cummins and Lyon were last night. Batting on, and on, and on, into the dark. Batting until 5:30. Having the session extended almost half an hour to get the overs in. Having it extended another half hour because they were eight wickets down. And battling through all that, in the gloom, under the floodlights, against Jasprit Bumrah sending the ball flying and Ravindra Jadeja whirring away on a length, defending and at times counter-attacking, especially the crisp drives Cummins unfurled once he approached his half-century.What an effort from those Australian bowling batsmen after a match in which they’ve worked so hard. It was special already, and it could get a little more special this morning. What could be equally special is India taking a series lead with one match to play, uncharted territory for an Indian team on these shores. Whatever form any specialness takes, I’ll let you know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1e51e481a5f8d9f4834856ecd6d32e4a2d67ec8/0_192_4326_2595/master/4326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13917e78ab5f6b6c5e98d987a5ccb38","title":"idris elba luther returns","story":"After a disappointing last season, Idris Elba’s DCI arrives in preposterous form, kicking in doors and looking a bit vacant“Can you breathe? Shame that,” mutters DCI John Luther, handcuffing another faceless criminal, as a nation sighs in ecstasy. We all know that Luther (New Year’s Day, 9pm, BBC One) – about a cop with a malfunctioning moral compass – should have been forcibly retired at the end of the second series, shortly before its brain fell out and it resorted to serving up prettily kohled corpses and baddies lurking under beds. But its star Idris Elba is a lady-magnet who will definitely, possibly, perhaps be the next James Bond, and television is an idiot. So here he is again, wearily stalking the streets and smouldering ferociously in tweed. Like his spirit animal, Sherlock Holmes, our hero favours a “statement” coat that ratchets up the handsomeness and which could feasibly house a family of four.Luther’s London is alive with cartoon maniacs wielding hammers, home-made explosives, or large suitcases into which they can stuff unsuspecting women who assumed the nice man had come to fix the fridge. This would certainly explain why our troubled detective looks permanently in need of a nap.Here, he and his colleagues are in pursuit of a killer who gets his jollies puncturing victims with needles or relieving them of their eyeballs, and who wears a hoodie with built-in LED lights in order to outfox CCTV surveillance. Meanwhile, as Luther’s boss (Dermot Crowley) shuffles around looking like a man whose dog has died and house has been repossessed on the same day, Patrick Malahide’s cockney gangster is on the warpath, because no one has cast him in EastEnders and also because someone has kidnapped his son.The new Luther, much like the old Luther, doesn’t deal in nuance. As the killer lines up his quarry, the soundtrack groans. Rudimentary questions abound: why does no one ever turn any lights on? Why is Luther’s house decorated like Dot Cotton’s kitchen after a hurricane has blown through it? (Poirot would never put up with this crap.) And why, when he has a brainwave and rushes off, leaving his colleagues dangling mid-sentence, don’t they shout after him: “Er, bonjour? I was in the middle of talking, you awful dickhead”?And yet. Elba is, as always, excellent, even while doing comparatively little. His technique is to maintain a blank expression and sigh a lot while taking up as much physical space as possible. Watching Luther clamber into a car is like seeing a sleeping bag being stuffed back into its casing. Every now and then, he’ll kick a door in or smash a window with his fist, just to remind us what a hard bastard he is. But – in a welcome plot development that will surprise precisely no one – it is the return of an old friend, waving a gun, bleeding profusely and gently tickling his weak spot, that signals the return of the series’ long departed va-va-voom. Luther is left flailing as he’s drawn into a web of bloody mischief involving diamonds, outrageous financial demands and … a turkey skewer. It’s incredibly preposterous, of course, but ’twas ever thus. Luther’s back on screen and at long last he has been put in his place. All is right with the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51b0654f22a968d05e0a5fc4f7d3964ec99cc509/0_270_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab058fe6af522d9620cda90aa4b9e346","title":"bbc writes to russia after journalists details are published online","story":"World Service director says safety of staff in Moscow is its ‘overriding concern’ The BBC has written to Russian authorities to express concern about the safety of its staff in Moscow after it emerged that the details of dozens of the broadcasters’ journalists had been published online in apparent retaliation to the publication in the Sunday Times of eight Edinburgh-based Sputnik reporters’ details.Its World Service director said the safety of its staff in Moscow was the BBC’s “overriding concern”, and stressed that the broadcaster had always acted “in full compliance” with Russian law.“The BBC has asked the Russian authorities to investigate this worrying development,” Jamie Angus said. “The welfare and security of our staff in Moscow is our overriding concern.

In September, the brand debuted a line of jackets inspired by an unlikely trendsetter: India’s 68-year old prime minister, Narendra Modi.The “Modi jacket” is sleeveless, extends down below the belt and rises at the neck to form a stand-up collar. Khadi staff say they are selling at least 100 every day,. Modi’s supporters call it proof of the prime minister’s popular appeal. Critics call the jacket a fraud.“It’s not a Modi jacket,” says Ashok Swain, a professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, who frequently makes his displeasure with the prime minister known on Twitter. “It’s the same style that Jawaharlal Nehru made popular. It’s exactly the same. Modi just changed the colour.”Modi is unique among Indian leaders for his devotion to Hindu nationalism, a movement that has vied for more than a century to reshape the idea of India. Where Nehru, the country’s first and most influential prime minister, saw a blended nation of idiosyncratic religious and cultural beliefs, Modi sees a Hindu nation, stifled for too long by Delhi’s secular elites.Battles over the prominence of Nehru have raged in India these past five years. Modi’s party has announced it is building a museum to “all prime ministers” at a site previously reserved for Nehru’s memorial and library. They have burnished the legacies of other founding leaders such as Sardar Patel – the subject of the largest statue in the world, unveiled by Modi in October. Two years ago, a government panel in Rajasthan almost erased Nehru from Indian textbooks altogether.Now the Nehru-cum-Modi jacket has found itself drafted into the wider fight over Indian history and identity.South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, unknowingly waded into the dispute a few weeks ago, when he tweeted a picture of himself wearing a “Modi vest” the Indian leader had sent him.“It’s really nice of our PM to send these but could he not have sent them without changing the name?” replied Omar Abdullah, a former state leader from an opposition party .“All my life I’ve known these jackets as Nehru jackets \u0026amp now I find these ones have been labelled ‘Modi Jacket’,” he added. “Clearly nothing existed in India before 2014 (the year Mr Modi came into power)’.”At Khadi, sales assistant Yogesh says the two jackets are different. Modi’s version has no collar, he insists, and its pockets are diagonal. “Before Modi, we used to call them ladies’ jackets,” he adds furtively.Next door, the manager of men’s tailor SM \u0026amp Sons, Ravinder Bawa, disagrees. “This is one of the oldest jackets,” he says. “Modi’s is more or less the same, but he wears bright colours, while Nehru wore cream and white.”Nehru himself only made popular a garment that had been worn for hundreds of years, originating in the courtly dress of India’s Mughal era. The stand-up Nehru collars were briefly a sensation in the west in the 1960s, after the newly enlightened Beatles began sporting them. Sammy Davis Jr claimed to own more than 200 in his wardrobe.In Bawa’s store, they still call it a Nehru jacket. “But nobody asks for those any more,” he says. “They ask for Modi jackets only.”One authority on the subject is Bipin Chauhan, whose menswear store in Gujarat, JadeBlue, has been designing Modi’s clothes since 1989.“It’s been around for a long time,” he says, but trained eyes can spot the difference. “Nehru’s used to wear his shorter and a bit tighter.

The men had spent two months locked in an epic race which had echoes of past polar feats, including the British and Norwegian push to the south pole over a century ago.“I’m absolutely elated, and relieved that I’ve managed to complete the journey,” Rudd told the Observer in a satellite phone call from his tent, which last night was pitched above the frozen Antarctic coastline. “It’s a minor miracle that both of us actually completed this the odds of both of us doing it were so slim.”A major inspiration for the 56-day expedition was the loss of his friend, Henry Worsley, a fellow explorer who died while attempting to break the same record nearly three years ago. Rudd carried a flag with Worsley’s family crest on the journey, even though he stripped all other provisions down to such bare essentials that he didn’t carry a change of underwear. “The fact that Henry’s flag made it all the way across, that means a great deal,” he said. He hopes to speak to Worsley’s widow today.Both Rudd and O’Brady travelled across Antarctica on skis, pulling all their provisions behind them on special sleighs for more than 50 days. They were forced to weigh up the need to consume up to 10,000 calories a day against the challenge of pulling anything they wanted to eat along with all their other supplies.But while O’Brady is a professional athlete who travelled with protein-packet “Colin bars” tailored to his needs by nutrition specialists, Rudd took a more low-key approach to the “grazing bag” that kept him going through long days of skiing.Rudd admits he was blindsided by the transformation of his expedition into a global race. He only found out that O’Brady would be trying the same journey a few days before he flew out of Britain for Antarctica.He was glad media interest in an epic contest helped bring more attention to their expeditions and the causes Rudd is supporting, including fundraising for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity, but decided from the start not to treat the crossing as a contest.“I didn’t want to get drawn into a race. I knew the expedition would be difficult enough as it was,” he said. “All that mattered to me was that I completed it, that I skied solo and unsupported, carrying the flag with Henry’s family crest.”There were times when he found it hard to push on. “I skied through some horrendous conditions,” he said. “I would be skiing along thinking, ‘my God, this is the worst place in the world right now this is horrific’.”Rudd is one of the most experienced polar explorers in the world, but the trip went far beyond anything he had attempted before, not only in terms of its length but also the solitude. It was his first solo expedition, and it would last around two months.“In normal life, in military service you don’t end up in those situations, I’d probably never spent more than a couple of days on my own prior to this expedition, if that.”A small collection of audiobooks, including military history and four biographies of Churchill – he got through three – provided something like company, and sometimes he skied to music, including U2 and Pink Floyd.Beyond that the only other life he saw was a brief stop at a scientific base at the South Pole, where around 15 to 20 people were waiting to cheer Rudd on. He could talk to them, but not go inside, or even accept so much as a cup of tea without his trip losing its “unsupported” status.“I stayed for about an hour and as I skied off it was quite daunting to suddenly be on my own again,” he said. “I didn’t stay too long deliberately, as I was keen to get away from temptation.” Rudd is now relaxing with O’Brady in temperatures of -10 degrees – which after the extremes of his trek “feels almost tropical” – and enjoying supplies buried a year ago for another explorer who attempted but didn’t finish the trip.“We are camped 10 feet apart,” he said. “There’s some coffee and milk powder so we are sat feasting like kings on things buried in the ice for a year, but it still tastes good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Paintings at centre of

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAA Government department has spent more than £100 million on ferries to ease potential problems in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Documents outlining the £107.7 million (€120 million) agreements say increased border checks in UK ports after Brexit could “cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed” in the event of no deal.The move was described as “complete madness” by the Liberal Democrats, who said it showed public money was being spent recklessly in a last-minute bid to prepare for a no-deal outcome.The Department for Transport (DfT) has signed contracts with French firm Brittany Ferries, Danish company DFDS and the UK’s Seaborne to ease pressure on Dover.The additional crossings are understood to be the equivalent of around 10 per cent of the current traffic on the Dover Strait and will see ports in Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe used.Contracts were not put out to tender, with the DfT saying it was a “situation of extreme urgency” brought about by “unforeseeable events”.The contract with Brittany Ferries is worth £46.6 million (€51.77 million), with the company adding 19 return sailings to three routes between the UK and France. More sailings will travel between Roscoff and Plymouth, Cherbourg and Poole, and Le Havre and Portsmouth, representing a 50 per cent increase on its current schedule.Christophe Mathieu, Brittany Ferries chief executive, said: “Our priority is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and to create additional capacity.“By increasing the number of rotations on routes like Le Havre — Portsmouth we will be able to meet the Department for Transport’s Brexit requirement.“We will also work hard to minimise impact on existing Brittany Ferries freight customers and passengers, although there may be some changes to some sailing times, for which we apologise in advance.”A spokesman for the DfT said: “This significant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s no-deal Brexit planning.“While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached successfully, the department is helping ensure the rest of Government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios, including a particular focus on a potential no-deal and to mitigate the impact of any Brexit outcome on all transport modes.”A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: “It is complete madness to see the Government recklessly handing over £100 million on preparing British ports for a no-deal scenario.“The Government has the power to stop no-deal at any time but instead is spending millions on last-minute contracts.”Eloise Todd, leader of the Best for Britain campaign for a second EU referendum, said: “The truth is no-deal is not inevitable. This Government has a real choice to make for our country and it does not have to toy with a cliff-edge Brexit.“The only way forward for the country right now is to put the decision back to the people and put the public at the heart of the decision over our future. People have been locked out of the Brexit process since the 2016 vote — it’s time to bring them back in and let them decide our future.”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The ‘Spirit of Endurance’ expedition was a world-record attempt to be the first person to ski alone over 1,000 miles across Antarctica, unsupported and unassisted.Mr O’Brady reached the finish line just 48 hours ahead of Captain Rudd, who spent 56 days on the frozen continent before finishing at the foot of Leverett Glacier.Captain Rudd, who never considered himself to be racing O\u0027Brady,  saluted the American’s achievement in his expedition blog, saying: it\u0027s always been about completing the journey.Fantastic, well done to him,” he said. “He\u0027d pushed really hard all the way across and done extremely well, so congratulations to him.British Army Captain Louis Rudd, who has just completed a solo, unassisted trek across Antarctica.The veteran of multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan ascribed the self-discipline and mental and physical robustness needed to haul a 140kg sled across 932 miles of ice and snow to his 33 years in the Royal Marines and Army.Writing during his journey he said he kept himself going by listening to music from the 1980s and audio books about Churchill.“I find that’s quite good actually, particularly when you’re on your own, to actually to hear a voice talking, it’s a bit of company,” he blogged from the ice.“I listened to an audiobook – a biography of Churchill. I’ve actually got two or three audiobooks on him which I’ll be listening to throughout the journey. One of those was written by Boris Johnson.”  Both Captain Rudd and American Colin O’Brady completed their epic journeys totally unsupported by supply drops or specialist equipment to harness wind power, which could help drag their sleds.Captain Rudd\u0026#39s sled and equipment weighed 140kgs at the start of his endeavour. Speaking exclusively to the  from his tent at the finish point, Captain Rudd, an ambassador for ABF The Soldiers’ Charity, said he had never seriously considered turning back. “I had some really hard days where I thought it might not be feasible to get across. “On one day I battled for eight or nine hours and covered two nautical miles. I thought ‘this is ridiculous’, stopped and put the tent up. I still had 800 miles to go. Eventually I made better progress and it was back on. Going solo unsupported across Antarctica was one of the great final Polar journeys that hadn’t been accomplished, so the temptation to come down and have a go at it for me was overwhelming.”Throughout the journey, Captain Rudd, a married father of three, carried a flag bearing the family crest of his friend and fellow soldier Henry Worsley, who died in 2016 attempting the same challenge. Mr Worsley had died of an illness having been rescued just 30 miles from the finish line.Prior to his departure Captain Rudd said he had sought the approval and blessing from his friend’s family.I\u0027m carrying Henry\u0027s flag... that he carried on all his journeys, and it\u0027s really important to me that, this time, the flag goes all the way, and completes the journey right to the end, he said“Hopefully I’ve done you and Henry proud, he blogged to Joanna Worsley, with what I’ve achieved and got the flag to the far side,” he said.Talking of his love for the vastness and isolation of Antarctica, Captain Rudd said: “It’s a real raw beauty and completely untouched by mankind.“There’s always a sense that the place can kill you within minutes. The slightest mistake can have grave consequences. You always have very healthy respect for the great white queen.Captain Rudd has previously been a recipient of the MBE.“I’m not there to conquer Antarctica - I hate that term, do not ever be so arrogant to say that you can go down and conquer Antarctica. If you’re lucky she’ll let you in to achieve your objectives.

He died on the way to hospital, Mohammad Niamutullah, police chief in the southern town of Patia, said.The death brought to four the number of people confirmed killed by police since the timetable for the election was announced on November 8, marking the country’s 11th parliamentary election since independence in 1971.The BNP claims eight of its activists have died.Vehicles in Dhaka burn after an opposition rally which ended with police using tear gas and batons after the election was announcedAround 104 million voters are choosing between an alliance led by Hasina’s ruling Awami League party and a coalition headed by the BNP which was cobbled together only three months ago.Opinion polls show Hasina, who has presided over impressive economic growth during an unbroken decade in power but who is also accused of growing authoritarianism, heading for a comfortable victory.She needs 151 seats in the first-past-the-post system to win in the 300-seat parliament but experts say any victory would be sullied by accusations that she hamstrung her opponents’ campaign.The opposition says more than 15,000 of its activists have been arrested, crippling its ability to mobilise its grassroots support.Human Rights Watch and other international groups have decried the crackdown, saying it has created a climate of fear which could prevent supporters of opposition parties from casting their ballots.The United States has also raised concerns about the credibility of the Muslim-majority country’s election while the United Nations has called for greater efforts to make the vote fair.Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, secretary general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)Seventeen opposition candidates were arrested over what they claim are trumped up charges while another 17 were disqualified from running by courts which are allegedly controlled by Hasina.This is not (a) free and fair election. It is more a controlled selection, said a Western diplomat who has been monitoring the run-up to the polls and who asked not to be named.Badiul Alam Majumder, the leader of a Bangladesh civil society group, said the alleged crackdown had created a perception that the incumbent government will return to power.Never in my life I have seen such kind of election. The election commission has totally failed to do its job, he said.The BNP, the main player in the alliance headed by Kamal Hossain, an 82-year-old Oxford-educated lawyer who drew up Bangladesh’s constitution, has accused the election commission of bias – allegations it denies.Supporters of Bangladesh Awami League march along a street as they take part in a rally ahead of December 30 general election voteHasina herself has rejected accusations of creeping authoritarianism and called for voters to back her to further bolster the economy which has expanded over six percent a year since she won the 2008 election.The daughter of Bangladesh’s first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina was gifted victory in the 2014 election when the BNP boycotted the vote claiming it wasn’t free or fair.Since then, rights groups have accused Hasina’s administration of stifling freedom of speech through the toughening of a draconian anti-press law and the enforced disappearance of government dissenters.BNP leader Khaleda Zia, an arch-rival of the prime minister, was sentenced to 17 years in jail earlier this year on charges that her party says are politically motivated.Authorities have ordered the country’s mobile operators to shut down 3G and 4G services until midnight on Sunday to prevent the spread of rumours that could trigger unrest.Polls close at 4:00pm (1000 GMT).Please review our commenting policyDemocratic Republic of Congo vote in troubled electionOne dead, 23 in hospital after bus overturns in Scottish bordersOdds of Brexit happening are \u0026#3950-50\u0026#39 if May\u0026#39s deal is rejected, Liam Fox warns Braveheart plot query, Bangkok massage haggling and Strictly updates -

In “Playtest”, starring Wyatt Russell, the front cover of\u0026nbspEdge\u0026nbspmagazine indicates that there is a review of “Bandersnatch”\u0026nbspinside. In the scene, Sonja uses the magazine to encourage Cooper to take a mysterious job with video game company SaitoGemu.\u0026nbspThe episode opens with Stefan at home with his father, a widow, offering him a choice of breakfast cereal (the first decision the user is faced with). From there, he travels to an interview with a\u0026nbspgames company so he can pitch his idea for a game adaptation of the multiple choice novel, Bandersnatch, which was written by a man who descended into madness as he completed it.\u0026nbspAt the office, he is introduced to Colin Ritman\u0026nbsp(Coulter), Stefan\u0027s hero, and a man with whom you can have either a lot or barely any interaction with, depending on the choices you make. Throughout the film there are loops that guide you back to the correct narrative if you stray too far, such as when Stefan is asked whether he wants to work in the office or at home, on his own. The home option is preferred as it leads to Stefan\u0027s own slow descent into madness as he becomes obsessed with completing Bandersnatch.As he works, he becomes more and more irritated by interruptions from his father, and trips to his therapist. You can learn during therapy\u0026nbsp(as we did in this version of the story) that his mother died in a train crash after Stefan caused her to miss an earlier train – an event that likely triggered\u0026nbsphis current mental health issues.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

Bandersnatch is released to rave reviews, as a current-day news report informs us that Stefan was later arrested and charged with his father\u0027s murder.\u0026nbspThis writer was slightly sceptical at how Netflix is managing to get viewers to watch the episode countless times to see the various endings... meaning mega streams for them. At first the interactions are fun, but the constant interruptions to the story as you\u0027re asked to make yet another decision on Stefan\u0027s behalf can become\u0026nbspquite wearisome, and if anything it pulls you out of the story rather than allowing\u0026nbspyou to become engrossed in it.Netflix says of the new interactive film: “There are choices to be made, challenges to overcome, dangers to encounter and, as always in life (and Black Mirror), consequences to be had. Choosing wisely could lead to triumph while taking the wrong path could end in disaster – but who’s to say what’s ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, anyway? And fret not because once one experience comes to a close, you can – and should! – go back and make a new choice, alter the path of your story and maybe even change its outcome.”The liveblog has now closed.\u0026nbspInteractive film was released on Netflix today (Friday 28 December)Bandersnatch\u0026nbspoffers viewers the chance to decide the fate of its lead character, computer game creator\u0026nbspStefanAudience members can choose anything from the song he decides to listen to, to whether he attends a therapy sessionNetflix also confirmed that there are “five main endings with multiple variants of each”... although fans could uncover more depending on the choices they make, allowing for a little extra mystery.\u0026nbspRead our review of\u0026nbspBandersnatch,\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearAccording to Ayre, bitcoin will be superseded by a more technologically advanced cryptocurrency that functions better as an actual currency, such as bitcoin cash.On the other end of the scale is Mr Lee, whose predictions about bitcoin have been proved to be wildly optimistic in the past.\u0026nbspAs recently as November, Mr Lee predicted bitcoin would hit $15,000 by the end of 2018, but appears undeterred by more price falls in his\u0026nbspforecast that bitcoin could hit $36,000 in 2019.\u0026nbspThose positive about bitcoin\u0027s future point to\u0026nbsphe general progression of the\u0026nbspcryptocurrency\u0026nbspand blockchain industry over the last 12 months, with one analyst suggesting bitcoin is currently undervalued.Can Norwegian waterfalls stop bitcoin from destroying the planet?In my opinion, now is a great time to purchase bitcoin, blockchain adviser Olver Isaacs told\u0026nbspThe Independent.

Due to the different paths the story can take, the film can last between 40 to 90 minutes.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch, review – Intriguing but imperfect How Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is an experiment on usWhat happened when we watched the Black Mirror film, BandersnatchIf you don’t have the time (or patience) to watch the film multiple times, however, you can pick the option that appears as the credits begin to roll, to loop back to a crucial moment in the story and change your choices, to see if they cause a different ending.This means that you can see most of the possible variants without having to start from the very beginning.\u0026nbspThese are the endings fans have discovered so far:1) The very quick one,\u0026nbspwhere the user accepts an offer to join Thakur\u0027s team and develop his video game in the office, instead of refusing. Bandersnatch\u0026nbspthen flashes to an ending in which a rushed version of his game gets zero stars from a critic, as Stefan decides to “try again” — inviting the viewer to go back and make him develop the game on his own.\u0026nbsp2) In another, Stefan\u0027s widower father comes into his room after weeks of Stefan working alone on the game. You can either force Stefan to shout at his dad or make him throw\u0026nbsphis tea\u0026nbspover his computer. Destroying Stefan’s computer ends the story. In a similar moment, when Stefan becomes frustrated with the game\u0027s progress you can either make him destroy his computer or bang his fist on the desk. Destroying the computer ends the game, again.3) The balcony ending happens when Stefan is taken to see Dr Haynes by his father, where he spots Colin walking down the street. If Stefan follows Colin instead of attending therapy, the pair embark on a night of drugs and philosophy, which then leads to a moment where Colin claims it doesn\u0027t matter if one of them jumps from his balcony.\u0026nbspThe viewer is told to either force Stefan to jump,\u0026nbspor make him tell Colin to do it. The former choice ends the story with Stefan’s suicide, and his game is finished “abruptly” without him, to negative reviews.4) Bandersnatch pushes the story forward so that Stefan has to visit Dr Haynes for a session and get a prescription for pills. If you do choose to make Stefan see Dr\u0026nbspHaynes instead of following Colin, she’ll give him the pills and you’ll have to decide whether he should flush them or take them.\u0026nbspOnce you make Stefan take his medication, the story jumps to Christmas, where Stefan has been taking his pills for months. His game is released, but the critic only gives it two-and-a-half stars and criticises it for feeling as though it were made on\u0026nbsp“autopilot”.5) In\u0026nbspthe most meta ending of the film, Stefan demands to know the truth: Who is controlling him? If you decide to tell him that his life is actually\u0026nbspentertainment on “a streaming platform from the early 21st century” (Netflix), he returns to\u0026nbspDr\u0026nbspHaynes’s office to tell her about it.\u0026nbspThe doctor points out that if Stefan’s story was true, surely this scenario of him at a therapist\u0027s office would be too boring for such an advanced form of entertainment. Things then take a bizarre turn as she leaps out of her chair and challenges him to a brawl, complete with swords.\u0026nbspYou have to decide whether Stefan should fight her or flee by jumping through a window, and if you choose the latter, the fourth wall breaks completely, revealing Stefan is\u0026nbspactually an actor standing on the Black Mirror set. A\u0026nbspdirector then storms over to tell him that he’s “not scripted to jump out, it’s the fight scene now.. The story ends after the actor asserts that his real name is Stefan, marking his final break with reality, and the production team calls a medic.6) There are several endings where\u0026nbspStefan goes to prison\u0026nbspfor murdering his father. (Depending on the route, he also ends\u0026nbspup killing Thakur, Colin, or Colin’s wife, Kitty) In all these versions of the story, you\u0027re essentially forced to make Stefan kill his father if you didn’t choose to already.\u0026nbspThen you have to decide between burying or chopping up his body. All the ways of burying the body lead to Stefan in jail and Bandersnatch getting trashed by the critic, if it gets released at all.7) Arguably the most sinister ending is when you make Stefan chop up his dead father\u0027s body, and he finally gets time to finish the game,\u0026nbspwhich gets five stars from the critic when it’s released — although the game is\u0026nbsppulled from sale after Stefan gets caught and sent to jail. From there, Bandersnatch flashes forward to the present day, where Colin\u0027s daughter Pearl is shown to be working on an archive version of the game for a new generation. When she encounters the\u0026nbspsame bugs that Stefan did, the old question returns: should she throw tea\u0026nbspher computer, or destroy it?8) A few people worked out that “TOY” is the password that Stefan needs to recover his favourite stuffed bunny from his father’s safe, he then travels back to that moment in his past and places it under his childhood bed. His mother still misses her train while the young Stefan looks for his toy, but this time\u0026nbspthe viewer is given more than one choice when she asks if he wants to go with her. If Stefan says “yes,” he dies in the train crash with his mum, after which the teenage Stefan is shown suddenly dying in his therapist\u0027s office.One fan went the extra mile and made a graph of all the alternatives in the same style as the game map itself:Reviews for the new film have been mixed, but mostly positive.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsppraised it for being “innovative” with the interactive elements, adding:\u0026nbsp”What saves the film from pure gimmickry is the way in which its mechanism is bound up with the plot.Created with Sketch.Every Black Mirror episode ranked – from worst to best Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Click through for our ranking of every Black Mirror episode to date620 Hated in the NationBandersnatch, “Hated in the Nation” is Brooker’s answer to Scandi Noir dramas such as The Killing.

He was holding a print-out of the draft of an article I’d written. “You did law, didn’t you,” he stated. It was true, my degree was in law. I nodded.\u0026nbsp“What’s this?” He asked, pointing to his desk. “It’s a desk,” I said. “Well f*****g well say so. Don’t say, ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs, and therefore might be a desk.’ It’s a desk.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI can’t tell you how often I’m reminded of Bambridge’s words. There is hardly a day that goes by when I don’t see a piece of writing or hear a speech that is pure verbiage, and can only have been produced by a lawyer or a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe latest example is particularly shocking. When I last looked, BT was supposed to be a communications company. Okay, telecommunications. But a corporation, nevertheless, that ought to pride itself on directness and speed of delivery. In that context, the ability of the receiver to comprehend should be paramount.\u0026nbspUnited Airlines mocked for corporate speak response to passenger rowSo, take this, from BT as it promises to overhaul its pay policies after the investor backlash following the £2.3m package handed to departing boss Gavin Patterson. The company will consider “a broader range of performance factors and wider circumstances” when determining executive remuneration. It also pointed to “a more structured process to help it step through the application of its discretion in the future.”Eh? Who writes this stuff? Clearly, not someone who believes in telling it how it is, and is unable to say something for definite without suffocating it in qualification. That has to be a lawyer, or as I say, a robot, or both.\u0026nbspThe problem with this approach is that it suggests an organisation that is hidebound, stricken with fear, unable to proceed without a high degree of caution, incapable of saying “we screwed up, and we’re sorry”. Patterson received too much –\u0026nbspperhaps not under the strict terms of his contract –\u0026nbspbut, given the company’s poor showing, too much.\u0026nbspDecisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out.But BT cannot admit that, oh no. It won’t try to claw back the money as that would be unseemly, and besides, the lawyers have probably advised that would be difficult. Instead, it attempts to sooth and gloss over with words straight out of the lawyers’ lexicon of “safe” twaddle.\u0026nbspSlight as it is, in the overall picture of a multi-billion pound global empire, BT’s announcement about leaders’ pay is indicative of a loss of way, a lack of confidence. Intuition has succumbed to process.\u0026nbspWith any management there should be room for both, for the heart and the head. Of course, things have to be done properly and carefully, but they also need to be done. Decisions must be taken, conversations must be had and understood. Running to lawyers, sheltering behind legalese, is a default, a cop out. It is not the answer.Too often, I’ve seen the lawyers rule the roost. On a product safety issue, where fatalities had ensued, they were reluctant to let the management meet the relatives and express their condolences, because this could lead to an admission of liability. In another episode, involving a food company, they took the same line. Again, after a tragedy, a holiday operator was told on no account to contact the family.\u0026nbspWhile lawyers may give their advice for the best of intentions, to avoid the client being shredded in the law courts, and having to pay out vast sums, they do not afford enough attention to that other court, the one of public opinion –\u0026nbspand the one that these days, especially with instant relaying of news, 24-hour bulletins and social media, is increasingly vital.\u0026nbspThere’s little point in shoring up a legal defence, in cloaking a company’s actions in legal procedure and its outpourings in law-speak, if it simply makes the company the subject of derision, and harms its reputation.\u0026nbspSurely\u0026nbspit’s not beyond the wit of any intelligent C-suite member to say they share the loved ones’ pain, without stating there and then, it was the company’s fault? Likewise, is it really impossible for BT to say it recognises, and is concerned about investors’ frustrations, and will do its utmost to prevent a recurrence?Ask any business chief what keeps them awake at night, and they will say loss of reputation –\u0026nbspto the business, and to them, personally. It’s humans who determine how they and their organisation are judged, the basis for that\u0026nbsp reputation. Be human in everything they do, is the easiest way of achieving plaudits. That means being human in how they communicate, and in their actions.\u0026nbspPlease BT, in future, before you press “send”, stand back and read what you’re about to convey. Listen to the lawyers, but, remember, you’re human and you’re talking to humans.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Private schools are cheating the system to inflate their results and give their pupils, who are already advantaged, a further boost.“State schools have dealt with changes to GCSEs really well, but there is no doubt that we have seen huge upheaval with increased stress for pupils and workload for teachers.“State school pupils have been treated like guinea pigs whilst many independent schools have gamed the system, insulating their institutions and their pupils against these changes, keeping the easier International GCSES completely, or waiting for the new GCSEs to bed in before opting to enter their pupils on to these courses.“There is a growing concern that the new GCSEs are having a real impact on child mental health and well-being and are not equipping young people with the skills for the 21st century.“That private schools have reached the same conclusion should send alarm bells ringing for everyone.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People remove a  Santa hat on the 20 metres tall steel sculpture \u0027Angel of the North\u0027, outside Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in NE Engand.

The major update – which would have been perhaps the biggest change to Instagram ever – was so widely despised that numerous users suggested the app is now dead.But very shortly after, the change appeared to be reverted and the feed went back to normal. And now it appears all of that happened by accident.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Sorry about that, this was supposed to be a very small test but we went broader than we anticipated,” Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote on Twitter, alongside an awkward-looking emoji. The change went to “a few orders of magnitude more people than intended”, he wrote.He said the change “should already be rolled back”. If it is still appearing, he told users they should “simply restart your app and you should be good to go”, Mr Mosseri advised.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The alteration was just intended as a test, he said, giving no indication that it would be rolling out widely and properly any time in the near future.An Instagram statement suggested the change was a bug, rather than an accident, but both Mr Mosseri and the company\u0027s spokespeople were presumably referring to the same incident.“Due to a bug, some users saw a change to the way their feed appears today, the\u0026nbspstatement read.\u0026nbspWe quickly fixed the issue and feed is back to normal. We apologise for any confusion.Confusion as new Instagram appears and disappearsMr Mosseri only recently took up his position as Instagram’s boss, though he has worked for a long time at Facebook, most recently as the head of its News Feed. He was moved into his new\u0026nbsprole after Instagram’s founders left the company, reportedly in the wake of disagreements over its future direction.The roll-out of the change to the feed had already appeared strange: Instagram does usually allow small groups of people to test out new features, before slowly rolling them out to everyone who uses it. But this time around the update appeared to arrive on everyone’s phone all at once, dropping rapidly on Thursday afternoon UK time.When the change happened, it came with a screen that explained why it had arrived and how to use it. That suggested the change was not the result of a bug or that it had happened by accident, but presumably the same screen was only meant to be seen by the small number of people who would get access to the altered feed.Soon after, the new feed started reverting back to normal, before Instagram chose to announce that the update had been a mistake.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/17/instagram.jpg","title":"instagram update latest scrolling why reverse old version guide swipe","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

You can change the order in which they appear, and even hide the ones you never use, to speed up your photo-sharing process. On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The message that pops up when the update arrives offers some clue about why this happened: Stories.Instagram update completely changes how users scroll through feedInstagram notes that the feature is more similar to the Stories tool that rolled out in 2016, allowing people to post disappearing photos and videos that could be clicked through in exactly the same way. It even tells people that they can use the same feed in just the same way.Since 2016, Stories has become probably the most quickly growing kind of media ever to be launched: not just on Instagram but everywhere on the web, the side-swiping, clicky way of getting through an app has spread itself across the entire internet. Instagram Stories is now twice as big as rival Snapchat, and makes up a major part of the way people use the app.Presumably excited by the vast popularity of those Stories, Instagram has decided to make everything else work that way, too.It is worth noting that even as Stories have gone from strength to strength, and Instagram has continued to grow, the company\u0027s founders also recently left the company. That was because of disputes with owners Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg about the direction of the company, according to a report in Bloomberg\u0026nbsp– and it may be that features such as these were the cause of those disagreements.It seems to be on its way to everybody, though that doesn\u0027t mean you\u0027ll definitely have got it yet. Force quitting the app and scrolling around a little appears to make the new feature most likely to arrive.Usually, new Instagram features – especially ones like this, which bring dramatic changes – are rolled out slowly, to a small group of people first and then gradually to everybody else. But this appears to have come in one fell swoop, on Thursday afternoon UK time.They hate it. Almost everybody seems to absolutely despise the update.Searching for the word Instagram on Twitter brings a whole host of posts, many including explicit language unfit for this website.Give me back my timeline, one illustrative but relatively family-friendly post reads.\u0026nbspThis update SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In short: no. Instagram isn\u0027t giving its users the ability to use the old format, even temporarily: once the update has arrived, it has arrived forever, by the looks of things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":null,"title":"instagram update new scroll left right sideways feature explained","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/01/20/instagram.jpg","title":"new instagram update revert back scrolling swipe left feed change feature","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide.

Most people know you can delete any of the images you’ve already posted, but not everyone is aware that you can also edit them.

This time around, almost everyone got the update within a matter of minutes. If people weren\u0027t seeing it when they opened their app, force quitting and scrolling around appeared to prompt the app to update.Why Instagram just completely changed its feedBut now some users report that the change has switched back, with the feed going upright all over again. It\u0027s not clear whether that is a bug – or whether the rollout itself had happened by accident, or early.Instagram had clearly meant for the update to go live at some point, since an instructional card popped up to explain that the change had been made and what users now had to do.There doesn\u0027t appear to be any way to make the feed change back. Instagram is not giving the option to revert to the old feed, even temporarily.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/28/01/michael-palin-getty.jpg","title":"new year honours 2019 michael palin knight culture full list","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

(RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Guitarist Gordon\u0026nbspGiltrap and singer turned voice coach David Grant\u0026nbspare both appointed\u0026nbspMBEs.

Markets have also been rocked by general global political and economic uncertainty: Donald Trump is said to be preparing to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, and the US government shutdown is set to continue into the new year. Government shutdown likely to extend into the new yearMichael Bloomberg warns the ‘beginning of the collapse’ has begunStock markets steady after worst Christmas Eve in Wall Street historyHowever, analysts are stumped as to exactly why markets have moved so dramatically in recent days, with Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia Pacific at Oanda Corp describing the situation as “completely bizarre”. “It’s incredible just how harmful markets veer when sentiment slides,” he added.Sean Fenton, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the movement was “certainly unusual for this time of year”, and noted that normally in December “you see people take holidays and sort of shutting up shop, not surges in volatility”.Wall Street’s recovery in the second half of this week has helped boost European and Asian markets, with the FTSE 100 rising 2.2 per cent on Friday. Meanwhile, the oil market is showing similar volatility off the back of supply uncertainty. US futures rose 2.6 per cent on Friday, having dropped 3.5 per cent on Thursday, and earlier in the week, the oil price plunged by 6.7 per cent on Christmas Eve, then recovered by almost 9 per cent in the next trading session. Makiko Tsugata, a senior analyst at Mizuho Securities, said more volatility lay in store for the commodity. “Oil markets, along with stock and bond markets, are expected to see higher volatility in 2019,” she said. “Investors view production cuts pledged by Opec and non-Opec as not enough to balance global supply and demand.”Additional reporting by newswiresOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31.

Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB.

Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

With ministers now promising a total of around 2,500 per year until 2022, it means the increased funding will deliver\u0026nbsponly an additional 1,000 each year.In contrast, 39,402 were built\u0026nbspin 2009-10 –\u0026nbspthe year before the Conservatives came to power.In October, Ms May announced that her government was increasing\u0026nbspfunding for the\u0026nbspAffordable Homes Programme by £2bn, taking the total to almost\u0026nbsp£9bn.Heralding the move, the prime minister said she was making it\u0026nbspher personal “mission” to tackle the housing crisis and assured those in need of\u0026nbspa better home that “help is on\u0026nbspthe way”.But in answer to a parliamentary question from Labour, housing secretary James Brokenshire said just one in 20 of the new homes to be built\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspbe social homes.\u0026nbspHe said: “The £9bn Affordable Homes Programme will deliver at least 250,000 homes by March 2022. At least 12,500 of these will be for social rent outside of London.“The Greater London Authority has the flexibility to deliver social rent in London.”Commenting on the revelation,\u0026nbspJohn Healey, Labour’s shadow housing secretary, said: “There’s been a disastrous fall in the number of new genuinely affordable homes for social rent under the Conservatives. We are now building over 30,000 fewer social rented homes a year than when I was Labour’s last housing minister in 2010.“Ministers’ flawed definition of ‘affordable housing’ includes homes for sale at up to £450,000 and to let at 80 per cent of market rents, so it’s just not good enough for ministers to only commit a tiny fraction of the affordable homes budget to new social rented homes. The next Labour government will build a million low-cost homes, the majority for social rent.”Addressing the Conservative Party conference in October, Ms May promised “a new generation of council houses to help fix our broken housing market”.She said: “In those parts of the country where need is greatest we will allow social rented housing to be built, at well below market levels, getting the government back into the business of building houses.”And during the 2017 election campaign, Ms May promised the Tories would deliver “a new generation of social rented homes”.44bn to supporting the housing marketHousing charities condemned the revelation\u0026nbspthat the\u0026nbspgovernment will only fund 2,500 new social homes per year.Greg Beales,\u0026nbspcampaign director of\u0026nbspShelter, said: “The gap between the number of social homes we need in this country and how many get built is vast. In fact, we delivered 84 per cent\u0026nbspfewer social homes this year than in 2010. This is totally unacceptable when hundreds of thousands of people are homeless and millions more are struggling in unstable and expensive private renting.\u0026nbsp“It is time the government charted a new course and seriously ramped up its efforts to get more social homes built. That’s why Shelter has launched an independent commission into the future of social housing that will soon set out a bold and far-reaching vision for the pivotal role it has to play in ending the housing crisis.”And Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said: “It is very disappointing to see such a tiny proportion of the properties to be delivered through the Affordable Homes Programme being made available for social rent. Research shows we need 90,000 social homes built every year for the next 15 years to meet demand – both for those experiencing homelessness, and for those on low incomes, many of whom are at risk of homelessness.“The current lack of genuinely affordable housing is leaving thousands living on a knife-edge, unable to keep up with spiralling rents and housing costs.”Kit Malthouse, housing minister, said:\u0026nbsp“Over the last three decades governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types, including for affordable and social rent.“We’re correcting this with massive investment in house building, including the £9bn affordable homes programme, but also by setting councils free to build the social homes their communities need.“We expect many thousands of new homes to result and we share the impatience of the British people to see decent homes built for the next generation.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Nine minutes und kounting!”Here in Brexit-crazed Westminster, that scene sounds all too familiar.There are now fewer than  days until we are scheduled to leave the European Union on March .As European Commission bigshots like to say: “The clock is ticking.”Heaven knows what is going to happen: Will British Prime Minister Theresa May — still alive, and even a little stronger than she was a couple of weeks ago — elicit assurances from Brussels that will help her sell her Withdrawal Agreement deal to a sceptical House of Commons Will pro-Remain MPs somehow force a second referendum that could stop Brexit  Will we sail out of the EU without a treaty The only thing anyone knows for sure is that this particular thriller must soon end.By March , we will knowthe villain has succeeded in his dastardly plot or  can again save the world.Because, let’s face it, we’re not going to let the baddie win.Pessimists tend to prosper in uncertain times, and British politics at present is very much a catastrophists’ market.Critics and doomsayers are agitating more noisily as the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal becomes more likely.We’re being told British shops will run out of food and medicines, aeroplanes will be grounded and the economy could shrink by as much as eight per cent that’s the Bank of England’s worst-case scenariowe leave the EU without a deal in place.Officials in both London and Brussels are talking publicly about contingency planning, while Labour and pro-EU Tory MPs have repeatedly pressed May to rule it out.In the last Cabinet meeting of the year, Work And Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd supposedly compared Brexit to a car crash and Justice Secretary David Gauke said the concept of a “managed no-deal” was as mythical as a unicorn.But doomsayers should hold their fire — Britain will be just fine.Evensome instability does follow a no-treaty withdrawal, it would be short-term. Le would continue. Chickens would continue to lay eggs.Trading restrictions work both ways, so any attempt by Brussels to punish the disobedient Brits by preventing them exporting agricultural goods to the EU might encourage the British government to find sudden reasons to stop the importation of German motor cars. Or Irish beef. Or French wine.Have you tried new-world merlots  They can be rather good. And good value.No-deal would, in fact, have tremendous advantages.It would allow Britain immediately to negotiate and sign trade deals beyond Europe.It would force May’s government to cut taxes to make us more competitive.It would result in a tremendous boost to national unity.Before the EU starts feeling too sorry for us — or too eager to see the back of us — it might consider that in the long term, it has far greater problems on the horizon than we do.When none of the doomsday Brexit predictions comes to pass, the EU will find itself in deep trouble — our survival, and success without the bloc, will highlight the intransigence of the Commission and may well tempt other EU members to contemplate quitting the troubled union.Because there’s no denying it is deeply troubled.Belgium’s government is in turmoil — yet again.France’s peacock president is having his feathers plucked by a bolshy populace.The German chancellor is soon to depart this political le.Italy and Brussels may have papered over their rancorous dispute over Rome’s spending proposals, but neither is likely to play nice for long.Spain has a hideous unemployment problem and poor Greece, the crucible of Western democracy, has lost control of its own affairs and is turning into a Third World country.Poland and Hungary, of course, are pursuing non-liberal policies that have earned them the contempt of the European institutions.And all this before we even start contemplating Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s hiccups.Britain’s political class may be in agony over a “Leave” instruction it resents, but the country’s electorate is markedly more relaxed.January and February  are likely to prove noisy in Westminster, but by the end of March — one way or another — we will be out.That James Bond countdown will end and our ab-dabs will start to abate.The EU’s nightmare, alas, will continue.The question in Britain will then not be “why did we leave ” but “why did it take us so long ”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, without our cash, the EU now realises there will be a massive black hole in their coffers.EU chiefs mistakenly thought they had us over a barrel and could use their leverage to get whatever they wanted.But they are now waking up to the fact that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is unlikely to get the nod and, with no deal legally our default position, a clean break looms.The refusal to give our PM any concessions does not look so wise now.The Sun has long questionedthe EU would ever prioritise their economies and citizens’ jobs over a zealous desire to punish Britain for leaving.Perhaps Mr Oettinger’s comments suggest that reality is finally dawning.IT is shocking that Britain has just TWO boats to police , miles of shoreline.Organised gangs are taking advantage of our easily penetrable coast to traffick desperate people who will risk their lives in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to get here.As many as  people have tried to cross over from France in just two months.

This should go to the UN Security Council now. It’s not just Nazanin, there are many Britons and Americans being held by Iran.“We should also raise it to the level of a formal dispute between Britain and Iran, which hasn’t happened yet. That would give Nazanin diplomatic protection.”Mr Hunt stepped up the verbal pressure on Tehran yesterday by branding its actions as “monstrous” and “totally unjust”.He also accused Iran of holding Brits like Nazanin prisoner as “a tool of diplomatic leverage”.The Foreign Secretary added: “Iran is a country which has a great civilisation behind it, one of the oldest civilisations in the world, they want to be respected by other countries - this is not the way to do it, to imprison an innocent woman like this”.The Government has previously insisted international sanctions on Iran’s defence ministry made it impossible for a deal to be done.But campaigners have insisted it could instead pay Iran’s central bank the money, which has already been set aside in a holding account.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every word of his tweet was correct — these men are sick, they are paedophiles and they are Asian.When politicians are condemned for telling the truth, for stating plain-as-day facts, you know we live in scarily censorious times.So, this week, Javid was right to turn down an invitation to “rethink” his October tweet.He was on the Today programme on Radio . A guest presenter — the British-Pakistani novelist Kamila Shamsie — asked himhe thought his tweet might have fuelled hate crimes. Coolly, and with rare principle, Javid said that of course politicians must be “careful with their language”.Butyou look at recent high-profile cases of gang-based sexual exploitation, “there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, he said.He’s right.Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Telford, Newcastle, Huddersfield . . . across England there have been awful grooming-gang cases, where the perpetrators have largely been Muslim men and the victims white working-class girls.We must be free to talk about this. To analyse it. To ask how such a terrible situation came about where vulnerable, mostly white girls are preyed upon by wicked, mainly Muslim men.But we are not free to talk about it. Anybody who raises the issue of Muslim grooming gangs risks being branded as foul, a racist, a troublemaker whose words will fuel hate crimes.Indeed, Javid has been subjected to genuine racist abuse for speaking out on the issue.Vile, hard-left tweeters have denounced him as an “Uncle Tom” and a “coconut”.Such disgusting racist insults reveal where the real prejudice lies in this debate — not in Javid’s concerned comments, but in the PC outrage that effectively says to him: “Shut up, Coconut.” Javid was not being prejudiced but many of the supposed progressives raging against him have been.It is all a sign of the times. From Conservatives such as Javid, to Labour MP Sarah Champion and radical feminists such as Julie Bindel, anyone who expresses concern about Pakistani-heritage grooming gangs can expect to be bombarded with abuse.But a nation that cannot discuss its communal tensions is a nation that is in very serious trouble.That signicant numbers of Muslim men are abusing signicant numbers of white working-class girls suggests “multicultural Britain” is a fractured, sometimes ugly place — and we must be at liberty to talk about this.Shushing debate about Muslim grooming gangs is insulting not only to the victims of those gangs, but to Britain’s Muslim community, too.It suggests they are too fragile, too weak, to cope with honest debate about problems and crimes within their communities.So let us be thankful for Sajid Javid — a politician who is willing to look modern Britain in the face and ask it some dficult but essential questions.This is a Tory to watch.Their latest wheeze is to force restaurants and supermarkets to impose “calorie caps” on their dishes.Public Health England is thinking about stopping supermarkets from selling sarnies that have more than  calories and capping restaurant meals at  calories. This would effectively mean using the power of the state to force us slovenly, greedy plebs to go on diets.It’s so paternalistic.Here’s a radical idea – bugger off and let people eat whatever they want.Our lunchtime triple-decker sandwich and occasional restaurant blowout are none of your business.TALK about a self-fulfilling prophecy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These moves are necessary and to be welcomed. But he must also tackle the causes. Migration is a fact of le. There are lots of reasons people flee their homelands. Syria, for example, is a warzone and many Syrians have lost everything. In desperation, thousands have headed for Europe. And, because gangs are exploiting their panic and fear, one of the most dangerous parts of the journey is near the end. Organised criminals offer them a leline, but at an unbelievable cost: cut-price deals to allow migrants to put their children on boats.   This is not just a couple of conmen chancing their arms.

Iranian Ahmad Lorpur, , has been living in a tent in Calais with his we and two children for four months while waiting for his chance to get to the UK. He told us: “You have to pay mafia to get on a boat. They are Iraqi-Kurds. “They call themselves ‘agents’, like travel agents. I have met one of them – a young Iraqi Kurd aged in his s. “He said he lives in England and that I needed to pay pound, each for me and my we to travel there. He said my children can go for half the price – pound,.” Standing with his kids Mariam, seven, and Benyamin, two, Ahmad added: “I have no money left now. It is all gone, butI had pound, I would pay it. “I paid ,to smugglers to get my family out of Iran and into Europe as we suffered persecution for being Christian. We managed to get here four months ago, but now we’re stuck. “It is no good for us here in Calais. My son is sick and we need help. “Everyone is waiting to get on boats to England. It is a big problem.”   An Iraqi-Kurdish refugee who is living at a camp  miles away, near Dunkirk, said desperate refugees contact smugglers through secret Facebook groups.The -year-old man, who lived in the north of England before being deported three years ago, asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He said: “The names of the Facebook groups regularly change and it is not obvious what they are unless you know about them.“But after you’ve private messaged them, and they’re satisfied you’re not police, they send an agent to meet you in person. It’s still very cloak and dagger.“Once they’re completely happy, they negotiate a deal and give you a number to contact them on a messaging app like Telegram so it’s secure – as well as details of a bank account number for you or a family member to pay the money to. “I cannot risk giving you the details of the Facebook group becausethey found out I would be in a lot of danger. “They have knives and guns. I’m worried they could be watching now.” French officials say the number of detected illegal Channel crossings was  in  but has soared  per cent this year. But in Calais those determined to reach the UK are undeterred. While hundreds are putting their lives at risk on boats, others are paying pound, to stow away on lorries.  In the latest sea incidents, an inflatable containing four migrants was rescued off the Kent coast at around am on Friday.Six hours later another small boat was intercepted with eight people on board.That came after nine people, including three children, were intercepted on a beach in Sandgate, Kent, on Thursday.And more than  migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day.   Ingrid Parrot, of the French Maritime Police, said extra patrol vessels had been deployed to avert a tragedy. She added: “The figures are unprecedented and very disturbing. The risk is great.“There are  ships and  ferries crossing here every day. What’s more, the currents are strong and the winds almost permanent.” A senior French police source added: “Iraqi Kurds play a major part in the people smuggling rackets.“They are putting lives at risk while profiting from human misery. It is only a matter of time until lives are lost.” Two years ago, UK-based Iraqi Kurd gangster Twana Jamal,  – nicknamed The Godfather – was jailed for five years for a poundmillion-a-year cross-Channel people smuggling racket. And in September, two Albanians and five Brits from Kent were jailed for a total of  years after using small boats and a jet ski to smuggle people into the UK.

Expert tips for a painless, tipple-free start to the new yearBrits drank a staggering  units of alcohol a week during the festive season and in January one in ten of us will aiming for a month offShareCommentsByRachel Spencer:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsInformation manager Alison Benson said she changed her le with Dry January\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe statics are quite shyfrightening andyou ever needed a reason to ease up on your booze intake, then now is the time – as Dry January is about to kick in. One in  adults – .million ofus – will have a month off the sauce, according to figures released by Alcohol Change UK. Many will have binged to excess over the festive period, when the average Brit drinks  units of alcohol a week. That’s nearly five times the  units recommended by the NHS. So taking part in Dry January will help you feel both healthier and wealthier. And banishing booze for four weeks can improve your relationship with alcohol in the long term. Dr Richard Piper, from Alcohol Change UK, explains: “Being alcohol-free for  days shows us that we don’t need alcohol to have fun, to relax, to socialise. “For the rest of the year we are better able to make decisions about our drinking and to avoid slipping into drinking more than we really want to.  “Many of us know the risks of alcohol – seven forms of cancer, liver disease, mental health issues – but we are often unaware that drinking less has more immediate benefits too.” Research carried out by the University of Sussex into  Dry January participants found their drinking days on average dropped from . to . per week, the units on each drinking day fell by nearly  per cent, and episodes of drunkenness went from . a month to .. Four out of five felt more in control of their drinking,  per cent saved money,  per cent slept better and realised theydidn’t need drink to have fun,while  per cent had moreenergy. Over half,  per cent, noticed an improvement in their skin and  per cent lost weight. Being booze-free helped in their professional lives too, with  per cent having improved concentration.  Alison Benson, , an information manager from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, did Dry January this year and hasn’t touched a tipple since. She said: “I didn’t know when to stop. I found myself in unsafe shysituations and there would be occasions when I’d wake up and didn’t know how I got home – or I’d wake up in strange places. “I found Club Soda, a support group for women who want to stop drinking or moderate theirintake, went to a workshop last November and tried alcohol-free drinks. “On New Year’s Eve I had my last drink and since stopping I’ve felt less anxious, more clear-headed, my sleep has improved – and I still enjoy social situations. I always say I may go back to drinking, but I’m in no hurry to. Dry January changed my le.” Lauren Booker, author of Try Dry, The Official Guide to a Month off Booze, has these tips:  Have a clearout It’s a lot harder to stick to Dry Januaryyou still have bottles of wine and crates of beer in the house. You don’t need to pour it down the drain. Either lock it away in the shed so you’re not tempted or ask a friendyou can leave it at their house until the end of the month.  Treat yourself If you drink a couple of bottles of wine at home and have one night out a week, that’s pound a month on booze. Go on a spa weekend or do something you really love instead. Don’t use the cash for anything mundane. The Dry Jan app shows how much you save.  Find an alternative to your favourite tipple There are alcohol-free wines and beers so find one that tastes as much like your usual drink so you don’t feel you’re missing out. Andyour tipple is a GT try an alcohol-free gin which has all the taste.   Exercise more Exercise releases those feelgood shyendorphins, and you’ll find you’re less sluggish when you kick booze.

And the tear-jerking verse has been turned into a book to help children facing similar tragedies. The project is part of the shyextraordinary legacy that Lisa Wells wants to leave her girls Ava-Lily, six, and one-year-old Saffia. Last December bubbly shybeautician Lisa was given the shattering news she had terminal cancer. Since then the inspirational -year-old has made the most of every day – despite having surgery and  rounds of chemotherapy to try to keep the cancer stable.   She said: “Every day I wake up and count my blessings I’m still here. “I never imagined I would live long enough to see my five-week-old baby grow into a -month-old with an amazing little personality. “I’ve seen her take her first steps, I’ve heard her say her first words. All these things I didn’t think I’d be here to see.” Comfort Lisa and husband Dan, , from Frome, Somerset, have not hidden her cancer from their eldest shydaughter, Ava-Lily, but have not told her it is terminal. Lisa said: “She knows there might come a day when I’m not here any more but that’s all we’ve said. “It’s the hardest thing to have to tell your child and it’s why I wanted to write the book. “It is a love letter from my heart with all the sentiments I want to leave my children to help them come to terms with my death. “I cry every time I read it but I’m so, so proud of it.   “I’ve had messages from other mums who bought the book to read with their children and wanted to thank me. “One lady said she’d been given two weeks to live and it was such a huge comfort to her. She has passed away now. “To know I’ve in some way helped another family means such a lot to me.” Lisa wrote the book, called Only one of Me, A love letter from Mum, with the help of shychildren’s author Michelle Robinson. It is being sold to raise money for the cancer counselling charity We Hear You and Mummy’s Star, which supports women and their families affected by cancer shyduring pregnancy. “Be a little bit like Mum,” Lisa writes at the end of her shyheart-rending letter. “Be kind! Be brave! Be free! Remember all our joy and fun when you remember me.” Lisa has kept a moving video diary charting her ups and downs, sharing the vlogs on her Lisa’s Army Facebook page. It has galvanised an army of supporters who have raised pound, for her children’s future. The mum has also been putting together a scrapbook for her daughters with photos and little notes about their precious time together. She said: “One of my biggest fears is that Saffia won’t remember me. So I want her to be able to see for herself who I was. “I’m doing everything I can to leave a trail for my girls. “They will be able to watch the shyvideos and hear my voice and they can read their scrapbooks and see how I wrote.”   Lisa had shown worrying symptoms of bowel cancer while expecting Saffia but her doctor put it down to her pregnancy. It was only after she had Saffia and lost three stone in six weeks that she was sent for a colonoscopy that shyrevealed cancer had spread to her liver and was inoperable. Today Lisa has already outlived her consultant’s prognosis, And she has made the most of the last year – doing things she never shyimagined possible. “I’ve been in a Boyzone video,” she laughed. “Ava and I met Ed Sheeran at one of his concerts. “I’m now a published author, I’ve turned on my town’s Christmas lights, there’s all the fundraising we’ve been doing. “When I’ve not been too sick from chemo I’ve just made the most of every day I’ve had with my family.” Lisa and road surfacer Dan – who have been shytogether since they were  – also ed in August to the stately home where they got married to renew their wedding vows on their tenth anniversary. She said: “I’ve learnt to enjoy every day rather than wasting time thinking that I might not be here much longer.” Lisa’s incredible courage has won her a string of gongs including the Crowdfunder of the Year prize at JustGiving’s annual awards ceremony. “All of this I never shyexpected,” she said. “One thing that shycancer has done to me is made me the person that I always should have been. “If I want to do something, I do it. “This last year has been the worst year of my le but also the best. “I thought  was definitely my last Christmas but here I am a year later and hopefully I will be here to see another one too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family tribute most incredible footballer","story":"NewsFamily tribute to most incredible footballer who died in car crashReis Farley-Hearn, , died in a collision on B Dunmow Road, Thaxted, Essex, on December ShareCommentsByTommy Wathen:,  DEC NewsMr Farley-Hearn was pronounced dead at the scene \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA footballer who died in a horror crash has been described as the most incredible man.Reis Farley-Hearn, , died when his vehicle was involved in a collision on B Dunmow Road, Thaxted, Essex at around .pm on December .Police responded to reports of a crash involving a white Mercedes van and a black Volkswagen, Essex Live reported .

Natasha Archer, who gave birth to a baby boy named Theo last week, was among those to be named in the Queens New Years Honours list which was revealed last night. The -year-old has been made a member of The Royal Victorian Order , which recognises distinguished personal service to members of the monarchs family. However, typically royal staff are given such an honour - dubbed the kiss of death by royal observers - when they leave their position. Although this is not always the case, it has now prompted speculation Ms Archer may leave her role, though no such move has been announced.  Royal blogger Gerts Royals shared the news of Ms Archers honour on Twitter sparking debate. One user responded by asking: So Natasha is leaving    Another said: This kinda confirms my suspicion that shell be leaving the team after the birth of baby Theo but well have to wait and see! A third praised Natasha for doing a wonderful job, while someone  said they dont want her to go.  Gerts Royals added: Royal staff are often given an honour when they leave. But its also common for staff members to get an honour after some years of service. And I think when someone is leaving they are typically given the honour after they leave. Not before. However the blogger later said: There has been no announcement that Natasha Archer is leaving. And getting a Royal Victorian Order does not necessarily mean you are leaving. A lot of staff just get one after a certain number of years.  The new mum has been working with the royal family since  and was originally Kates PA. In , she was promoted to Kates style advisor and was frequently spotted lugging around cases and suit bags on royal tours. She has played an important role in William and Kates lives - predominantly assisting the duchess with her style and travelling the world with the couple on official tours. She was spotted arriving at the Ludo Wing in St Marys Hospital following the birth of Prince Louis in April, to help the Duchess of Cambridge get ready for her public appearance. Last year, she tied the knot with world-renowned Getty royal photographer Chris Jackson after he proposed on a beach in Cornwall in .  As part of his role as a royal photographer for Getty, he regularly accompanies the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, the Cambridge family and Meghan and Harry on official engagements. Just  days ago, Ms Archer and Mr Jackson welcomed son Theo, who was born at Cha and Westminster Hospital in London on December . He announced the news on his Instagram account with a series of pictures of his newborn son and said he was the best present ever. He wrote: Could not be more proud of these two!! Absolute legends - I think this may be the best photo I’ve ever taken! Great to be home.  Meanwhile, Meghan is set to lose close aide Samantha Cohen in the spring, a palace veteran who has served the royals for  years and is dubbed Samantha the panther. Samanthas departure follows the recent resignation of Meghans personal assistant Melissa Touabti, who spent six months in the post. A source told the Sunday Times: Sam will be a huge loss.

The -year-old, who has previously suffered from mental health problems, branded the experience of temporary accommodation as traumatic. She claimed Nottingham council even tried to get her to move to Derby - miles from her daughters school. Despite the numerous set-backs, her daughter, Success, had a % attendance record last year. Ms Gardner said: My relationship broke down in London so I had to come back to Nottingham as I had nothing left down there. I could not cope. I ended up with housing aid as I was in rent arrears and I became isolated and depressed.  Research had to be done to seeI had made myself intentionally homeless and I went through three dferent hotels in the six months it took for them to make a decision - which came back that I had despite my relationship breakdowns. I was all alone with my daughter then, and housing aid sent me to Loxley House and said they could help me. At one stage, Gem and her daughter were forced to stay in a hotel that didnt have electricity for three days. She said: When I complained, they threatened to kick me out. Some landlords can be horrible to deal with and take advantage of your situation. The travel costs to get my daughter to school were so expensive as we kept getting put so far away.Ms Gardner eventually got a solicitor and said it is unfortunate there is not enough concern put into where vulnerable women are getting placed. The council has now helped her get a privately rented house in Hyson Green, Nottingham She also has a job after graduating in applied social science and youth work at university, looking after a child on a one-to-one basis at a school.  She added: Im an educated woman. My situation is not who I am. It has opened my eyes to the reality of the system. It seems designed to make people fail. Its not surprising how people fall into prostitution and drugs. But when I was alone in London I thought, I have to do this for my daughter. I am hoping to get a house with my own name on it. My daughter wants to be a clothes designer and shes already wanting to help other people as well. She has written a few cards for homeless people this year. Were in a better position now, but there is always the worry about going back there. Councillor Linda Woodings, portfolio holder for housing and planning at Nottingham City Council, said: This has been a complex case and we’re glad that we’ve ultimately been able to support Ms Gardner back into permanent accommodation.  She was living in a privately-rented property with her child and came to us after her landlord evicted her for non-payment of rent. It took a lot of work to understand what had happened in Ms Gardner’s case and why she had been unable to keep up with the rent. This involved conversations with a number of partner agencies and she was temporarily housed while this took place. The use of bed-and-breakfasts and hotels is clearly not ideal, and the council remains on track to end their use for families by the end of the year. Properties are only used when they have been assessed by our safer housing team as meeting required standards. Where we’ve had concerns, the council has taken appropriate steps to help the owner improve things. Enforcement action is taken where necessary. Unfortunately, there are often restrictions in providing temporary accommodation at city-based hotels over the weekend. We have occasionally been required to move people ahead of the weekend, but always try to get them back into the same hotel so that children’s schooling isn’t disrupted.

Dominique, who wants to warn others of the dangers how easy it is to cause a major chemical incident, had used two bottles of ‘One Shot’ toilet unblocker. Hours later she then poured bleach down the toilet, which she she thinks one of her young children blocked by putting too much toilet paper or a toy down there. “I put the kids to bed at pm, ran a bath, then looked in the toilet and it was still blocked so I thought ‘I’m not getting into the bath like this’, she said. I’ll put my three-litre tub of bleach down there, that should do it. But the bleach mixed with the toilet unblocker still in there causing a chemical reaction and released huge quantities of chlorine gas.  “I have never experienced fumes like it,” Dominique said. “My throat and eyes feel burned.” Dominique quickly shut the bathroom door and opened the windows around the house. However, the chlorine gas began to spread and she sought help from a neighbour and rang the fire brigade, who instantly realised how serious the situation was.The family didn’t get back to bed and sleep until am the following morning. Dominique posted the story on Facebook and shared her embarrassment at having to call out the firefighters, but said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others not to do the same. While the reaction from her friends was one of concern - and a degree of humour - the incident could have been very serious, and many commented that they also had no idea that mixing two normal household materials could effectively create a poisonous gas cloud. “It was really serious,” she said. “We are all ok, but it was the dumbest thing I have ever done - please don’t do this!” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents tell hope tiny tots","story":"NewsParents tell of hope for tiny tots born into the UKs leading neonatal unitSPECIAL REPORT: The NHS youngest and smallest patients arrive here and their fate is in the hands of a team of miracle workersShareCommentsByMartyn Halle:,  DEC NewsLittle baby boy Kayden was born  weeks early and is one of the tiny fighters at Southampton Children’s Hospital \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHis eyes are shut, he is connected to a raft of tubes and wires, but look at his tiny hand… seemingly raised in a gesture of hope. Baby Kayden lies peacefully in the incubator which has been home since his premature arrival into the world last month at just  weeks. Mum Melayne Pragnell is close by, reassured by the wonderful care Kayden is receiving in the state-of-the-art neonatal intensive care unit at Southampton Children’s Hospital. This is where the NHS’s youngest and smallest patients are fighting for their lives – their fate in the hands of medics who perform miracles on a daily basis. Often the tots’ skin is so thin you can see through it. They are clinging on to a le that has only just begun. Last week, the Sunday Mirror was invited to visit the unit as figures show , babies – seven per cent of all UK births – arrive prematurely each year. The atmosphere is calm, professional, yet warm and friendly too. Doctors, nurses and parents talk in hushed tones because noise could hinder recovery.  An illuminated ear on the wall goes from green to amber to red to showthere’s too much noise. It is a peaceful environment of darkened rooms. Incubators are covered by towels so that the still immature eyes of their little occupants aren’t startledthe lights are turned on. Care home worker Melayne, , wasn’t due to have her baby until mid-February. She and partner Kevin McDonough, , had been trying for children for  years and endured three cycles of IVF. But in mid-November Kayden was delivered weighing just g – .lbs – after Melayne developed a shycondition called placenta previa and suffered a potentially le-threatening bleed. Tiny Kayden made good progress, but suddenly declined  days ago after developing a potentially deadly E.coli tummy bug, then sepsis and meningitis. Doctors were on hand to respond quickly and are hopeful he will make a full recovery. Kevin said: “One minute we felt we were on the home straight – he was breathing by himself and things were looking up for Christmas. Then we were faced with a situation where he might be dead by Christmas.  “The doctors were very quick with their antibiotics. They put him to sleep and then put him on a ventilator.” Consultant and mum-of-four Victoria Puddy is one of the best in the field. Since she started  years ago, shyenormous strides have been made. Victoria said: “Now we are saving babies at  weeks when a decade ago we wouldn’t have considered rescuing a child so young. And we are not just saving them, some are leaving here unscathed.” Just five per cent of premature babies are born before  weeks. At  weeks, like Kayden,  per cent survive. Medics at Southampton are also caring for the daughter of a newly-appointed colleague. Abhijit Bhattacharaya, , had been working on the unit for just a week when his we Himakshi, also , went into labour at  weeks. Abhijit said: “I knew things were not good when my boss from neo-natal intensive care came into the theatre. “Our daughter Neysha was not breathing and they took her away and worked on her for  minutes before she started breathing. We are so, so grateful for their expertise.” As Abhijit spoke his we gently cradled Neysha’s hand. And just a few feet away lay another premature baby – tiny Sarah George, born at  weeks to parents Basil, , and Simi, . Doctors are using steroids and oxygen to help her lungs develop. The -cot unit is a centre of expertise when it comes to paediatric heart and neuro surgery. Consultants will even operate on the tots in their cotthey are too fragile to be moved. Like NHS staff nationwide, the team here is dedicated to its work.

HMV – which was rescued from administration in  – blamed rising business rates and music streaming. Executive chairman Paul McGowan said: “Even an exceptionally well-run and much-loved business such as HMV cannot withstand the tsunami of challenges facing retailers over the last  months on top of a dramatic change in consumer behaviour.” He pointed out that HMV sold  per cent of physical copies of music in the UK in  and  per cent of all DVDs and Blu-ray discs.  Its market share grew month by month throughout the year. Mr McGowan added that the market was set to fall by another  per cent next year so it was not possible to carry on. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: “It has been a tough year for many retailers, with many well-known brands disappearing from our high streets.” Administrators for HMV, which has , staff, are keeping all  stores open as they try to find a buyer for the chain. Shops will accept gt cards while it is trading. The last time the chain collapsed, administrators told customers gt vouchers would not be honoured but made a U-turn after an outcry. Will Wright, of KPMG, said: “Gt cards will be honoured while the business continues to trade.”  Clf: Its a disaster Sir Clf Richard says streaming is killing songwriting and is a “disaster” for the music industry. Sales of digital music provided by s such as Amazon and Spoty overtook physical formats for the first time in  and have continued to grow. But the profit share means writers get a fraction of what they earn from CDs and vinyl.  Sir Clf, , said: “With the streaming situation, I think an artist is lucky to get . of a cent. If people aren’t buying records and they are only streaming it’s a bit of a disaster for our industry.” He told radio station LBC singers can still earn from live work but writers do not have that luxury.

From royal protocol to royal traditions, they can walk you through just about anything to do with the Queen and her relatives. If that werent enough, theyre also really good at coming up with interesting theories about the royals and their behaviour. Their latest theory comes after the release of the New Years Honours list and is all to do with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  People on social media are speculating that Prince William and Kate Middletons personal assistant, Natasha Archer might soon be leaving royal le behind. This is because she was included in the Queens New Years Honours list for , in which she was made a member of The Royal Victorian Order . The Royal Victorian Order is a knighthood that dates back to  and was created by Queen Victoria, it intends to recognise distinguished personal service to the monarch of the Commonwealth realms, or members of the monarchs family. Typically royal staff are given such an honour when they leave their position.  Royal blogger Gerts Royals shared the news of Natashas honour on Twitter, sparking debate about what it really means for her future. One user responded by asking: So Natasha is leaving    Another said: This kinda confirms my suspicion that shell be leaving the team after the birth of baby Theo but well have to wait and see! A third praised Natasha for doing a wonderful job, while someone  said they dont want her to go.  Gerts Royals added: Royal staff are often given an honour when they leave. But its also common for staff members to get an honour after some years of service. And I think when someone is leaving they are typically given the honour after they leave. Not before.

The only exercise I have managed to do is hoist my legs off the floor and on to the sofa.The only weights I have managed to lt is that of the remote control. And the crisp bowl. My Dancing on Ice training took an especially big hit on Christmas Day – I am definitely one of those people who consumed a staggering average of , calories on the th, according to research. And I don’t get where that figure comes from – how can some turkey, a bit of booze and a few chocolates and Christmas pud add up to that  And that’s the problem, isn’t it  Obesity – and the strain our unhealthy lestyles put on the NHS – is on the rise.But while most of us know the dference between healthy and junk food, when it comes to knowing the calories in food, we are literally stuffed. And it’s the hidden calories manufacturers sneak in that bug me the most. I consider myself a smart and informed person who is totally aware and fully responsible for the choices I make in my le.I understand that, in order for me to lose weight, I have to consume fewer calories than I burn, no matter what diet I’m on.And I get that the daily requirements for a healthy woman is to consume , calories per day. But I am not a nutritionist, I am a busy working mum – and quite frankly I just don’t have the time or the inclination to work out how many calories are in the food I eat.And evenI think I’m making a healthy choice, that’s not always necessarily true... and here come the hidden calories, sneaking their way on to my hips.  Losing weight is not just about personal discipline, it is also about those in the food industry – shysupermarkets, pubs, restaurants and even schools – informing the public in a very simple, clear manner exactly how many calories are in their products. So I welcome Public Health England’s recommendation that there should be a calorie cap on ready meals, supermarket sandwiches and restaurant items. Chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said: “These are early days in the calorie-reduction programme, but the food industry has a responsibility to act.” What this means is they will have to revamp recipes and rethink meal offerings.The recommendations include a cap of cals on ready meals,  on restaurant mains and , on pizzas. It’s about time too. These big manufacturers have to take responsibility. They have a moral obligation to stop adding unnecessary calories in the form of sugar and fat. Why do you need to add sugar to a slice of chicken   Stealthy ways to make our food more palatable has led to sugar addiction, which causes obesity.I’m not buying excuses from manufacturers that these caps are “unrealistic” – that screams they can’t be bothered and don’t want to spend money. In this fight against obesity, everyone has to do their bit – self-discipline can only go so far. Manufacturers have to start putting morals before profits and appreciate they they play an integral part in the nation’s health.

So who should we be looking to give us a bit of hope for the  months ahead  Who will provide some inspiration to restore our faith in human decency  On my daily BBC news show I am regularly reminded what incredible people make up our country. Distance runner Sophie Power competed in one of the world’s toughest races, the km Ultra-Trail Du Mont Blanc – and breast-fed three-month-old son Cormac on the way round. The image of her doing that went global and on my programme she said: “When we become mums our self-identity doesnt change. We shouldn’t have to lose who we were before we were mothers.”   In February football coach and serial abuser of young boys, Barry Bennell, was sentenced to  years in jail for his crimes. Gary Clfe, Chris Unsworth, Steve Walters and Andy Woodward appeared on my programme to tell their horric stories. They could teach any one of us about courage, because that’s what it took for them to come forward after decades to speak out and testy against their abuser. Sophie and those men didn’t give up. Neither does Marie Gentles – the principled, firm, kind head of a pupil referral unit in East London who allowed our cameras into her school. Many of her students have been excluded from mainstream primaries yet she refuses to believe they are “naughty children”, simply that they’ve made poor choices. Marie and her staff give them another chance – and in most cases, help them turn their lives around. Maybe Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Vince Cable and other political leaders could learn from the inspiring people I’ve met this year – having courage, never giving up, showing compassion, and doing what’s right and just.

Taking to Reddit, the man starts his story by revealing that earlier in the year AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit and for some reason he thought it would be a great gt, so he bought six of them - one for himself, his mum, his dad, brother and two sisters. However when it came time to open presents on December , the kits didnt exactly garner the reaction hed been hoping for. He wrote: As soon as everyone opened their gt, my mom started freaking out.

Federation president Angel Lopez Maraver described his behaviour as “despicable.” He added: “We defend sustainable hunting and condemn the cruelty of this inidual.” PACMA, the Animalist Party Against Mistreatment of Animals which wants to ban hunting, tweeted: “Are these the types of people who look after nature and guarantee a balance in our ecosystem  “It’s time this violence stopped in our countryside.”  One animal rights campaigner reacted to the horric footage by writing on social media: “Am I the only person who would like to have this monster beside me with a baseball bat in my hand and hit him till I have pins and needles  “I don’t support violence but seeing this video, and feeling my blood boiling like I do now, it’s the only thing I want to do right now.” Another added: “My heart bleeds at such human cruelty. You have to be a real son of a bitch to do something like this.” It was not immediately clear on Friday how the footage came to light or where it was taken. The video was made public by Galician activist and naturalist Marcos Irua. PACMA has urged anyone with information on the hunter’s identy to contact the Civil Guard. Last month a dozen dogs and a deer were filmed plunging off the side of a clf during a hunt in Spain.  Animal welfare lobbyists attacked the hunter for sending his dogs to trap the wild animal as they shared the footage on social media. The incident happened near the village of Herreruela in the western province of Caceres. An onlooker could be overheard yelling to the hunter: “Run, the dogs are falling” as the first three went over the edge while the others tore at the deer. He repeated his warning as the dogs’ owner appeared, shouting out to him: “Run, three dogs have already fallen”, although the hunter failed to pick up his pace and ambled over to the pack of animals before appearing to make a botched attempt at finishing off the deer by stabbing at it with a kne. Several more dogs plunged to the bottom of the clf, followed by the deer, as he moved back, making a loud noise as they crashed to the ground.

We need to give them something to prey on.“We’re getting into good areas out wide but the final ball is either too much or not beating the first man.#He added: #We know what we will get from St Johnstone, it will be another tough game, like Livingston.“I just hope we have turned a corner now.“I felt we looked solid, we worked for each other, filling in for each other and it was enjoyable to play in that game.“The three before Wednesday weren’t great but that was back to our old selves.”In the past three seasons, it’s been all level in the battles between the top-flight’s Tayside teams with four wins apiece in the last eight.And the -year-old expects yet another close encounter.He said: “It’s been mixed against St Johnstone for us lately.“Tommy Wright’s brought in some good players and they are doing well this season.“Nearly every season you say that – you think they are going to hit a blip but they just don’t.“They can grind out results but they’ve been playing good football as well and can mix it up.“It will be tough and we need to be at it.”After defeats to Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic, McGowan feels the point against Livingston on Boxing Day is a step back in the right direction.“We earned a clean sheet from a tough game – Livi kept launching balls and we had to stand up and be counted,” he said.“I felt we did that well but we lacked the cutting edge, the final ball when getting into good areas. It’s a step back in the right direction and, hopefully, be a good point in the end.“Livingston’s gameplan was to go direct and put balls into the box to make things hard for us but I felt we stood up to it very well, I can’t think of them having a clear chance.“A draw was probably a fair result but I felt we were the better team.Hopefully, it’s a good point come the end of the season.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c1cc286b0142-458x564.jpg ","title":"takeover talk was none of our business says dundee united defender","story":"Defender Callum Booth says the Dundee United takeover and the speculation in the run-up to it was never a big topic of conversation in the dressing-room.And the full-back admits there was much more gossip in the squad after Csaba Laszlo’s departure at the end of December.However, he concedes what new American owner Mark Ogren does once the transfer window opens next week will be grabbing the attention of him and his team-mates.“I would say we were more focused on the speculation surrounding the club when we didn’t have a manager,” said the -year-old former Partick Thistle man.“Then that was what all the players were talking about. It was ‘who do you think it’s going to be  I’ve heard this or that’ and stuff like that.“I think with regards to the owners or the chairman, we don’t really see them that much on a day-to-day basis.“And the club has been running along smoothly, so it was not something we were speaking about too much.“There was a lot of talk about it in the week or so leading up to the takeover being confirmed last week, so it was mentioned but not all that much to be honest.”Now, though, Booth is keen to see just how much Minnesota-based Ogren is going to give manager Robbie Neilson to further strengthen the squad for the second half of the season.“January and the transfer window is coming and it will be interesting what happens, though it’s hard to say what will. We’ll get a view of the chairman’s ambition then and see what he does.“For us, Mike Martinwas a great guy but we didn’t see him too much and it will be the same with the new owner. We’ll talk about it a little bit but not too much and we just concentrate on the games coming up.”That focus on games made Booth well aware of the importance of United getting a win when Falkirk visited last Saturday.He believes the three points taken from that - victory were vital.“Obviously we’d not won in three games, so it was vital to get back to winning ways, especially at home.“Our last home performance against Ayr was disappointing, so it was huge to get the three points and I thought we played well and created a load of chances.“We probably should have been at least - up by the time injury time came and we gave away the penalty they scored from.“We were a bit slack for it and it meant the last few minutes were kind of ‘oh no’, but we managed to hold out pretty comfortably in the end and deserved the win.“It should have been dead and buried before that and I was really disappointed at not getting the clean sheet because we had defended really well during the game.“Overall, it was a good performance and a good win. We created good openings and we need to learn from that and put away more chances when we’re creating them like we did.”Booth also believes it was important United got back to imposing their passing game on teams again, just as they’d done in the draw at Inverness a week earlier.“That’s two good performances in a row. Four points from a home game against Falkirk and a trip to Inverness is not a bad .“We had a little dip and the Ayr United game took us by shock.“We didn’t really recover the week after down at Morton where it was a pretty poor performance but we feel back on track and long may it continue.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c23494787682.jpg ","title":"wasted emergency services spent a fortnight attending hoax calls","story":"Tayside#s emergency fire and ambulance crews have spent nearly a fortnight responding to hoax calls over the past four years, the Tele can reveal.Hundreds of calls have been made to both services which have led to a turn-out of staff, only for them to find it was malicious.Firefighters have spent more than , minutes – a total of  hours or more than  days – responding to such incidents since -.The majority of those calls involved fire alarms being activated deliberately, but they have also attended  reports about dangerous buildings, crashes and people in distress.In -, crews spent more time attending hoax calls than any of the previous two years, at more than , minutes.Between April and November this year, the figure stood at , minutes.Terry Whyte, local representative for the Fire Brigades Union , said crews are working hard to inform children about the implications of making   calls.He said: “The FBU has been working with the fire and rescue service to try to drive this down.“It’s down to education, such as going into schools and teaching kids about how important it is.“Our officers could be tied up with something  when there is a much more serious incident going on where.“We are constantly out speaking to kids about the dangers of making these kind of calls.“If there’s a specic area that we’re getting these calls from, then we’ll go out to it.“We certainly won’t be slowing down in trying to stop it happening for good.”Meanwhile, paramedics in Tayside have also been on the receiving end of malicious calls – most frequently in Dundee.Ambulance staff in the city have spent a total of , minutes responding to hoax calls since - – equal to about  hours, or more than two days. vw, px\"  And figures suggest that - is on track to be the worst year of the last four – with more than  minutes already spent on hoax incidents since April, more than the whole of - and just short of figures from - or -.Callers have ly reported patients having breathing problems, traumatic injuries, chest pains, burns, drowning and even stabbing or gunshot wounds, during their malicious calls.A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: “Anyone who calls  without a genuine need is potentially putting lives at risk by tying up valuable resources that could be needed for a le-threatening call.“When appropriate, malicious or nuisance callers are reported to the police.“However, in many cases, the call is a result of a social issue rather than malice and the patient may still need assistance.“In these cases, the relevant agencies are advised so appropriate care can be provided.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We condemn hoax calls to our emergency services.

They are on a roll.\"Inverness economist Tony Mackay said he hoped Brexit would not prove a stumbling block.\"There has been a big increase in European visitor numbers to Inverness and the Highlands because of the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote,\" he said. \"KLM have obviously benefited from that. I also believe that many business passengers to or from overseas prefer to fly via Amsterdam rather than Heathrow or Luton.\"One note of caution, however, is the possible adverse impact of Brexit once it takes effect.

has no cure.Jo and Stuart Thorburn, from Turrf, were devastated to find out that their first baby Caleb had cystic fibrosis .The genetic condition affects the lungs, digestive system and other organs and affects the cells that produce mucus and sweat.Stuart, , a field supervisor offshore and keen rally driver, said sharing their experiences with family and friends had helped them deal with the devastating diagnosis.Caleb, who is five months old, is now on constant medication to help him combat potential infections that could damage his lungs.Since the diagnosis, Stuart has embarked on a £, fundraising drive for the Butterfly Trust, a charity which helps families throughout Scotland with CF-related issues.So far he has raised £, for the Butterfly Trust through motor sport rally events.And, thanks to his friends, a charity boxing night before Christmas raised more than £,, taking him close to his £, target.Stuart said the diagnosis came out of the blue when Caleb was just three weeks old.He said: “When we were in hospital after Caleb was born everything was fine and everything was happy.“They do a blood test to check for the nine major conditions and CF is one of them.“After three weeks the nurse phoned our house and askedwe were in and that they needed to come see us.”He said the news “devastated” them both and had repercussions for other people in their family.“I didn’t know anything about cystic fibrosis,” Stuart said.“We had to tell our family andanyone was trying for a baby they had to stop because CF runs in the family.“After we found out, for a week or two I was kicking myself. Neither of us knew we were carriers of CF.“I was quite angry and depressed with the whole situation.”However, since learning of the diagnosis, Jo, Stuart and Caleb have been helped by the Butterfly Trust, as well as family and friends.Although the condition currently has no cure, thanks to breakthroughs in medicine it can be managed.Stuart says despite having CF Caleb is a normal baby boy.“He is a bit heavier than an average baby – lbs – and he’s quite heavy for a CF baby because normally they struggle to put on weight because they don’t get as many nutrients.“He’s on medication just now which helps him to digest food. Every CF person has to take it with their meals.“He’s always smiling. He is really strong.“He isn’t crawling yet but he’ll stand up on his own and have this massive grin.“He also has this bouncer that my mum and dad got him and he loves that.“We can put him in it for hours and he’ll bounce like mad and have loads of energy.“It does help with CF, the more he can punish his lungs the better.“A lot of people with CF will do swimming or marathons and do as much as they can to help with the condition.“Lungwill go down every year butCF people can look after their lungs and eat the right food it can be managed.” vw, px\"  Stuart offered advice to other parents who might be dealing with a CF diagnosis.He said: “Try not to stress about it too much.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 48","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCongratulations are due to a number of local people this week.We#re surrounded by heroes every day, most of whom are unsung, but David MacInnes was quite rightly recognised last week for his work in boosting the cause of stem cell research and donation.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

For myself, it has two principal components.The first is light. Most societies had and have a celebration of light at the darkest time of the year. It is a pattern followed by most of the world#s great religions.The religious reference is not only to the physical darkness of the sun being below the equator, but also the psychological darkness caused by uncertainty, loss, suffering of the body or the mind, broken relationships and the brokenness of many lives.By allowing the light of Christ to shine into our lives and bring comfort, guidance, courage, strength, we can change direction, start again and have cause for celebration.The second aspect is of birth. It really does not matter where or when Jesus was born. As Paul writes: #Jesus was born of a woman#, as we all were. The birth of a child, the gt of le, with all the potential each child has to become fully themselves.Jesus#s birth was no more or no less important to Mary and toThis time of year gives us the opportunity to celebrate le and perhaps, as the years pass and we look back, to reflect on how we have used our gts and talents.Is the world a better place because I we have walked this way  Is the world a better place because the Christ has walked this way If you are together as family, be happy together. Le is too valuable to spoil a celebration. If you are alone, I trust there are folk around you who will share with you.Whoever you are, may the light and the love of Christ#s coming bless you as you journey.PIC:Reverend Dr Roderick Campbell. _aRevCampbellAs isional commander, I sincerely hope this very special time of year is one that is fun-filled, enjoyed by all, and everyone is kept safe.It’s also a time for reflection. For my own part, I’m amazed at how quickly the year has passed.  has been a satisfying year as our strong local partnerships with our local authorities and other service providers have been built on to ensure close collaboration as problems arose.This approach delivered on our shared priorities to enhance the lives of iniduals in need of our support, and continued to nurture a safe and thriving environment for inidual and community wellbeing.We have faced several signicant challenges, not least the ‘Beast from the East’ extreme winter that caused such disruption across the country.During this Year of Young People, I am proud that the ision has continued to lead the way in Police Scotland in our innovative deployment of Youth Engagement Officers.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

South Ayrshire ruling councillors in the SNP and Labour rejected a plan to build an underpass at Doonfoot in Ayr. But SNP Councillor Siobhian Brown defied her party to turn against their decision and call it in. In front of a packed council chamber, the Doonfoot politician spoke out against the Leadership Panel vote to install a Toucan crossing instead. She said: “Public safety is at stake here. I urge the  to send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking at the Audit and Governance Panel,she said: “I oppose the amendment on the strongest terms.” A police officer at the meeting backed her up saying the crossing and a mph zone extension would be unsafe. Citing a speeding concern, the police recommended an underpass as well. The Ayrshire Roads Allianceis also in favour of the underground crossing.  ARA head Stewart Turner said: “The best option is the underpass.” During a leadership  meeting last month, Councillor Ian Cochrane put forward an amendment for the crossing and mph extension. It deviated roads department recommendations to get planning consent for the subway this financial year. As a result external funding, which was available for the underpass, would go unused. Tory Councillor Hugh Hunter questioned SNP Councillor Cochrane on why he made the amendment. Councillor Cochrane said he had meant the Toucan crossing to be installed quickly while plans were being made to progress the underpass. The meeting heard how the Leadership Panel minutes did not reflect that. Councillor Hunter said: “The only thing we can do is send this back to the Leadership Panel.” Speaking after the meeting, he added: “There is utter confusion in the Leadership Panel. I was astonished at that. It is a no brainer. What possessed people in a position of leadership to reject advice from the police and the roads department. It beggars belief. They turned down half a million pounds of external funding. There would be no defencesomeone died at that crossing.”  The Panel agreed to send it back to Leadership. Dozens of people donned visitor passes to pack into County Hall for the debate. Keen cyclist Clive Drummond said: “We are pleased that the council have directed the Leadership Panel to reconsider their decision to install a controlled crossing instead of an underpass at Dunure Road, Doonfoot.” He thanked people for firing off  emails to councillors to voice support for the underpass. He also thanked the Ayrshire Roads Alliance, Police Scotland and Councillor Siobhian Brown. Clive, of the South Ayrshire Paths Initiative , added: “SAPI hope the Leadership Panel will avoid further delay and move forward with construction of the underpass, which we believe is the only safe option to link the increasingly popular cycle paths.” He said the end result will be a “safe, easy to use, pleasant five mile walking and cycling route between Alloway and Ayr harbour. The issue was set to be brought back in front of the Leadership Panel yesterday .

And the health board have been asking young interns with additional support needs, and no training, to deal with the problem. Pictures seen by the Standard show dozens of ‘sharps’ boxes filled with hypodermic needles stacked up in full view of the public at a number of sites.  They also show hundreds of rubbish bags bursting from containers with incontinence pads, fluid bags, and materials soaked in blood and other bodily fluids not securely contained. That’s despite medical waste having to be dealt with under the strictest of safety and hygiene conditions. Now Chief Executive John Burns has been forced to issue reassurances to staff and the public, saying the problem had been “addressed immediately”.The Standard can exclusively reveal the extent of the problem faced by waste management operatives on a daily basis, with unions raising “grave concerns” at their exposure to a number of serious health risks. A dossier of evidence submitted to health bosses from UNISON showed project SEARCH interns had been tasked with dealing with the specialist problem. The project helps those aged  to  with additional needs – including those on the autistic spectrum – gain work experience and placements. In his submissions to senior management, Robert Rae, UNISON regional organiser, said the youngsters had been “primarily placed” to deal with disposal tasks. Mr Rae added: “We are calling upon John Burns to take immediate action to address the serious concerns we have with regards the potential risk to safety and wellbeing of staff and patients within NHS Ayrshire and Arran.  “Our members and the patients they serve should not be exposed to any potential risk of infection or injury due to the shambolic way the current waste crisis throughout the UK has been dealt with in NHS Ayrshire and Arran this past week.” Images show orange and yellow bags marked ‘clinical waste for alternative treatment or incineration’ overflowing from container cages at Crosshouse, Ayr and Ailsa hospitals. Another shows ‘sharps’ boxes piled up on top of an industrial freezer next to staff lockers. Cages containing ‘sharps’ boxes, cytotoxic, and used drug vials with the remnants of drugs, can be seen next to a perimeter fence with high banking, meaning anyone could lean over and access the boxes. Glass drugs vials, blood, incontinence pads, and other medical waste can also be seen on the ground.UNISON have raised concerns with the training, protocols, and risk assessments being applied to the disposal and handling of waste.

Mr Rae added: “A supervisor was unable to advise of the procedure or cleaning agents used to clean this. “It is also concerning that the supervisor himself, when questioned, was unable to provide information on how spillages should be dealt with. “Staff have not been informed nor advised that they should be changing out of their work clothes which are clearly being exposed to spillages and they are travelling home in this clothing.

In recent months, the town has seen a spike in thefts, with  recorded last month. And residents at Girvan Community Council raised questions over the lack of CCTV along Dalrymple Street. Now council bosses have confirmed that a replacement has been ordered to be installed in the next few weeks due to the current cameras nearing their ‘operational le’. A spokesman said: “Due to intermittent issues with CCTV in Dalrymple Street we recently carried out repairs to make sure our Emergency Response Team can monitor the area  hours a day. “However, given the camera is now nearing the end of its operational le, and to make sure the system is fully fit for purpose, we’ve ordered a replacement which is due to be installed in the next few weeks. Cllr Alec Clark believes that the new installation of the CCTV cameras is a win-win for the Girvan community. He said: “It is fantastic - I think it has highlighted the fact that when we had the incidents of vandalism, how important CCTV is for protecting our town centres. “I’m glad that the ones we have are ing, but more to the point - I am really delighted that the new CCTV is on the way. “I think it is a win-win situation for the community of Girvan.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"school becomes single campus two","story":"NewsSchool becomes single campus as two main parts join upThe transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House.ShareByStephen Houston:,  DEC NewsWellington school is now a single campus \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe two main parts of Wellington School have become one. The transformation of an old lodge house on the site in Ayr’s Seafield has joined the existing mansion buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. Headmaster Simon Johnston opened the new building, called Craigweil Lodge, last week. He believes it is a signicant step and provides extra classroom space and better single campus. He said: “It provides us with additional accommodation of the highest quality, but it also forges a link between the existing buildings of Carleton Turrets and Craigweil House. “Wellington now has a single, coherent campus and the development potential of this wonderful seafront site has been well and truly unlocked.” The school is working in partnership with architects Austin-Smith: Lord on a long-term masterplan for the campus and this is very close to publication.  The new Lodge contains an additional P classroom and this year the school has three P classes for the first time. It also contains an additional social studies classroom, a staff work room and an attractive new Support for Learning Hub. Equally signicantly pupils will be able to move freely between buildings without having to go out onto the public pavement along Craigweil Road. Jenner Simpson, Board of Governors chairman,has been instrumental in developing the plans for expansion. She said: “We cannot afford to stand still and the board are continually looking at ways to move the school forward. The opening of the Lodge is one step in many that the board are currently working towards and we are looking forward to unveiling the other plans that we have been working on very soon.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

However, the change in use had gone unnoticed by Scottish Borders Council, until concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received a notice from the council outlining its grievances. It reads: ldquoIt appears to the council that a breach of planning control has occurred within the last ten yearsldquoIn terms of the character of the property, the house, while having nine bedrooms is advertised as being able to accommodate - guests, with the master bedroom being advertised with six double beds along with another of the bedrooms being advertised as having four double beds, which is not normally found in a residential property.ldquoThe characteristic of the use, where guests are generally visiting for a short period of time, and the numbers of guests being accommodated, has led to an increase in late night activity and disturbance within the area, to the detriment of the neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoAs stated above the use is having a detrimental impact on residential amenity, with regular reports of late night disturbances being made to ious council departments, including environmental health and the anti-social behaviour team as well numerous complaints to Police Scotland.Mr Cameron has subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.Acting on Mr Cameronrsquos behalf, Edinburgh-based solicitors MHD Law have submitted an appeal statement to the DPEA.It reads: ldquoIt is alleged in the notice that a lsquomaterial change of usersquo of the property has taken place.ldquoHowever, Mr Cameron has been using the property as accommodation for short stay visitors since , and so for over ten years. In terms of the town and country planning act, no enforcement action may be taken by the local authority lsquoafter the end of the period of  years beginning with the date of the breachrsquo.ldquoMr Cameron therefore submits that the local authority is now barred from taking enforcement action, given that the use of the property as accommodation for short stay visitors has been in place for more than the period of ten years specied there.ldquoThe planning enforcement notice says that the use of the property for short term visitor stays lsquois having a detrimental impact on residential amenity.ldquoMr Cameron had been made aware of neighbour complaints and so reasonably assumed thathe addressed the causes of activities giving rise to those complaints he could reassure the council he was taking the matter seriously and minimising the impact of the behaviour complained of.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.However, the council has not backed down, and in their own submission to the Scottish Government, council planning officers state that because Mr Cameron still used the lodge as his main residence until , the ten year limitation on change of use enforcement had not come into effect.Ron Kirk, Scottish Borders Councilrsquos managing solicitor, wrote to the DPEA: ldquoBy his own admission, as set out in his e-mail to the council on  September , theappellant confirms that the property was still being used as a main residence up to a period of time within .ldquoThe council respectfully submits that an uninterrupted period of use could not have been established whilst the property was still the appellantrsquos main residence and therefore the relevant trigger point for the ten year period in terms of the town and country planning act was the date in  when the material change of use commenced.ldquoIt is acknowledged that the appellant has sought to address concerns surrounding the anti-social behaviour and the consequent effects this is having on the amenity of the residential area resulting from the use of the dwellinghouse, it is the view of the council that these matter are not a relevant consideration in respect of this appeal given that the appellant has accepted use of the dwellinghouse for short terms commercial visitor accommodation is a breach of planning control.Mr Kirk concludes his statement by saying that ldquoit is the position of the council that in order to remedy the breach of planning control in respect of an authorised use the only available route is to cease the unauthorised use and revert the back to the established use, meaning thatthe council is successful in its enforcement Mr Cameron will have to cease using the property for short-term lets.Having received both sides of the argument, the Scottish Governmentrsquosplanning officers will now conduct a site visit at Linton Lodge and make a judgement on the case, which is expected by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"community-rallies-to-support-the-family-of-amanda-cox","story":"A HUGE community effort to support the family of Amanda Cox will continue this evening.The

Irsquom all for what is being proposed but in the interest of fairness we need to go back to the public on this.However, some councillors have spoked out in opposition to introducing any anti-alcohol by-laws at all.In particular, Jedburgh and District councillor Scott Hamilton said the by-laws would contravene personal liberties, and tabled a motion calling for the proposals to be scrapped altogether.He told fellow councillors: ldquoBy agreeing to move these by-laws forward, we will be starting a process which barbarously pushes back our freedoms and personal liberties.ldquoIt is the freedom of choice which has underpinned the very ethos of le in the western world, and we this morning seek to change a liberty. Granted, it is a small liberty, but it must be treated with utmost care and consideration.ldquoWe need to have a real and considered debate before deciding on this.

It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

education establishments.Until now the schools in the town had P-Ps attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P.However, both schools operated their own curriculums independent of each other.A recent inspection by Education Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its

of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-700-celebrations-build-on-great-work","story":"Councillor John McMillan praised the efforts of the Haddington  team.Events have been held throughout the year to mark  years since the town received the Bruce Charter ndash the oldest document in the East Lothian Archives.The final event saw a concert held by Siobhan Miller at St Maryrsquos Parish Church last Thursday evening.Mr McMillan said: ldquoFor the children, in the Year of Young People, we finished on the John Knox and Robert the Bruce Lego event.ldquoIt was amazing and a great tribute to Ruth Fyfe and Frances Woodrow, the archivists at the John Gray Centre, who had the initial idea and have been at the heart of it all.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-ministers-book-of-poetry-inspired-by-the-bible","story":"The Rev Jock Stein, along with we Margaret, was joint locum minister at Cockenzie Old Parish Church before stepping down in .Originally he started writing one poem for each of the  books in the Bible and then, encouraged by friends, expanded his poetic project further.He said: ldquoThey said to me it was daft just to approach it that way as it would be too complicated and folk might not understand it, so it was suggested I focus on people and their stories, which is why From Cosmos to Canaan is the first of many volumes.ldquoIn it I examine key issues and use poetry to give a new slant on it.

Looks like a shoo-in for an Oscar or two.Alison RowatNOWIT was a programme that set st century standards for the commissioning of new artwork and everyone in the UK came within the reach of the - NOW commemoration of the centenary of the First World War.Among the final year highlights were Anna Meredith and  Productionsrsquo Five Telegrams, opening both the BBC Proms and Edinburgh International Festival, and :Dusk, the final part of the music-theatre trilogy by Oliver Emmanuel and Gareth Williams in Perth.The culmination, though, was Danny Boylersquos Pages of the Sea, remembering inidual sacrices in a participative project of sand sculpture and communal reading of a specially-commissioned poem from Carol Ann Duffy on the centennial Remembrance Day itself.Of the half dozen possible locations in Scotland, I was at Ayr South Beach and was moved beyond words. In a year when  memories of the th centuryrsquos global conflicts were invoked by insular racist bigots, Pages of the Sea spoke truth unto power.Keith BruceCinemaShopltersCHOICES, choices.

Her penultimate scene in the movie is a tour de force. And a reminder that sometimes cinema is really all about faces.Teddy JamiesonMusicDavid Byrnes American Utopia TourJUST when I thought Irsquod seen everything the gig has to offer, a Dumbarton-born -year-old blew my mind in  by re-inventing live music. David Byrne isnrsquot your average OAP, of course, and the former Talking Heads frontman has spent a letime exploring the boundaries of pop, rock, film, visual art and conceptualism.His American Utopia tour, which honoured Glasgow twice with its presence this year, brought them all together in the most audacious and breathtaking way you could imagine, as Byrne and an -strong troupe of choreographed musicians ndash barefoot in grey suits ndash danced their way through his back catalogue. Dazzling, le-affirming and utterly euphoric.Marianne TaylorVisual ArtFor To the Power of Twelve, Christine BorlandTURNER Prize nominated artist, Christine Borland, takes a forensically intelligent approach to creating art. For To the Power of Twelve at Mount Stuart on Bute, which ran this summer into autumn, Borland made  new artworks as a response to the buildings history as a naval hospital during World War One.Moss Pillow, displayed in a light-drenched conservatory on an upper floor which once served as an operating theatre, still lives in my mind. Hanging like a giant tropical flower, and cut from the hem of a pink parachute, the \"flower\" contained sphagnum moss, used during WW dress wounds. Beautul and thought-provoking.Jan PatienceTheatrePride and Prejudice,The Tron Theatre, GlasgowWHO would have thought a stage production of Jane Austen in which  novel characters are reduced to just five, each wearing Doc Martenrsquos and a dress, would be the theatre hit of the year As well as perform the role of Darcy brilliantly, writer Isobel McArthur re-told this story in such an imaginative manner you could almost hear Austen slapping her hands in wild approval.She also refused to mock the sensibilities of the era, instead recognising not only the pragmatism of survival, but the enduring power of love.Brian BeacomDanceXENOS, Akram Khan CompanyINXENOS, dancer choreographer Akram Khan devoted his last ever, full- solo to Britainrsquos largely forgotten Indian recruits who fought and died in the First World War. East and West, past and present, shades of Colonialism and Khanrsquos own background, overlapped pungently throughout.Mary BrennanTheatrePussy Riot: Riot Days,Summerhall, EdinburghMARIA Alyokhinarsquos Herald Angel-winning multi-media stage version of her memoir of prison le was a dramatic call to arms like no other. Charting the aftermath of Alyokhinarsquos arrest in  alongside two of her comrades in anti-authoritarian Russian collective Pussy Riot following their lsquopunk prayerrsquo in a Moscow orthodox church, Yury Muravitskyrsquos production was a fty-minute multi-media collage of text, electronica, martial drumming and archive projections.Performed in Russian with English surtitles by Alyokhina and a quartet of actor musicians, Riot Days necessitated Alyokhina to smuggle herself out of Russia for the showrsquos ten-night Edinburgh Festival Fringe run at Summerhall. The result was relentless, defiant and inspirational.Neil CooperCinemaOutlaw KingWITH all the hype beforehand, Outlaw King could have fallen flat on its face. Any detractors were sorely disappointed, however, when the big-budget Robert the Bruce biopic achieved what Braveheart did not: it masterfully swerved the quagmire of Scottish cringe.Directed by David Mackenzie and starring Chris Pine as the eponymous hero, the poundmillion movie ndash made for Netflix and the largest feature film to be shot here to date ndash is spellbinding viewing.The big star is Scotland itself, with a raft of familiar landscapes and landmarks including Skye, Glencoe, Linlithgow Palace, Craigmillar Castle and Glasgow Cathedral to name but a few. The Battle of Loudoun Hill ndash shot at Mugdock Country Park near Milngavie ndash will give you goosebumps.Susan SwarbrickMusicLight on the ShoreFROM many highlights ndash including Lokirsquos Fringe show, Helen McCloryrsquos Mayhem and Death, the Offa Rex album included ndash I will pick the Light on the Shore gig at the Edinburgh International Festival. The Leith Theatre, which over recent years has been brought back to le by both its own Trust and the Hidden Door festival, was resplendent in itself, giving a glimpse of how this beautul hall could once again be a signicant arts venue in the north of Edinburgh.And the gigs themselves were great: a classical take on Boards of Canadarsquos Hi Scores, Mogwai in ferocious form, a beautul set from Kathryn Joseph, and a startlingly fine concert from Anna Meredith. Of what I saw, it was all good. And it seemed like the EIF was transforming into something  before our eyes. And hopefully, showed that the Leith Theatre is absolutely worth saving, for the long term.Phil MillerMusicDamo SuzukiTHERE was no mistaking the sense of pilgrimage we felt as made our way through the pouring Glasgow rain to a date with a legend of our private musical world.Damo Suzuki is the Japanese vocalist whose hypnotic incantations graced the run of early lsquos albums which burnished the reputation of German rock pioneers CAN ndashTago Mago, Ege Bamyasi and Future Days. That three of the bandrsquos founding and most influential members ndash Michael Karoli, Jaki Liebezeit and Holger Czukay ndash are no longer with us added to the pathos surrounding this solo appearance of Suzuki, now , at Mono.But, in the spirt of CAN, this was never going to be a greatest hits show. Instead, what the quietly inspirational Suzuki served up was a loose, shape-shting, improvised journey into sound, his shamanic chanting coaxing his willing band down gloriously unpredictable musical avenues. It lasted no more than  minutes, and featured only two extended segments of music, but every second was tantalising. One suspects Damorsquos old CAN comrades would have approved.Scott WrightJazzFergus McCreadie Trio, Jazz at St James, LeithTHESaturday before he appeared in the BBC Young Jazz Musician  final in November pianist Fergus McCreadie gave an incredible demonstration of his skills.Playing a digital keyboard in the absence of a ldquosteam piano and with a last-minute deputy, the superb Greg Irons, on drums, McCreadie played with gorgeous lyricism and phenomenal power, making an instrument that rarely flatters its exponents dance with his blend of Scottish-accented phrasing and jazz invention.He didnrsquot win the BBC competition but he earned two standing ovations for the sheer artistry and emotion of this performance.Rob Adams"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Here   s what we missed while we were all bickering about Brexit","story":"Everything  has been on hold.Had it not been for Brexit there would, I think, have been much more about the state of the NHS. I keep hearing of people having to go private because they canrsquot get elective surgery ndash thatrsquos hips and knees ndash without waiting in agony for a year. Therersquos been a crisis of recruitment, with GPs retiring early and medical staff ing to Europe because of Brexit. Health boards are going bust and Audit Scotland pronounced the Scottish NHS ldquofinancially unsustainable in October.The merger of social care and healthcare has not generated the economies of scale and integration many hoped for. Scotland will share in the extra pound billion for the NHS announced in the UK Budget ndash but that doesnrsquot really amount to much in a service that still uses fax machines and pagers.The Trussell Trust says that use of foodbanks has risen by more than % thanks largely to the new benefit system. Yet the Government has placed badly-needed reforms on hold as part of its no-deal Brexit planning. The Scottish Government has just taken on greater responsibility for welfare and is under intense pressure from charities to mitigate the impact of Universal Credit.Obsessed with Brexit, we all but forgot that there is a war going on in Europe: in the Donbass region of Ukraine. The Ukraine government recently imposed martial law prior to an expected crackdown on pro-Russian separatists.Meanwhile, Putin has placed hundreds of battle tanks on the border. Nato is reportedly supplying arms to the pro-Western Poroshenko government in Kiev, so any Russian invasion could ignite the most serious conflict in Europe since the Second World War.Then, out of the blue, Donald Trump pulls US troops out of Syria and we suddenly remember that wersquove given hardly a thought all year to whatrsquos been happening in the Middle East and the war against Isis. It is now recognised that allied bombing of Raqqa was just as deadly to civilians as the widely-condemned Russian bombing of Aleppo. Amnesty International says the British and US strikes may have amounted to war crimes.Donald Trump continued his trade wars in . Were it not for the Brexit blinkers wersquod probably be preparing to deal with the next economic recession, which many economists seem convinced is coming. There is now a deadly combination of Trump wars, overcapacity, and public and private debt weighing down the global economy. You may not have noticed but one of the biggest stock-market booms in history has just come to a crashing end.The focus is on the beef between China and America, but the situation in the European Union is not reassuring. There was a potentially disastrous standoff between the Italian populist government of deputy Matteo Salvini and the EU this month, which echoed the Greek crisis of . A sovereign debt crisis looms as Italian debt rises beyond % of GDP. Central banks have little in their armoury left to deal with another recession, after a full decade of zero interest rates and quantitative easing.The internet has destroyed most of the high street, the newspaper industry, terrestrial broadcasting and is now eating itself, with Google and Facebook mired in scandals over surveillance capitalism. The tech giants finally lost their progressive gloss in .Demands for greater regulation grew ever louder following revelations about Cambridge Analyticarsquos targeted advertising during the Brexit referendum. Much of this algorithmic activity was allegedly financed by ldquodark money from right-wing plutocrats. rsquos intrepid tech reporter, Carole Cadwalladr, claimed collusion between Brexiters and the Kremlin trying to destabilise our politics.However, it emerged this month that British intelligence spooks have been conducting their own psyops programme through a company registered in, of all places, Auchtermuchty. The Integrity Initiative has reportedly been enlisting journalists to help conduct a retaliatory social media campaign against the Kremlin. This seems to have mainly involved smearing Jeremy Corbyn and his communications director, Seumus Milne, as Kremlin shills. I can confirm that the Integrity Initiative hasnt approached me ndash yet.Meanwhile, China is becoming a huge player in the ldquocognitive-military complex as the new hybrid warfare is being called. The Communist state stands accused of all manner of digital jiggery-pokery, online warfare and industrial espionage. The FBI warned this month that the cybersecurity threat from China ndash spying, hacking and so forth ndash is worse than anything Putinrsquos Fancy Bears have been up to. The Chinese tech giant Huawei has been banned from selling its G mobile phone equipment to America, Canada and New Zealand because it is feared there could be security issues.A Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested by the Canadian government this month, provoking number of retaliatory detentions of Canadians by the Chinese.Huawei is now the biggest telecoms equipment company in the world and works hand-in-glove with the Communist regime, including on its seriously scary social engineering programmes: Social Credit. This assigns a digital trust score to every one of Chinarsquos . billion citizens, based on their behaviour under constant video surveillance. It is an algorithmic dictatorship, a true digital dystopia, straight out of Black Mirror.Therersquos no sign of the government wishing to emulate this here, though there have been some worrying developments, such as the proposals to make misogyny and other forms of behaviour illegal under hate crime laws.The police are now recording as ldquohate incidents jokes, abusive remarks and accusations of transphobia. It may not be long before our digital devices like Alexa are checking on whether or not we use hate speech in our homes ndash theyrsquore already said to be eavesdropping on us for commercial purposesAnd Scotland  Well, perhaps the greatest casualty of Brexit has been Scottish politics, which practically ground to a halt in . The Scottish Parliamentrsquos powers have been undermined by two Supreme Court rulings relating to Brexit.The Sewel Convention is no more, and the Scottish Government has been put firmly in its place over its Continuity Bill, which tried to oppose the ldquopower grab of responsibilities repatriated from Brussels. Westminster remains sovereign over all matters, and possesses ldquounqualied legislative power, as the Law Lords ruled.No-one is even talking of a Scottish independence referendum any more, since it would simply be rejected by the UK Government.

In his introduction to the Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War, Professor Hew Strachan writes that the war \"did not end as neatly as the commemorative events clustered around the anniversary of the armistice. Conflict persisted across central and eastern Europe civil wars ided Russia and Poland ...\" Revolutionary unrest had also been stirred in some parts of Germany.On Christmas Day, the Glasgow Herald wrote with feeling that it was ldquothe happiest Christmas Western Europe has known since the lurid cloudburst of August . Even so, it was hard to think of the festive season in ldquofull Christmas terms, so to speak, the leading article added, ldquofor the European Continent is shaking with revolutionary fires, machine-guns are still making targets of targets of human bodies [machine-guns and tear-gas had been deployed in central Berlin on Christmas Eve], and the gaunt spectre of famine is claiming myriad of victims in desolated countries.But, that December, no-one could blame people for celebrating a Christmas and New Year in peace. In Scotland, the Herald observed, Christmas Day, a Wednesday, was celebrated ldquowith a measure of festivity approaching pre-war times.In London, the king and queen, who attended a morning service at Westminster Abbey, issued a message that was relayed to hospitals where the disabled, sick and wounded from the war were being treated.ldquoAnother Christmas has come round, it began, ldquoand we are no longer fighting. God has blessed your effortshellip To the disabled, sick and wounded, we send a special greeting, praying that with ing health you may be comforted and cheered by the vision of those good days of peace for which you have sacriced so much. Glasgow Royal Infirmaryrsquos chairman, James Macfarlane, replied that the message had been read to the infirmaryrsquos sick and wounded sailors and soldiers, ldquoall of whom, I am glad to say, are doing well.In Glasgow, private business offices, government offices and most shops were closed. In the evening, great numbers of people strolled along the main streets, though the ldquogreat mass of the population ndash those who worked in the shipyards and other industries - would have to wait until the Saturday for their holiday season to begin.Several organisations went to considerable s to entertain ious groups, from some , children of soldiers who had died during the war, to Belgian refugees who were living in the city, and wounded soldiers recovering in hospital.Special performances were put on in Glasgowrsquos theatres, music-halls and cinemas, all enjoyed by what the Herald termed as ldquoholidaymakers. Among the attractions: a panto, Handy Andy, at the Princessrsquos theatre Jack and the Beanstalk at the Alhambra a lsquoGrand Amateur Carnivalrsquo at the ColiseumLittle Red Riding Hood at the Theatre Royal ragtime duettists Manny and Roberts, from Broadway, at the Empire a new musical play, Going Up, Going Up, at the Kingrsquos.There was, as it turns out, a more unusual attraction on offer. A number of surrendered German submarines were on display at both the Broomielaw and Kingston dock. So great was the press of people eager to inspect them that many had to be turned away.In Edinburgh, churches staged well-attended Christmas services at the Scottish General Military Hospital, Craigleith, where there were  patients, including  repatriated prisoners of war, the wards were gaily decorated, and each patient received a parcel containing tobacco, chocolate and other items.In Greenock, workers at the torpedo factory enjoyed a day off. In Alloa, gts were distributed to  adults and children, including  war widows. Each received a package of two cakes, bread, tea and cake the older men also received pouches of tobacco, while blankets, coal and groceries were also given to those who really needed them. In Kirkcaldy, Bonnybridge, Cambuslang and Kilmarnock, women and children who had lost husbands and fathers to the war were entertained and given provisions.The weather was not particularly pleasant in Aberdeen, but people celebrated anyway. The bells rang at the cityrsquos St Nicholas church on Christmas Eve for the first time since .Come Hogmanay, the festive celebrations had reassumed their traditional shape. In Glasgow, for the first time since the outbreak of war, the bells pealed at the cityrsquos Cross Steeple to mark the advent of a new year. During the day,  couples received permission from the Sherf in Glasgow to register their marriages. Many of the new bridegrooms in the last fortnight were soldiers or army pensioners.ldquoThere was to be seen in the bearing of the crowds which thronged the streets, remarked the Herald, ldquoan abandonment to the holiday spirit that was absent on similar occasions since the war began.lsquoThroughout the day the main thoroughfares were busy with family parties and vistors generally, and as evening drew on and the shop windows were lighted up with a brilliance to which the citizens have long been unaccustomed, the streets presented a very lively appearance.ldquoThere was stir, too, at the railway stations, with the departure of citizens to bring in the New Year among friends in the provinces, and with country people coming to spend a holiday in the city. Large numbers of soldiers and sailors on leave also arrived. Extra trams and trains had to be laid on to cope with the demand.ldquoNot only the railways but the shopkeepers and amusement caterers felt the holiday pressure, the Herald added. ldquoExtra performances were given at most of the theatres and music halls and at the Circus, while the picture-houses had continuous shows from eleven orsquoclock in the forenoon.A large crowd assembled at Glasgow Cross to see in the first new year of peace. Many soldiers from Scottish battalions joined in alongside colleagues from Canadian, Australian and South African forces.The Herald reported: ldquoThe best of good humour characterised the conduct of the assemblage, and the time of waiting was spent in chaff and banter, with here and there the lilt of a Scots song or a pantomime ditty.ldquoWhen the hour struck a great cheer was raised. Simultaneously the bells rang out a merry New Year carillon, the first since pre-war days.The cityrsquos bell-ringer played a number of tunes, Auld Lang Syne among them, of course.

They plan to do this by offsetting all the harmful emissions which are released into the atmosphere.But given an estimated .m people are expected to travel to the World Cup , can Qatar really pull off this promise And for all the appeal of major sporting events, is FIFA selling us short when it claims to promote environmental conservation FIFA insists on each event being assessed for the effectiveness of its greening activities before, during and afterwards, so on the surface, there should be no place to hide.For example, the Brazilian governmentrsquos initiative, Agenda for a Sustainable World Cup, saw sustainability as the neutralisation of carbon through the purchase of certicates issued by those who created the emissions.So the environmental damage associated with the construction of the Arena Pantanal Cuiaba was offset by a reforestation project on the banks of the River Pantanal.However, the gloomy lessons of history tell us that standards often slip.Qatar is widely credited with pulling off a minor miracle for its energy-saving cooling technology in stadiums, defeating criticism that players and spectators could not tolerate the nationrsquos extreme temperatures.More than  jet nozzles will blast out cold air, keeping temperatures at around  degrees Celsiusfor everyone inside.Chilled water is piped to the stadium from a cooling centre a mile away and once it arrives cold air is pushed out into the arena.Qatar claims this uses % less energy than other cooling methods. Other innovations include the showcasing of pavements that generate electricity and seating made out of recycled palm branches.The eight stadiums are within just a -mile radius of the capital, Doha, cutting down on travel time during the -day event.And at the end of the tournament, they have pledged to rebuild them in the developing world.The tiny Gulf nation is growing .million sq.metres of grass every year ndash enough to cover  football pitches ndash to make the areas around stadiums more fan-friendly.Along with  treesand thousands of shrubs, these are all being cultivated at a nursery farm irrigated by Doha North Sewage Treatment Works, which keeps two , sq m lagoons topped up.Qatarrsquos World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, proudly trumpets its green credentials on its website.This includes a list of Sustainability Facts about Qatar  stadiums which include water conservation, energy-efficient LED lights and the demountable stadiums made out of shipping containers which will be donated to developing countries along with , seats.The question remains, however, whether theyrsquore able to pull it off. Certainly, there are sceptics who point to FIFArsquos carbon-offsetting scheme in Russia. A recent study suggested that only % of its emissions reductions were likely to deliver real results.If Infantino gets his wish to increase the  World Cup from  to  teams, then he also risks increasing the tournamentrsquos carbon footprint, as extra matches held in other countries will necessitate more air travel by players and fans.It is not enough to pay lip service to sustainability and conservation. The World Cup remains the most lucrative and costliest football event in the world, with FIFA raking in billions of dollars in revenue every four years.Construction and preparation for the  World Cup cost pound.bn for Russia, with most coming from public funding. Brazil spent to build pound.bn stadiums and transportation.For FIFA to truly deliver on the promises of its Green Goal project, it is crucial that tournaments factor sustainability into the planning, design and construction of tournaments from the outset, and involve both the private and public sector.We must all demand total transparency when it comes to measuring the impact of each tournament.With all its money and laudable goals, there are high hopes for Qatar.

Before bringing its Budget back to Parliament, the SNP must think again.One of the social security levers provided to Holyrood after the independence referendum was the ability to \"top up\" reserved benefits.Ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackayrsquos draft Budget in December, a coalition of academics, charities and anti-poverty groups called on the minority SNP administration to boost child benefit by pound.In a separate letter to Mackay, senior church figures also demanded the Government act with ldquogreater urgency by backing the same policy.The benefit, which is taxable for some high-earning families, is currently worth pound. a week for the eldest child and pound. for additional children. A pound-a-week rise for each child has been costed at around pound million.However, Mackay snubbed the calls and the Government is sticking with its plan of introducing an ldquoincome supplement by , which could be after the next Holyrood election.New figures, produced by Scottish Labour, show that over half-a-million families would receive a boostthe policy was introduced next year.The statistics also reveal that , families with more than one child would see their income topped up by at least pound a year.Around , families with two children would receive the pound-plus rise, as would , family units with three children, and over , families with four or more kids.In Glasgow, nearly , families fit into this category, while the figure for central Scotland is closer to ,.Critics of the proposal believe topping up the benefit, first introduced in , is an inefficient way of lting some of the , children out of poverty.At First Ministerrsquos Questions earlier this year Nicola Sturgeon said the policy would result in a ldquodrop in child poverty of ldquojust two percentage points, adding: ldquoI am not saying that that is insignicant, but we are committed to introducing an income supplement, and in doing so we must ensure that the money that is invested in it has maximum effectiveness in tackling child poverty.She also said that pound out of every pound would go to families who are not living in poverty.Children are deemed to be living in povertythey are in households with less than  per cent of median household income.Leonard told this newspaper: ldquoOur communities are being held back by austerity. The fact that one-in-four children in Scotland are spending Christmas living in poverty is nothing short of a national outrage. Children in poverty cannot wait for help, they need it now. Before bringing its budget back to Parliament the SNP must think again.ldquoLabourrsquos plan to top-up Child Benefit by pound per week will mean more than quarter of a million families across Scotland will be pound better off.\"John Dickie, chair of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: \"There is no question that families need an immediate boost to their incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing. The Scottish Governments commitment to an income supplement by  is hugely welcome, but families who are struggling to put food on the table and pay the bills now really canrsquot wait that long.ldquoA pound top up to Child Benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage that poverty wreaks.\"Rt Rev Susan Brown, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: ldquoIt is a political, social and moral imperative that we act now to effect change for the good.ldquoThe Church of Scotland stands alongside people of all faith traditions, and none, in the move towards fairness for all our children.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate child poverty.ldquoWe are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most, as research shows topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.ldquoOur Tackling Child Poverty Delivery Plan outlines action to reduce child poverty, including investing poundm in intensive employment support for parents, introducing our new Financial Health Check service and increasing school clothing grants.

As it comes to a close, we ask young activists, school students and youth campaigners what their hopes and fears are for the year ahead.If they could wave a magic wand, what would they make change  And what about the world around them worries them most Holly Gillibrand, \"Climate change is what concerns me most about the world. My family have been worried about climate change, but itrsquos only started dawning on me in the last few years that itrsquos really serious and that we need to do something about it.We stopped eating meat because thatrsquos bad for the environment and we try to limit the amount of times we go in the car. We use green energy and wersquore going to start growing our own vegetables.A couple of weeks ago I went into Fort William town centre, and I talked to local cafes about using plastic straws because to make plastic you use fossil fuels. We recently had a meeting because wersquore trying to create a Fort William Extinction Rebellion group so we can do some action in .I think, politically, there just needs to be much more action, because politicians and leaders are having all these climate talks but nothing is actually happening. We could tax CO, we could tax meat to encourage more sustainable and ethical eating, but that isnrsquot happening. The politicians and the government need to be doing much more.Irsquove been reading about it and the UK government is planning to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions by  per cent by , which is not enough. There need to be zero greenhouse gas emissions by  worldwide.There are still people in my class who donrsquot think that climate change exists. I think that one thing that needs to happen in  is for schools to start educating young people on climate change. There needs to be more awareness. In one of my classes at high school we had some lessons on the global goals and it was depressing that climate action is number  when it should be number one.Irsquove seen quite a few of the talks by Greta Thunberg [the teenage activist who has inspired a generation with her climate strikes] and, in fact, after the holidays Irsquom going to start climate striking ndash only for an hour every Friday. Irsquom just going to sit outside school for an hour in the morning. Irsquom trying to get other people involved but on February  therersquos going to be a UK-wide school strike.Parisa Shirazi, I work for an MP, and I come at this question from what Irsquove seen in casework. There are a lot of things which make you very angry.When yoursquore working in an MPrsquos office a lot of things that you deal with are to do with social security and immigration cases and what I see day in and day out is that perfectly ordinary, good people are being treated with a hell of a lot of scepticism. We see people whose benefits are being cut, people who are very ill being dragged in for disability assessments, people who are just applying for visiting visas for their familythey have a new baby in the UK and just facing blanket refusals.So what I would like to see I less cynicism towards certain groups of people. There is a lot of scepticism towards people in the benefits system. There seems to be a lack of appreciation of the fact that the system is paid into by everyone and itrsquos thereanyone needs it. Thatrsquos what the welfare state is for ndash itrsquos not to demonise a certain group of people.Irsquove not always been political. I grew up in Northern Ireland, apathetic towards politics. I moved away when I was , studied in Durham and did my masters in Edinburgh.I feel exhausted by Brexit. I feel like it was an enormous amount of upheaval for no gain. It just fills me with despair. Becauseyou study a law degree, as I did, you hear about things like disability rights and other rights that were brought about by being part of the EU.Sanna Aziz, \"I do a lot of campaigning around race equality. What I would like to see in  is a lot more research into the racial wage gap. There is not enough prominent research into what it is like for women of colour to be in the workplace and get paid so little compared to their white or male counterparts. I would also like to see some actual work being done in that area, in trying to make that equality, some sort of initiatives so therersquos a whole government drive towards that goal.Last year I went to the United States on an exchange set up in Jo Coxrsquos memory. It was inspiring. We visited so many dferent organisations. We went just after Trump was elected and they were talking about the amount of hate crime that was spiked then in the US. The organisations there felt like they were getting pushed back, but they were still pushing forward. They were saying no matter what happens just keep pushing forward because eventually you will make change.What drives me is that when I was a kid, I experienced a lot of racially based bullying. I used to get so upset about it, but when I was older and in high school before I left, I talked to the kid and I asked him why and he didnrsquot have a proper reason for why.From then I realised a lot of it is done out of ignorance, so from then on I tried to prevent people being as ignorant, and make them come to terms with the damage they can do when theyrsquore being racist or homophobic.Irsquom studying international politics at Stirling University. A large part of me is really nervous to go into the jobs market. But again, Irsquom hopeful. Irsquom just hopeful that everything will work out and my generation will be able to maybe not fix things, but improve them.I want to see more consideration for what iniduals experience on a day-to-day basis when theyrsquore of colour. Because some days itrsquos fine, but other days you can be walking down the street and you get spat at or given dirty looks or something. Those things are not severe enough for people to say itrsquos a hate crime. Itrsquos just a day to day stigma around people of colour that I want us to get rid of. I know it wonrsquot happen overnight. It probably wonrsquot happen in the next ten years but Irsquom hopeful.Hannah Brisbane, ldquoIn  I would like to see more girls having more confidence and speaking out on issues that matter to them and being invited into important discussions. With Girl Guiding Scotland next year wersquore developing a youth forum and my role with them is helping lead to that. Irsquom really excited to give our members a space to speak out on issues that effect girls and young women.Irsquove had lots of opportunities over the past four years. Irsquove given evidence at the Scottish Parliament in committees and met MPs and MSPs. So I definitely feel that Irsquove been listened to and Irsquom keen to help other girls have that same experience. Irsquove done a lot of work on sexual harassment and in particular harassment in schools.Research we did a few years ago found that two-thirds of girls had experienced some sort of harassment in school. Thatrsquos unacceptable and we had the opportunity to bring that evidence to the Scottish Parliament and do some work with them on how we can change things, for instance develop Personal and Social Education.We started that work before the Weinstein scandal came out. Movements like MeToo and TimesUp have forced people to take these issues more seriously.Brexit makes the year ahead really uncertain. I voted Remain and Irsquom definitely worried about losing certain rights. For instance I was on an Erasmus exchange year last year and after school I worked for a year to save up to go travelling around Europe. I do French and politics at Edinburgh University, so I feel that possibilities from that might be more limited. Irsquod hope that those rights that we had will remain but no one knows what will happenNicola Sturgeon is probably one of my political heroes. I remember looking up to her even when she was just Health Secretary and thinking that women can be a force to be reckoned with in politics.Joe Hesmondhalgh, \"My biggest concern is climate change and the current climate crisis. Itrsquos always been on my radar, but the UN report that came out in September really brought it to my attention. It said we had twelve years to stop the worst effects of the potential climate crisis and that terried me. What is also terrying to me is the lack of urgency from our government and powerful institutions and the media.I got involved in Extinction Rebellion, a climate action group that uses non-violent, disruptive methods to get our voices heard, in November. I helped set up the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow group but also the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow University group and Irsquove been involved in two direct actions so far. Irsquom willing to be arrested for this because itrsquos the most important thing there is.When I think of all of the issues I care about, climate change will make all of them worse. I really care about homelessness ndash it will make that worse. I really care about human rights ndash it will make that worse. I really am willing to get arrested for it. I think a lot of other people are too.Brexit is obviously an issue which is going to have a big impact on my le, but when therersquos such a massive, global crisis looming, it almost feels like itrsquos a distraction. Wersquove got twelve years to save the planet and the Brexit negotiations will probably take that long to wrap. When you see the massive resources that are being put into Brexit negotiations and preparations fortherersquos a No Deal, it just seems crazy. We could be putting all those resources into averting climate change.What Irsquod like to see, in , is the Extinction Rebellion key demands happen. A commitment to zero carbon emissions by  would be a step in the right direction from the UK government. As a rich country, our government and us, as the public, have to take the lead in trying to avert the climate breakdown. I think creating fair climate policy is also a democratic issue.This is the first time Irsquove ever got involved in any direct action ndash for two reasons. Firstly, the UN climate change report had an impact on me and, secondly, I think Extinction Rebellion feels genuinely dferent. It feels like wersquove been signing petitions and writing to MPs for years and this is fresh and new and it exciting. Wersquove tried all the non-disruptive methods. I think itrsquos time to try disruptive methods.For a while I wasnrsquot optimistic about the future. Hearing, over the years, all the evidence and reports about climate change does make you cynical and it makes you want to switch off, but I think, after joining Extinction Rebellion and other groups, Irsquove stopped feeling miserable or cynical. I felt the same about homelessness but then I started volunteering at Shelter. I think working together with other people really does make you feel better about it. I think the best way to not feel miserable about these things is to do something about it alongside other people.\"Callum Lynch, \" is the year that Scotland has the opportunity to fundamentally reshape what a childhood can be for people who are or have grown up in care. I went into care when I was  and while that meant I was saved from the neglect that I lived in, it also meant spending the rest of my childhood surrounded by legal processes and professionalism.I had staff, not parents. I lived in a unit, not a home. I was physically restrained by the people who looked after me when it was deemed I wasnrsquot being compliant. I was part of routine conversations about whether it was a good idea for me to live in the same place as my brother, even though he was the only person who understood my le.I hear versions of this still,  years on, compounded by the fact that young people still donrsquot have the right to independent advocacy in legal meetings where enormous decisions are made about their le. Hope has, for many, felt like something hard to find in . I have felt like a bit of an anomaly this year because I have relished political conversations.Having spent the year campaigning and speaking to politicians from every party, I know that while there are fundamental disagreements about our constitutional make-up, there is political will to do something dferent for care experienced people. I believe that our politicians want something revolutionary to happen for those are or have been looked after by the state. \"Erin McAuley, ldquoA lot of our lives are very precarious. Although therersquos a lot more opportunity therersquos little security or stability. A lot of the jobs that young people are facing are insecure or are short-term contracts or are not well paid in comparison to the standard of living.It seems to be that therersquos a whole chunk of young people in Britain who are stuck in this precarious cycle of high rents and insecure work, low pay. That includes students. Irsquove qualied as a teacher recently, but to sustain myself at uni Irsquove worked all my four years. Irsquom in retail now, on a short-term contract.Itrsquos not unusual for young people to be in and out of short-term contracts. And something that frustrates me in work is that Irsquom doing exactly the same work as maybe my colleague younger than me or my colleague older than me, but wersquore all getting a dferent pay based on our age. Thatrsquos something that shouldnrsquot be happening.Irsquom chair of the Unite Youth Committee. Within that committee our three big things are the pay disparity among young people, mental health and rent. If I could wave a wand in , I would have something done about the price of housing, whether thatrsquos through rent caps or more social housing. But also I would change the world of work, and not have any zero-hour contracts and have wages that people feel they can sustain themselves on.Mental health is another thing that I would want to solve. There is a mental ill health epidemic and no wonder, given wersquove got an insecure job market, and insecure housing, plus so much more pressure on young people, with Instagram and twitter, to feel validated.Irsquove always campaigned for mental health services, partly because of my own experiences. I went to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicewhen I was  but then I got moved straight to the adult service because there was not a young adult service, and it was just a long waiting list. My magic wand for Scotland for mental health would be to bring in a - service.Bryn Evans, ldquoThe thing I most worry about to do with the world right now is Brexit. When the referendum happened, I was hopeful that the vote would go towards Remain so when it got announced that we were going to leave, it shocked me.A few of my friends are from a iety of dferent European countries and they are not scared but worried for their future in this country. I think some are just going to leave Scotland and not come back.The two things I would most hope to happen in  are Brexit not happening or Trump being put out of power."},{"url":null,"title":"a-royal-year-in-review-a-look-back-at-the-last-12-months-for-the-windsors","story":"Herersquos a look at how the year panned out for the Windsors.ndash JANUARYPrincess Charlotte started nursery at Willcocks Nursery School, close to her Kensington Palace home.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released sweet photographs of fourth in line to the throne Charlotte, ready for her first day.William and Kate, who were expecting their third child, carried out a brief official visit to Sweden and Norway amid freezing temperatures and played an unusual form of hockey called bandy in Stockholm.Princess Eugeniersquos engagement to Jack Brooksbank was announced and Zara and Mike Tindall said they were expecting their second child.Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle continued their tour of the UK ahead of their wedding, visiting youth-orientated radio station Reprezent FM in Brixton, south London, and Cardf Castle and a community centre on an away day to south Wales.ndash FEBRUARYMeghan took part in her first joint engagement with William, Kate and Harry when she took to the stage with them at a Royal Foundation forum in February.The former actress showed her support for the #MeToo and Timersquos Up Campaigns during an on-stage QA ndash and the quartet were dubbed the ldquoFab Four.Things we learned from the Fab Fourrsquos first engagement together https:t.co fwwbqpciEk by @PARoyal #MeghanMarkle #RoyalFoundation pic WsegyUPKzrmdash PA Royal ReportersFebruary , The Queen was the star of London Fashion Week when she took a seat in the front row to watch a catwalk show.ndash MARCHHarry and Meghan carried out visits to Birmingham and Belfast.#MeghanMarkle hugs a schoolgirl at Millennium Point in #Birmingham pic MwtqgVsFcvmdash PA Royal ReportersMarch , Former Suits star Meghan also took part in her first official event with the Queen when she joined the monarch and senior royals at the Commonwealth Day Service in Westminster Abbey.Heavily pregnant Kate resisted the temptation of a St Patrickrsquos Day tipple during a traditional toast to her and her husband by the Irish Guards in west London, sipping sparkling water instead.The Queen waved goodbye to the Royal Navyrsquos largest operational warship HMS Ocean following a decommissioning ceremony in Plymouth.ndash APRILThe Duke of Edinburgh had a hip replacement operation in early April, spending a week and a half in hospital, before convalescing in Windsor Castle.Meanwhile, Charles went to Australia to open the Commonwealth Games, and also visited the South Pacic island of Vanuatu.His future Commonwealth role was secured at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetingin London, when, in an unprecedented move, the Queen publicly spoke of her wish that he would be the future head of the family of nations when he is king.World leaders backed the decision, and Harry, who was appointed as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador, Meghan and William took part in CHOGM events.Kate, who was due to give birth any day, stayed at home, and baby Prince Louis put in an appearance on April  ndash patriotic St Georgersquos Day.The lb oz baby, whose name was not announced until four days later, made his debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing with his parents.ndash MAYMay was the month Harry and Meghan pledged their love for one another in a star-studded royal wedding in the th-century St Georgersquos Chapel at Windsor Castle.Meghan wowed the crowds in her simple, stunning pure white wedding gown by Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy.An emotional Harry was captivated by his bride as they met at the altar, telling her: ldquoYou look amazing.

Scottish Government has launched a People, Not Profit campaign to support the Scottish Credit Unions that play a vital role in helping people stay out of unmanageable debt.The campaign seeks to support the growth of the sector by raising awareness of credit unions and the services they offer to a wider and more erse audience.Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, launched the campaign.A new survey has revealed one in five Scots have not heard of a credit union.Currently, around , people across the country are part of a credit union some seven per cent of the population.The survey revealed also that only two-fthsof people questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union, and that one in four peoplewrongly believe they make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign will highlight credit unions are not-for-profit organisations providing loans and savings, and most people would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live.A new website has been launched to help people find out which credit union they could be a member of.Ms Campbell said: \"In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high-cost lenders.\"A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.\"Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union and I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.\"Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, who is a credit union member, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining

stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Gateway signage, roundels, mph repeater signs and speed indication devices have been introduced in all four Ross-shire towns.Some local residents commenting on social media felt it would be hard to police the speed restriction effectively.Wick man Konrad Szewczyk said: ldquoSuch nannying should be relegated to nurseries and primary schools, not entire settlements.\"A Bridge Street shopkeeper, Kevin Milkins, thought there was \"little use having laws with no-one to enforce them\", referring to a lack of policing.While one local woman who did not wish to be named said: \"They can set whatever speed limits they want but the idiots and young racers will decide their own speed.\"A council spokesperson said thatthe scheme goes through the consultation process with no objections it could be in place by March.Sunday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118636.jpg","title":"New chief is told of local issues","story":"BUDGET cuts and decentralisation were the main topics raised by Caithness people when the new Highland Council chief executive, Donna Manson, visited Wick and Thurso.She met staff, councillors and members of the public as she listened to their concerns and issues.

More than , young people were at the heart of it, and planned a calendar of sporting, music and cultural events for all ages to enjoy.A world-first initiative, Year of Young People was a commitment made by the Scottish Government. Young people worked alongside decision makers to make sure they were involved in the creation of government policy. This year, they established a Youth Commission which examines mental health services. They will have a greater say in their education with the creation of a Scottish Learner Panel, and will hold those in power to account with the launch of the First Minister’s Question Time for children and young people.YoYP was delivered in partnership with local and national organisations including schools, youth work services, EventScotland , Young Scot, Scottish Youth Parliament, Children in Scotland and YouthLink Scotland.More than  young ambassadors volunteered their time to challenge the negative stereotypes of their peers. Their role is to represent their local area, promote activities and showcase the positive contributions young people make to their local community.Orkney’s Hope Laing was one of those who volunteered to be a young ambassador. She said: “Year of Young People has given Scotland an opportunity to build young people’s reputation, and provide more opportunities for them to influence and take action. “I am very proud that I have been one of the ambassadors for my area, and being involved in helping young people shine in my local community.“A few highlights are: Stromness Drama Club winning the National Youth Festival Estrella, on their amazing Young Enterprise Venture which won three awards at the Young Enterprise Finals and their Managing Director, who has been announced as Young Entrepreneur of the Year!“One group which I am part of, the West Mainland Youth Achievement Group, had success this year competing in the MoneyforLe scheme. We went to London to represent Scotland at a National level and won with our project called ‘Trash to Cash’.“During my time as ambassador, I have had the privilege to meet and work with so many people from all walks of le. Without this opportunity, I don’t think I would feel as confident as I do now when taking on new challenges.“I would like to think that stereotypes of young people in Orkney were not too bad, but this year has highlighted how much good can come from the community working together. I would like to see this continue long after YOYP  has finished.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People are so depressed. Folk come to the beach to get away from all those headlines about what the idiots in Westminster are up to, but it only takes one person to mention the B-word to ruin everyone rsquos bacon roll.His partner Verity, who handles publicity for the cafeacute, agrees: ldquoTo put Br**** into context, our beach is over  million years old. This does put the media hysteria into context a bit, doesnrsquot it  Itrsquos beyond stupid, whatrsquos happening down south, but the world will not stop turning, and itrsquos unlikely that any cafeacute customer is going to be in a position to influence whatever eventually happens.ldquoSo why talk about it and feel helpless and miserable  We think people need a sanctuary from it all over Christmas and New Year, and we are just the place.Posters about the cafeacutersquos lsquopolicyrsquo will be going up shortly and all lsquofinesrsquo will benefit Maggiersquos Centre Highland.The offer of respite continues daily during the school winter holidays from .am to pm, with the exception of Christmas Day.

And early, please. The trade secret is what is known in politics as the Christmas Box a folio of previously prepared stories from press teams under day-by-day embargo drip-fed to tide the papers over until proper news starts happening again.Without Christmas Boxes, the news agenda would just be a diet of the day’s emergencies, the aftermath of drunken violence and the Old Firm. A bit like BBC Scotland every weekend.This year it’s much, much easier. No-one, not the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the First Minister, the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Patriarch of Constantinople or Richard Dawkins has any idea what’s going to happen in British or European politics next week, never mind next year, so commentators can speculate away in the knowledge that reality will be crazier than any guess.My punt is the Prime Minister’s Draft Withdrawal Agreement for leaving the EU will win the day but onlyshe follows the advice to narrow down the options. There is no parliamentary majority for any of the possible pathways and despite talk of Norway or Canada Plus, it might as well be Norwegian Wood or Canada Dry for all the attention the EU is paying. The options come down to a second in-or-out referendum, the draft deal or a no-deal departure.As the government is committed to the meaningful vote by  January, the first move onfrom recess a week on Monday should be to force a vote over a second referendum. With Jeremy Corbyn committed to Brexit it’s a vote the government should win, which would leave the draft withdrawal and a no deal departure which the majority also oppose. Game, set and match, Mrs May.But having gambled with General Election odds in her favour and lost heavily, will Mrs May gamble again  With advice from the level-headed David Liddington, I’m not betting against it. VA envyEnterprising iniduals can make their own headlines, as Edinburgh Labour leader Cammy Day has done with his views on the Dundee VA and how Edinburgh should be following suit. What caught the eye, on Tayside certainly, was Cllr Day’s rejoinder that “ bloody Dundee can get a VA, then the capital city wants something even better”. Somewhat more diplomatically, bloody Dundee councillor Lynne Short responded calmly: “It is goodwe are inspiring other towns and cities.”Happily, now working on what could be Edinburgh’s answer to the VA is award-winning Scottish architect John McAslan whose catalogue of major international works includes London King’s Cross Station. Typically in his game there has been the odd political scuffle, most notably his shelved plans for Glasgow’s George Square.His practice has been working on the £m Granton collections centre for the National Galleries of Scotland and ever-helpful Cllr Day chipped in: “What we don’t want is a big storage container. We want a VA, we want something that’s quite iconic. If that’s not what’s coming forward then we are not interested.” “Quite iconic  How quite iconic would you like it, sir,” might not be Mr McAslan’s immediate reaction, but the point about a focal point for the new district is reasonable. I could hardly argue, given I made the same point in June after a sneak preview of the VA. “Siting anything like the VA in or around Edinburgh city centre would cause uproar, but put it on the seafront in Granton and it might have a similar effect as it’s having in Dundee,” I wrote. The problem with iconic, as the saga of the ten-times-over-budget £m Scottish Parliament building demonstrated, is cost. The Dundee VA is only about the same size as the Holyrood debating chamber alone and from £m ended up costing just over £m. Not quite iconicIconic is not a word often used to describe Meadowbank Stadium. Controversial or crumbling certainly, historic to an extent but symbolic not so much, not in architectural terms anyway.But the ious schemes to replace the Commonwealth Games complex have come to symbolise bitter cynicism about local decision-makingand a deep disenchantment with Edinburgh Council.For all its shortcomings, the stadium gave the district a sense of identity which the new sports centre will struggle to match.A new animated ‘fly-through’ of the replacement centre has just been released by the council, revealing a perfectly al regional sports centre, but to borrow from Cllr Day, it’s not quite iconic. Maybe the reality will be more impressive, but it doesn’t look like much for £m, certainly not the underwhelming -seat spectator area which is supposed to be a new home for Third Division high-flyers Edinburgh City.There is no sound business case for the council to build and maintain an international athletics stadium which would be needed about once every two years. If a millionaire track and field fan came forward then maybe it could be dferent, but the last time a supposed tycoon flashed his wallet around Meadowbank it didn’t end well. But the new images will do little to quell the feeling the area has been short-changed.Progress prediction nilNew Meadowbank is due to open in  and approximately  months later voters get a chance to pass judgment on their councillors at the  local elections.

On each side of the body were three large fins, shaped like paws, and jointed.”One needs only to read that to note the striking similarity with the Loch Ness Monster.: Edinburgh scientists identy new prehistoric sea monsterUnfortunately, by the time the experts arrived on the scene, what remained of the beast had decayed to the point that it was dficult to determinethis was the real deal.Bits of the carcass, which included vertebrae segments and strands of hair, were transported to Edinburgh - then one of the most important scientic centres in the Western World - where they were poked, prodded and pondered over by members of the Wernerian Society. Nobody could figure out the mystery, but so convinced were the great minds of the time that this was a newly-discovered species, the beast was given its own scientic name: “Halsydrus Pontoppidani”, after a Norwegian bishop who recorded sea monsters in the s. Even Nessie doesn’t boast her own proper moniker.However, the mystery was short-lived. : German U-boat abandoned due to ‘sea monster’Esteemed surgeon Sir Everard Home brought the beast’s skull and neck bones with him to London, bursting the bubble in the process. Upon closer inspection of the vertebrae, Sir Everard concluded it was the scant remains of a humble basking shark.Basking sharks are not uncommon in the North Sea, particularly during the summer months. They are seen in even greater numbers in the North Atlantic and will occasionally venture close to the west coast of Scotland.Home’s findings were given further credence in the s by Dr Geoff Swinney, an expert on lower vertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles, who asserted that it was  per cent certain that it was a basking shark.And, with that analysis, the Stronsay Beast was dead.A specimen of the ‘sea serpent’s’ vertebrae is kept by the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street in Edinburgh.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh. Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1307567.jpg--.jpg?1544691749000\n","title":"ballykeel youth centre now open after refurbishment","story":"Ballykeel Youth Centre re-opened last week after a major refurbishment.The youth centre, which has been serving the Ballykeel community for  years had many of its areas rejuvenated. The work includes a new social area and ICT room, plus innovative youth mental health rooms for the Flare Project.Work began to transform the centre in March, with some staff working out of the Waveney Youth Centre, and young people only being able to use a small section of the building.From June of this year the centre has been closed to facilitate the refurbishment, therefore young people and staff were really looking forward to getting back to the building.Many young people rely on the youth centre on a daily basis.Running clubs and activities five nights of the week, around  youths use the facilities. Monday and Friday nights are for nine to twelve year olds, while Tuesday and Thursdays are the senior nights for teenagers.On Wednesday the centre is available for all on their split night.Run by the Education Authority Youth Service, the centre is a valued part of the community and provides important le skill training for young people, as well as providing them with activities. It features a youth leadership project and has a youth committee.Amie Mott, centre based youth worker for the Education Authority told theeveryone was excited for the opening.She said: The refurbishment is really lovely, and was greatly needed.“The young people have been using this building for  years so the enhancement was definitely needed.“In fact, some of the young people who are currently using the centre have told us their parents actually used it years ago, so in a lot of cases we are actually working with the second generation of Ballykeel young people!”Amie concluded by stressing the imporance and relevance of the centre to the community.She said: This is an important facility in the heart of Ballykeel, and we hope the new facilities will encourage even more young people to use the building.

It is this trip that has him in the full glare of publicity once again due to the Spotlight investigation. Evidence of the Males trip produced by the BBC show, included an image from the resort’s internal records which suggested that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of the Males government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, who himself is a former government minister.On whether the trip should have been declared, an expert on Parliamentary rules, Mr Gavin Millar QC, said it should have.He told the Spotlight programme: “If, as Spotlights documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy,Mr Paisley should not have accepted it.“But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly.“There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. “The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Males government.”DecorumIan Paisley claimed however that he did seek advice over whether to declare his trip.He said he spoke to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his previous Sri Lanka holidays, which his failure to declare resulted in his recent suspension from the House of Commons for  sitting days.He told the Spotlight programme that after the conversation he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday.However, when pressed further, the MP claried that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed, but in fact had spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members interests. contacted the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Parliamentary Registrar for a comment, however both refused to comment on private discussions with an inidual MP. They instead directed the ’s attention to the rules on the registration of Members’ financial interests.These rules clearly state under the heading of ‘Selflessness’ that: “Holders of public office should take decisions solely in terms of the public interest. “They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends.”Under the heading of ‘Integrity’ it states: “Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside iniduals or organisations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.”DenialMr.. Paisley last week denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Males, but rather that the cost was covered partly by himself and partly by a friend, who he has not named.He also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Males.Deacutejagrave vuMr. Paisley has just recently finished his  day suspension, the longest given to an MP, for failing to declare complimentary family holidays to Sri Lanka.  He told the House of Commons in July that he felt: “A deep personal embarrassment” over failing to declare his Sri Lankan trips and made the “profoundest of apologies. A jubilant Ian Paisley told thein the immediate aftermath of the shortfall in the ‘petition of recall’ that ‘a smaller man than me would have crumbled’ under the pressure he had faced. And he told the BBC that after avoiding a by-election by  votes, it was the public’s way of saying: “We are keeping you big fella, we like you” and that it was “a miracle.”He was also adamant that there were no other potentially embarassing issues which could impinge his role. He said: “No. Nothing at all. I mean that was a genuine mistake on my part, I made a mistake and I apologised for it and I was punished for it.The matter will now be referred back to the Parliamentary Standards Commission, where the allegations will be further scrutinised.

Last winter’s figures for NI will be released on Wednesday.The comments from Age NI come three weeks after the Department of Healthannounced a ‘review of urgent and emergency care’ with a particular focus on the elderly in light of emergency departments experiencing “intensying pressures over recent years”. DoH acknowledged growing waiting times for hospital admissions and that “another dficult winter period” is anticipated.Age NI welcomed the review – but expressed concern about the timing. “It is good news but it seems late in the day to start this processwe want to see any benefits this winter,” a spokeswoman said. ldquoit seems late in the day ,,, this process should have started months agoAge NI“We all know that our healthcare system, particularly our hospitals, come under extreme pressure during these winter months and this process should have started months ago.” She noted the “added impact” a long wait in AE can have on the elderly and pressed for “safe and effective” alternatives that will be “just as beneficial or more so than an admission to hospital”.Rita Devlin, deputy director of the RCN in NI, said nurses are worried. “Our members are fearful that there will be a repeat of the problems experienced last year in emergency departments over the holiday period,” she said. “Staff would hope that trusts will have contingency plans in place to ensure that services will be maintained at normal levels.”Dr Grainne Doran, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners NI, said GPs have “serious concerns about the increase in workload that will come this winter”. She added: “With services already struggling, doctors have voiced their concern about being able to manage with the additional workload during the winter season. “A review of emergency and urgent care, and the implementation of necessary changes, cannot come quickly enough.” of Donaghys, Banbridge presents a cheque for the money raised at the recent Ladies Night held in aid of Ellens Journey.

While each trust will have a winter contingency plan, he said, staff face “additional workload and work-related stress” during the winter period which may see “the whole system begin to wobble”.Properly funded home care packages for discharged patients are needed, he said, along with “meaningful long-term workforce planning” to have enough doctors in place to meet the needs.Last winter saw Antrim Area Hospital call in St John Ambulance volunteers for basic ward cover on New Year’s Eve, while SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said  people waited at Craigavon Area Hospital over two nights for assessment on January  and .In the first week of January, staff reported that Belfast’s Royal Victoria Hospital was “at breaking point” and a ‘major incident’ was declared because of the excessive backlog of patients.Londonderry’s Altnagelvin Hospital had to implement an emergency plan for its emergency department, and on Boxing Day the Southern Health Trust said patients were having to wait for up to  hours to speak to an out-of-hours GP.From December  to January  last year, some  NI patients waited more than  hours for admission, transfer or discharge, the BBC reported.However, the Department of Health said that its newly launched review of emergency care is not intended to address problems this winter.A spokeswoman said: “The review of urgent and emergency care is a long-term project and should not be conflated with initiatives to counter winter pressures in hospitals this year.”The review will aim to establish a new regional care model for the Province, with particular focus on the elderly, she said. “A range of measures have been put in place by trusts for this winter in expectation of another challenging period for health services across these islands.”The department has funded these initiatives, recognising the need for immediate mitigations and longer term review, she added.Age NI advises that by taking some simple steps, older people can stay warm, well and safe in the winter months-. By setting your heating to the right temperature , you can keep your home warm and your bills as low as possible.. Food is a vital source of energy, which helps to keep your body warm. Keep basic food items in the cupboard or freezer, and try to have hot meals and drinks throughout the day.. Try to avoid going outside on extremely cold days. If you do need to, wrap up warm and remember that several thin layers will keep you warmer than one thick layer.. Keeping active generates heat and helps to keep you warm, so when you’re indoors, try not to sit still for more than an hour. Get up and walk around, make yourself a warm drink, and spread any chores throughout the day.. If you’re over , be sure to have a seasonal flu jab. Seasonal flu viruses are always changing, so you need to have a jab every year, using the latest vaccine.. It’s not unusual to feel a bit down in winter. Try to keep to your usual routines and,you can’t visit friends, make sure you phone them regularly for a chat.. Call Age NI’s Advice Service on    for a free benefits check.

Take some time to yourself, some time to reflect, some time to remember and some time to recharge the batteries for the New Year ahead.“Andpossible take some time for others, I have really enjoyed meeting people during my term of office and sometimes a kind word or deed, or just a chat can lt someone’s day. So this Christmas time, maybe call on people who may be lonely or those in need of comfort.“I also know that for many families, like myself and my husband, Christmas can be a dficult time. “It stirs up lots of memories of good times and bad, of love, and of loss. For those people and families, I have no words of good advice, as I’m still just getting through, but I will say, be kind to yourself, be kind to others, and do what is right for you. “I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and a Peaceful and Prosperous New Year!”* Bins scheduled to be collected on on Boxing Day, Wednesday, December , will be collected on Saturday, December .

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern

In a move that’s sure to be viewed with envy by congregations all over the city, Clonard has upholstered its wooden seats just in time for the festive season. On Friday night the church welcomed guests to its sold-out Candlelight Christmas at Clonard event, which featured the St Dominic’s Grammar School for Girls’ Choir, baritone Karl McGuckin and West End star Niamh Perry. Clonard church manager Tom Brady said even at this early stage it’s clear the cushioned seats are a welcome addition at the church. “This is a way of providing comfort for the congregation, it’s a way of giving back to them and as a way of thanking them for all their support and generosity shown to the church,” he said. “Both our concert and carol service over the weekend were packed to capacity and with our annual Féile concerts people can rest assured that the seats will be cushioned for years to come. Clonard attracts people from all over and we are really looking forward to welcoming everyone who comes for their Christmas Masses. We have three vigils on Christmas Eve, one at pm, pm and .pm. “We would also like to thank all those who donated so generously to our Christmas crib during the carol service and hampers are now being prepared and distributed by the St Vincent de Paul Society.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local schoolboy pulls toddler from pond","story":"A YOUNG boy from the Cltonville area has been hailed a “hero” after pulling a toddler from the Waterworks lower pond.-year-old Neil Francis Montgomery from Brookhill Avenue was walking through the park with his friends on Sunday when a toddler slipped into the duck pond.While other passers by looked on in shock, the Edmund Rice College boy leapt into action, jumping into the freezing water to pull the child out. Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month. We’re very, very proud of them. They are top class role models for the school. About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him. We were scared that he did it, but we’re very happy that he did.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pressure mounts for new school building for st josephs college","story":"EDUCATIONALISTS and local community leaders have called for a new school building for St Joseph’s College.Housed in the former St Monica’s Secondary School on the Ravenhill Road, local representatives believe stellar progress at the school is being hampered by its crumbling premises.The school, which opened in , is proud of its all-ability, Catholic ethos and its erse student body, but many believe it is time the school got the st century facilities it deserves to keep up with its growing pupil numbers.Speaking after addressing the school’s annual prize-givin, Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey called on education chiefs to fast-track a long-promised rebuild for St Joseph’s.“St Joseph#s’ exemplary inclusive approach is a source of pride for all in Belfast who value excellence in education,” she said. #Under the leadership of principal Michele McCormick, the school is going from strength to strength but the commitment of governors, staff and indeed pupils is not matched by the resources it commands.#Physical education amenities at the school have come in for fierce criticism from parents who say the tarmacadam car park in front of the school which doubles as a play area is an indictment of the existing facilities. And the contrast with the spanking new facilities of its Catholic grammar school neighbour, Aquinas College, has raised questions about the priorities of education chiefs.Principal Michele McCormick says the school’s results, particularly in Maths and English, are the best in Belfast in the non-selective sector. In , the school also won the Aisling Award for ‘Oustanding Achievement in Education’. “St Joseph’s has a warm, welcoming ethos and they pride themselves on the care and compassion the staff have for pupils and their determination and passion to achieve the best possible success for every child,” added the Lord Mayor.#St Joseph’s College is delivering a first-class, st century education to our young people. It’s time, therefore, that it was given the st century resources it needs to fully realise its mission.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “The Department does not maintain a prioritised list of schools in need of a new school build. When a major capital announcement is being planned, the education managing authorities are asked to providea list of schools that they consider most in need of a new build at that time. “Due to the many demands on the Department’s capital budget, when a call for proposals is made, all projects submitted by the Managing Authority are assessed under the Department’s protocol “Any school not announced must be selected through the formal ‘call for projects’ processit is to become eligible for a new build. Given the medium term budget uncertainty and the absence of a Minister, there are currently no plans for a further major capital investment announcement.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660616.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/cattle_prod_seized.jpg","title":"cow prod used on pedestrians in northern ireland town from passing vehicle","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Martin described how the \"very friendly fox\" had a weak spot for chocolate and no appetite for fruit. \"One of the ladies I play with always keeps food in her bag and she lted out a banana and tried to feed Donny, but she turned her nose up,\" Aileen recalled. \"I had a Nutella wafer bar so I gave it to her and she absolutely loved it - she would eat right out of your hand.\" The bountul supply of snacks ensured that Donny never made off with Aileens golf ball, but other players were not so lucky. Another avid golfer, who encountered the \"beautul\" fox for the last time just a few weeks ago, said Donny became a mascot for the club. \"She ran off with my ball a few times, but once she realised it wasnt food she dropped it - it was quite amusing and in my case always advantageous,\" he said. The golf enthusiast, who tees off on the prestigious course every Sunday, often witnessed players feeding Donny sausages which she enjoyed. \"There was a vet came to check up on her regularly and she always seemed to be in good health - she looked pretty good the last time I saw her.\"Animal rescuer Debbie Nelson managed to get the distressed vixen to a vet on Monday, but it was too late - Donny died in her arms a few hours later. Joyce McCammon, who said Donnys antics never did her round any harm, learned of the news on Thursday after noticing the wild animals absence on the green.\"It was very sad to hear about it,\" she said. Mrs McCammons husband Bert recalled how the daring fox once tried to run off with his club after picking it up by the handle. \"She didnt get very far,\" he added. The couple both agreed that they will cherish memories of close encounters with the \"majestic\" creature who will be missed by many."},{"url":null,"title":"new year honours sport stars head list of 97 northern ireland people given","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Think how many weeks income that represents for students.\"She said it was important that those who overpaid were reimbursed as a matter of urgency.\"We want to see moves to reduce student debt through the provision of additional public funding for student support and higher education,\" she added.\"Investing more in tertiary education will deliver signicant benefits to the economy by driving the economy with skills and qualications, while also helping remove barriers to people commencing courses.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said the arrangements had become \"ridiculous\", adding: \"The system is clearly broken.\" She said: \"This obviously isnt a one-off or a blip, the problem is getting worse with every passing year and unfortunately increasing numbers of graduates are getting caught up by it.\"Its ridiculous that the problem has been going on for so long and these latest figures would suggest that nothing whatsoever has been done to resolve it.\"Ms Barton called on the SLC to get to the root of the problem and sort it out.\"It is also long past time that the Government should step in and intervene, given its responsibilities,\" she added. The SLC said student loan over-repayments occur due to the nature of the Income Contingent Repaymentstudent loan repayment scheme, which has been in place since , where repayments are made through the UK tax system via Pay-As-You-Earn . ICR student loan repayments are collected through the UK tax system where borrowers remain in the UK. The SLC said it receives student loan repayment information annually from HMRC, and the result of this process means that some borrowers nearing the end of their repayments may over-repay. The SLC said it proactively contacts borrowers to advise them they have over-repaid their loan. It said thatan over-repayment is identied on a borrowers account, money over-repaid will be refunded, plus interest. The borrower can also contact SLC to request a refund. The SLC said it was working with HMRC to consider how repayment information can be shared more frequently between the two organisations.The SLC said the percentage of borrowers overpaying their loans had not increased signicantly since  .\"There is no need for customers to over-repay their loan,\" it said. \"Providing they have kept their contact details up to date on their online account, they will receive a letter from us when they are within  months of repaying the balance of their student loan account in full, inviting them to manage their final repayments by opting into our direct debit scheme. \"This moves them out of the PAYE scheme and on to a direct debit which means that their repayments stop immediately when their loan is repaid.\"The SLC said any person who goes into credit by £ or more in a particular year will be included."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37660589.ece/7cbe5/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Police_drink_driving_.jpg","title":"pictured drink driving blamed after car ends on roof on derry roundabout","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is suspected that strong winds may have helped the new arrivals cross the Irish Sea.The records continued at Mount Stewart with up to  red squirrels being recorded in , thanks to a restoration project led by rangers. In Strangford Lough, the seal population was thriving with a record  pups being born this year.Several bird species, however, reported poor breeding seasons.Terns in Strangford Lough were affected by a storm in June as well as predators like otters and gulls.The light-bellied brent goose peak count revealed only , birds in October, with just .% of them being young brent geese.There was an unusual sighting on one Strangford Lough island with a nesting pair of Mediterranean gulls.Some butterfly species suffered despite periods of good weather, including the small tortoiseshell, red admiral and comma, which the National Trust says may be because of parasites and pesticides, or they were affected by climate change.Dr David Bullock, head of species and habitat conservation at the National Trust, said: “This year’s unusual weather does give us some indication of how climate change could look and feel, irrespective of whether this year’s was linked to climate change. “It’s becoming less predictable every year to gauge what sort of weather we are likely to experience and what this means for our wildle.”Dr Bullock added: “We need to ensure that we continue to look after the land in our care and work with others to create joined up areas of the countryside, in effect nature corridors, to enable wildle to move around easilyneeded, to survive any type of weather.” "},{"url":null,"title":"government to help fund ivf treatment for couples struggling to conceive","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

present for the nurses who helped to save their lives.Saorlaith and Saoirse McLaughlin spent the first few weeks of their lives at Altnagelvin Hospital’s Neo Natal Intensive Care Unit .The girls were born six weeks prematurely and suffering from a potentially fatal complication called \"Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome,\" where one baby gets the majority of the blood flow and nutrients from the placenta.Their parents, Bob and Michelle, have since raised a staggering £, for the unit, with the help of their friends and work colleagues.This year alone, they raised over £, through a tattoo fun day and a sponsored walk.But the McLaughlin’s decided that as well as vital equipment for the ward they wanted some of the money to be spent on the nurses, who work so tirelessly for the tiny babies in their care.“This year we wanted to put a bit of focus on the nurses and let them know we appreciate everything they do for sick new borns in Derry and beyond and especially our own twin girls,” explained Bob.“We asked the nurses to give us a list of stuff they needed for their tea room and of course we added a few extras and we are also going to buy them a new three seater sofa.“We felt it was very important that the nurses should have everything they need to make decent food.“It’s not a lot but it will make a dference to them.”“We want them to know that people are thinking of them and appreciate what they do.“The NHS canteen is closed when they are on night sht and at the minute I think all they have is a kettle and a toaster.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“As my we says, when the parents go home at night we are leaving our babies in their care.”The couple gave the nurses a voucher for a fridge freezer, cups, plates, cutlery, glasses a George Foreman grill, a set of knives, a radio and a £ MS voucher.And next month, they will present a cheque for the remaining £, to be spent on frontline services at the unit.“It was fantastic to catch up with some of the lovely nurses who did so much for our girls Cathy McClafferty Bridgeen Devine and Ciara Doherty and they passed on their thanks for the generosity of the public“We’d like to give a big thank you to everyone who made this possible including Michael Kelly who held a fundraiser at the Tattoo Lounge in Rathmor Business Park in the twins’ honour.”The tattoo fun day and last weekend’s sponsored walk have raised over £,, which will be donated to the unit next month.Mr McLaughlin says his employers and colleagues at First Source have played a huge part in helping them raise the £, over the past three years.“The management have been so supportive,” he continued.“They pick their own charity every year, but they also help a lot of smaller charities and a lot of it goes under the radar because they don’t advertise it.“When I brought my sponsorship form for the walk into work I raised £, in just five hours.“That’s how generous people in First Source are, there were people donating £ and £.”Picture Saorlaith and Saoirse

The bumper pre-match lunch crowd were less than keen to brave the elements, but a few hardy souls cheered the team on.Johnny McPhillips was released by Ulster late on Friday night and he started the match with Ryan Wilson ping to the bench. Ulster flyer Iwan Hughes also made his debut on the wing and Peter Nelson continued at full back.Kyle McCall ed at loose head, but his brother Zac was ruled out with Clayton Milligan taking his place at hooker. Malone looked strong with Ross Kane, Joe Dunleavey, Peter Cooper, Adam McBurney and Matthew Dalton all released by Ulster to bolster their forward pack.The wind was blowing across the pitch and this did not really favour either side. However, it did make things even more dficult as the rain was relentless and conditions underfoot were fairly treacherous.No one expected a classic and Ballynahinch had a little more composure in the key moments to secure a vital win. Local knowledge certainly helped with Nelson providing a masterclass in tactical kicking throughout, using his big left boot to keep his forwards on the front foot and dig his team out of trouble.Two McPhillips penalties and a typical Ross Adair finish following a Kyle McCall break had Ballynahinch - up at the break and they were well worth their lead.Malone turned the screw in the second half and when they scored a penalty try following a collapsed scrum under the lsquoHinch posts to close the gap to - with around  minutes the game could have slipped away from the home side, especially as McCall was sin-binned at the same time.However, the  man defence held out, and with the outstanding John Donnan laying waste to the Malone line out, the locals held out in relative comfort for another tight derby win.The next AIL fixture is away at Malone for the next instalment of the double-header on January .Ballynahinch will hope to have some players back from injury as the season reaches a crucial stage.The Ulster derbies look likely to decide the shape of the table and lsquoHinch will be away from home for three out of four in the second half of the season.Brian McLaughlin and his coaching staff will be plotting over the break to gain any advantage in the race for promotion.Ballynahinch Malone AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£250k Lottery Funding boost to restore Castlewellan park  ","story":"MAJOR plans to restore Castlewellan Forest Park to its former glory as part of a signicant investment programme have received a major pre-Christmas boost.The Heritage Lottery Fund confirmed yesterday that it is to provide almost pound, to help with ambitious redevelopment proposals which are being spearheaded by Newry, Mourne and Down Council in conjunction with the Forest Service.Fund officials had made it clear that the application process was very competitive, with council officials delighted they had made a persuasive argument to secure the cash they require.The local authority is also in the process of making a separate pound, bid to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to assist with the work at the forest park.

Electoral Office to scrap draft proposals that will result in people who live in Crossgar not being able to vote in the village at next Mayrsquos Newry, Mourne and Down Council election.Public consultation on the draft proposal mdash whichimplemented will mean residents have to make their way to nearby Drumaghlis or Killyleagh to cast their vote mdash ends today at pm.A revised proposal will then be published early in the New Year with a further  days then set aside for public comment before a final scheme is published.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews, who appealed to voters in Crossgar concerned about not being able to vote in their home village to respond to the consultation, hopes ldquocommon sense will prevail.He and a number of his Rowallane colleagues remain concerned that people who live within touching distance of the designated polling station at Glasswater Primary School, will have to make their way either to a church hall in Drumaghlis or Killyleagh Integrated Primary School.The local politicians say it is somewhat ironic that people who live on the periphery of Crossgar will be able to vote in the village, but those who live in the heart of the village will not.They believe the Electoral Officersquos draft proposal is ldquoflawed and have warned it will particularly impact on the elderly and those who have no access to public transport.Cllr Andrews said the draft proposal will have a ldquodetrimental effect on the people of Crossgar and district.ldquoResidents in the centre of the village will have to bypass Glasswater Primary School polling station and travel three miles to vote in Drumaghlis or five miles the other way to Killyleagh, he continued.ldquoIn my opinion, this draft proposal is senseless, flawed and discriminatory and treats Crossgar residents like second class citizens. What do people who have no access to transport do when it comes to casting their vote Cllr Andrews said that with an estimated population of , people, voters in Crossgar were being treated dferently to those in Killyleagh, Saintfield and Ballynahinch.ldquoI hope this proposal will be revisited so people in Crossgar and the surrounding district can enjoy the right of exercising their democratic right to vote in their own village, something many others take for granted where in the district, he declared.ldquoThe bottom line is thatyou live in Crossgar and intend to vote in next yearrsquos council elections you will have to travel either three miles to Drumaghlis or five miles to Killyleagh which simply isnrsquot on.He added: ldquoI sincerely hope common sense prevails and that this ridiculous draft proposal will be consigned to the bin where it belongs.ldquoWhat is really ironic is that while people in Crossgar must travel outside the village to vote, those in areas including Annacloy and Bells Hill will be heading into Crossgar to cast their vote.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning unsorted black bin bag waste which will have a signicant impact, given that thousands of people regularly empty a iety of waste into such bags and take them to the recycling centres.Elsewhere, council officials want to challenge the perception that the household centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.Officials say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the local authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling facilities.The review also examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive. The number of recycling centres and their opening hours will also come under the microscope during next monthrsquos workshop.The event will explore the reviewrsquos recommendations and agree an implementation date, with the agreed way forward to be mapped out at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s farewell to Hugh  ","story":"SPA Golf Club brought a unique six-decade era to a close on Saturday when its longest playing member Hugh Hegan left for pastures new.Club captain in  and president two years ago Hugh has been a keen and regular competitor on the Spa fairways since his father mdash also called Hugh mdash introduced him to the sport in .Captivated by golf from the very beginning, Hugh played to a handicap of two at his peak and along the way established himself as one of the leading contenders at Spa.Over the years Hugh, who now has a highly respectable handicap of , has won many trophies including the Spa Cup mdash as a teenager in lsquo mdash Captainrsquos Day events and represented the club on Senior Cup, Junior Cup and Ulster Cup teams.As he said farewell to his many friends at Spa, before leaving for St Andrewrsquos in Scotland with his we Anne to be closer to their daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren, Hugh reflected on the changes to the club which he will always call home.ldquoWhen I joined it was just a nine-hole course at the old Spa.ldquoThe facilities were basic to say the least.

You had Enniskillen. These are not failures of our making.“These are things that happen within Northern Ireland where your security forces operate. There is no way we can patrol  miles.”Mrs Thatcher, who became increasingly exasperated during the meeting added: “I don’t know what to do about the border.”She went on to say she was disappointed in the SDLP and John Hume: “They have the gt of the gab, but no, they won’t talk to their people and tell them to join the RUC.

The savagery was unbelievable.“I will never be prepared to walk out and let the terrorists win.”A press release issued after the meeting said that “a great deal of useful work had been done” between the two leaders.The meeting came in a particularly tense time for the two leaders as Mrs Thatcher had written to the Taoiseach in April telling him she was “deeply upset” at speeches he had made in New York and Hard.“You seem to be arguing that the persistence of violence actually calls into question the existence of Northern Ireland as an entity. To me, such an admission would be tantamount to a surrender to terrorism,” the letter read.Mr Haughey had made it clear to the British leader in a secret message four days before the meeting that he utterly rejected violence.“As an Irishman it has always been a matter of deep regret for me that Ireland is ided.“A united Ireland could not come about through violence, and every act of bloodshed on this island sets back further the date when what I hope for most deeply can be achieved.”try catch  TrendingNew Year Honours: Northern Irelandrsquos full list revealedSadness at death of lsquocaring and compassionatersquo RUC welfare championDeclassied files: Margaret Thatcher blasted Irish failure to extradite IRA priest suspectDeclassied files: lsquoWe should quit NI and let Irish butcher one anotherrsquoDeclassied files: Just one thin file, with pages removed, on Mull of Kintyre Chinook crash          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flat1.jpg","title":"belfasts flatiron building takes on first tenants","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew A design agency has become the first tenant of a newly renovated Victorian listed building with another business expected to become the second soon, Ulster Business can reveal.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house1.jpg","title":"ulster rugby player developing luxury homes","story":"Posted on Friday  December  by John Mulgrew A series of new luxury homes are being developed by an Ulster Rugby player in east Belfast, Ulster Business can reveal.Craig Gilroy, alongside developer Austin Baird, is currently building two large detached properties on a site at his home close to the Belmont Road.Work is under way on the properties, which will include a five-bedroom and six-bedroom development.“One of the properties is around , sq ft and the other , sq ft – we are still working on a price,” Mr Gilroy said.“The market seems to be pretty good, looking at the other properties in the area.”He said the properties will come to market in the next few weeks.
