The thrust of that novel resides in the war of nerves between Humble and Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield, the senior investigating officer in the Ripper investigation. Oldfield infamously fell so hard for Humble’s hoax that he ignored key evidence from Ripper survivors in pursuit of his own mistaken quest for Wearside Jack.In Blacklock’s new novel, the gritty reality of late 20th-century urban deprivation is replaced by the more outwardly sedate, conservatively hidebound milieu of late 19th-century intellectual bohemia, familiar to modern readers only through the tinted lens of period drama. Hinton manages not only to keep faith with the principles of what Blacklock has referred to as “documentary realism” laid out in I’m Jack, but to expand and consolidate the author’s overarching project as a writer. As with the baseline biographical details assembled in I’m Jack, readers curious enough to check the dates on the timeline in Hinton will discover that all of them tally with recorded history: Blacklock is leading us once again into the uneasy liminal space between fact and fiction.British mathematician Charles Howard Hinton was born in 1853, the son of James Hinton, a pedagogue-philosopher and an early advocate of polyamory. He grew up surrounded by men and women of letters whose enthusiasms flowed freely, firing him with a similar zeal for learning. Combined with his own precocious talent for mathematics, he looked set for a stellar career in the sciences. In 1880, Hinton married Mary Edith Boole, daughter of George Boole the mathematician. Mary soon became pregnant, giving birth in 1882 to George, the first of four sons. Early in 1883, Hinton bigamously married Maud Florence, who at the time was carrying his twins. When the deception became known, he surrendered himself to police and was sentenced to three days’ imprisonment. His career ruined, he was forced to emigrate, first to Japan and then to America where, away from the scene of his misadventures, his reputation gradually recovered.Hinton died of a stroke in 1907, at the age of 53. In the US, he was briefly famous as the inventor of the world’s first mechanical baseball pitcher. In the world of science fiction, he has been more broadly influential for the stories and short novels he based on his 1883 essay “What is the Fourth Dimension?” an early theory of what might now be recognised as quantum geometry. Hinton referred to his tales as “scientific romances”, and there is a strong likelihood that HG Wells was influenced by Hinton in his own later popularising of the term, as well as his enthusiasm for similar ideas – Hinton’s 1895 novella “Stella”, for example, introduces the theme of invisibility expanded on by Wells in The Invisible Man. Hinton’s obsession with Edwin Abbot’s 1885 proto-science fiction novel Flatland resulted in the 1907 homage An Episode of Flatland, which in its preoccupation with temporal and spatial dimensions has left a lasting influence on multiple generations of science fiction writers, from HP Lovecraft to Rudy Rucker.In spite of his achievements, Hinton’s name has drifted into obscurity, and the bald facts of his life provide only the framework for Blacklock’s imaginative reconstruction of a personality that both defied and was ultimately overmastered by the social and intellectual conventions of his time. Indeed, it would be more accurate to say that Hinton is a novel of multiple personalities, tracing not only one adventurous life but filling in the shadowy biographical outlines of his family and descendents, a still-extending line of figures who seem equally extraordinary.The overarching subject of Hinton lies in the problem of genius, not only for the ostracised radical possessed of it but for those caught in his tailwind, experiencing the gradual erosion of their autonomy and mental wellbeing. Thus the emotional heartland of Blacklock’s novel belongs to its supporting cast. Both Hinton’s wives were intellectually and creatively gifted, women denied their full potential through a frustrating combination of society and circumstance, while the attention afforded by Blacklock to Mary’s four children offers up some of the novel’s most mesmerising and immersive writing. They exist in a rarefied atmosphere of learning and scholarly opportunity, yet what most flourishes in each of them is a yearning for escape, for self-realisation in a world that appears to be missing a dimension.The artistry of Hinton appears seamless, the imagined sections so well in tune with their contemporary source material that we believe in them utterly. Equally, Blacklock’s introduction of unadulterated source materials into the text, most notably letters exchanged between Havelock Ellis, Olive Schreiner and other members of statistician Karl Pearson’s Men and Women’s Club (a forum for freethinkers that flourished during the 1880s) grants the illusion of incontrovertible reality, even as elusive missing pieces deny us closure.From the remarkable facts about the Hintons, Blacklock weaves a distinct and original fiction, a fittingly four-dimensional representation of lived reality. Questions of societal convention versus inidual freedom and Classical enlightenment versus Romantic self-expression play themselves out against a backdrop that, as we familiarise ourselves with its complexities, jumps glowingly to life. This is a dense, multilayered, knotty book, demanding the reader’s full cooperation. But Blacklock’s attention to detail, his imaginative reach, not to mention his willingness to wrestle with problems of geometry, have produced a singular literary achievement.• Hinton by Mark Blacklock is published by Granta (£16.99).

Her attacker claimed in court that “he had been ignored by women a lot and couldn’t bear it any more”.Months later, a slim novel called Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, was published. Written by former screenwriter Cho Nam-joo, the book details the life of an “every woman” and the sexism she experiences in a deeply male-dominated society. Though it preceeded #MeToo by a year, Cho’s novel became a rallying cry for South Korean women when the movement took off there in 2018. In one of the country’s most famous #MeToo cases, a junior prosecutor, Seo Ji-hyeon, quoted Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 while accusing her boss – during a TV interview – of sexual misconduct . Female celebrities who mention the novel have been subjected to abuse male fans of South Korean all-female pop group Red Velvet burned photos and albums singer Irene when she said she was reading it. A bill against gender discrimination was even proposed in the book’s name.Four years after its original publication, Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 has been translated into English. While Cho’s focus is on South Korean culture, the normalisation of violence and harassment in the book seems all too familiar.“In the first draft, there were episodes of domestic violence, dating violence, and abortion, but eventually I deleted them,” Cho says. “This is because I wanted male readers to be immersed in this novel without feeling rejected or defensive. I cannot understand the hysterical reaction some men still have to this novel, despite my efforts.”Women of Kim Jiyoung’s generation live in a time where physical abuse and discrimination are illegal, yet violent culture and customs remain four out of five Korean men admit to abusing their girlfriends, according to the Korean Institute of Criminology, while aborting female babies remains common practice, says Cho. “I wanted to talk about invisible, non-obvious violence and discrimination, often considered insignificant – which is difficult to bring up or even to be recognised by women themselves.”Cho is not the only South Korean author tackling gendered violence. Her novel is part of an emerging literary tradition, with titles including Ha Seong-nan’s Flowers of Mold, Jimin Han’s A Small Revolution, and Yun Ko-eun’s The Disaster Tourist (to be published in English in May). Han Kang’s International Booker prizewinner The Vegetarian, like Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982,follows a seemingly unremarkable woman, who withdraws from abuse inflicted by her father and husband into psychosis.Beauty and brutality have long been entangled in South Korean literature. But while violence was previously explored in literature through the masculine world of war, feminist authors are examining another kind of violence that is far more female. South Korea has the highest rate of plastic surgery per capita in the world. In The Vegetarian, two sisters are juxtaposed: the unconventional vegetarian of the title, and her older sibling, whose “eyes were deep and clear, thanks to the double-eyelid surgery she’d had in her 20s” her cosmetic store’s success is attributed to “the impression of affability” that surgery has given her.Dusapin’s debut, Winter in Sokcho, translated from French by Aneesa Abbas Higgins, is narrated by an unnamed woman working in a guesthouse where one guest is recovering from plastic surgery. “I could see the wounds weeping as the skin was exposed,” she observes. “Her eyebrows hadn’t grown back yet. She looked like a burn victim, the face neither a man’s nor a woman’s.” In spite of such a graphic deterrent, the narrator’s mother, aunt and boyfriend all attempt to convince her to have operations of her own.There’s a word in Korean that has no direct English translation: han. Cha defines it as a “resentment and anger that’s built up over being unfairly treated”. “A lot of women in my life have that. Mothers-in-law tend to have it because they were daughters-in-law and were mistreated by their own mothers-in-law. It’s been a very vicious cycle historically,” Cha says.In novels such as Ch’oe Yun’s There a Petal Silently Falls and Park Wansuh’s Who Ate Up All the Shinga?, female authors have explored the violence, psychological and otherwise, inflicted after conflicts such as the 1980 Gwangju massacre and the Korean war. “Violence is a big theme in Korean culture in general, it’s not just women. The ‘han’ is more skewed to women. I think the violence – because everyone is on such good behaviour in polite society – is a release of all the pent-up emotions of every day,” Cha suggests.Sales of Korean fiction overseas have exploded, and female authors are now outnumbering males in translation. While Cho stresses that there are many excellent contemporary male authors, more women are being nominated for Korean literary awards at a time when “feminist stories are coming more to the forefront globally”.“During the recession, many novels were about the pain and anxiety of fathers and young men,” Cho says. “Recently, readers love stories about the lives of older women, books that focus on the social life and concerns of female workers, express sympathy between female colleagues, friends, and neighbours … themes that weren’t considered as a subject of literature are now covered.” • In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

But scientists may be made the real scapegoatsWhen Boris Johnson was recovering in hospital after his admission to intensive care, he was advised not to work. There was no suggestion this time from No 10 that he would even be supplied with a red box. The prime minister’s decision to work remotely following his coronavirus diagnosis seemed misjudged given how he deteriorated, so there was an effort to get him to watch films rather than look at paperwork. However, he did manage to call a handful of ministers – one of whom was Matt Hancock.The beleaguered health secretary has been in the news this week as a potential “fall guy” for the government over its handling of coronavirus. Among the hostile briefings, a No 10 source complained to the  that Hancock’s promise in a press conference earlier this month of 100,000 tests by the end of the month would “come back to bite him” and suggested the figure was “arbitrary”. Meanwhile, senior Tories are speculating that he will be moved from his brief before any public inquiry.While Hancock is the minister most clearly in the firing line, there has been a change over the past week. As the prime minister’s health has improved, MPs and ministers have become more loose-lipped when it comes to concerns over the government strategy and lockdown – with senior Tories kicking off about the economic impact of lockdown and a growing cabinet debate over the exit strategy.In recent weeks, there has been annoyance within the government at the 100,000 test target. When Hancock made that promise at a press conference in early April, it followed a few days of bad headlines for the government which included mixed messaging and an uninspiring performance from the business secretary, Alok Sharma, the day before.Hancock’s high energy performance, after which he took follow-up questions from assembled journalists for the first time, won immediate plaudits from the media. But it irked many who had been working behind the scenes and in other departments. There was a sense that the health secretary was enjoying the limelight a little too much.This Downing Street likes to pride itself on not dancing to the media’s tune, but announcing a timelined target was seen in some quarters as an example of doing just that. Although the prime minister had previously spoken about 250,000 tests, he had not given the same hard deadline. While the government still believes it could reach 100,000 capacity by the end of the month, getting that many people to take the tests will be more difficult. At the moment, around half the capacity is going unused each day. And any failure on testing will be used to paint a picture of a government on the back foot over coronavirus.While Hancock may not be minister of the month – he’s also not enemy No 1. And in the weeks ahead, No 10 and the Department of Health are likely to form an important alliance when it comes to the exit strategy. The expectation in the government is that so long as his recovery continues, it will now be the prime minister who makes the final decision on easing lockdown in a few weeks.When it comes to the whole cabinet – not just the four ministers (Hancock, Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove) who lead the coronavirus subcommittees – it is currently weighted in favour of a significant easing of lockdown measures in three weeks’ time.One of the reasons Hancock has received a hostile reception from his cabinet colleagues is that he is viewed as the chief lockdown “dove” of the cabinet – the minister who is the most cautious about easing any restrictions. This is in many ways natural as his brief is health – just as so-called hawk Sunak’s is the economy.Inside the government there is frustration that the ministers not involved in the day-to-day decisions have taken to knocking those who are in the engine room. “There are two types of people during a pandemic: those who spend all their time dealing with a pandemic and those who aren’t involved and spend their time complaining,” says a government source.Hancock could soon have an important ally in the prime minister. While Johnson is not back in Downing Street, he has met with his top team and is said to be very cautious about easing the lockdown. Ministers who had thought Johnson’s return would help the cause of the hawks look set to be disappointed. Although there is still an expectation of some movement, the priority is avoiding a second peak of cases.While Hancock looks set to have support in the coming weeks, there’s another reason to expect him not to be the scapegoat in any government inquiry. Blaming a Tory minister in that forum would be an implicit acceptance that the whole strategy was flawed. “It won’t be blue-on-blue,” says one government figure.Instead, as becomes clearer with each press conference and each rebuttal, any defence will be focused on the scientific guidance. Already there are concerns among scientists that they could be in the firing line. The Tories in the line of fire are more likely to be figures from the Theresa May ministry. Questions are being repeatedly asked about the lack of government preparedness for a pandemic – but much of that goes back a few years.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe42143dd4e5141b20e9eb3671373aff3d2b2f7/86_104_3254_1953/master/3254.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68e3f2532b9af5dd461d755829999dfa","title":"schools and exam boards undermine promise to pupils of september tests","story":"Government assurance candidates in all subjects can choose a delayed exam unravels A row is brewing between examination boards, schools, the government and England’s exam regulator over whether pupils unhappy with their assessed GCSE or A-level grades will have the chance to sit the exams in autumn, as promised.When the Department for Education and Ofqual, the exam regulator, announced that this summer’s GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled and replaced with assessed grades, students were told they would have the option to take the exams “as soon as reasonably possible” after schools reopen following the summer holidays.But that promise – repeated by the education secretary, Gavin Williamson – is in danger of being undermined by a reluctance among exam boards to create a costly set of extra exams if schools discourage pupils from taking part.The boards also fear that subjects with only a small number of entries, such as modern languages including Arabic and Japanese, would see only a handful of pupils wanting to sit exams in the autumn.Ofqual said decisions on which exams will be offered is up to inidual exam boards, although that could change, depending on a consultation. “Unless we decide otherwise, the default position will be that exam boards will decide which exams to make available to students in the autumn series,” the regulator said.Such a decision would run counter to directions given by Williamson, who told Ofqual in a ministerial letter dated 31 March: “The government considers that students who do not feel their calculated grade reflects their ability should be afforded an opportunity to sit an exam at the earliest reasonable opportunity.“Accordingly, I hereby direct Ofqual to take account of this policy and work with the exam boards and others to plan to enable this group of students to sit exams as soon as reasonably possible after schools and colleges are open again.”However, some head teachers are opposed to having pupils sit GCSE exams in their first term as sixth formers, arguing that this is “totally impractical” and would interfere with pupils learning the A-level or BTec subjects they had just begun to study.The rebel heads also say that a full suite of exams in October or November would further disrupt school life, taking teachers out to act as assessors and examiners, or forcing them to oversee revision.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), which mainly represents secondary school heads, said it favoured only GCSE maths and English exams and those for major A-level subjects being offered before Christmas.Geoff Barton, the ASCL’s general secretary, told TES, which first reported the move: “Other GCSEs are very important for progression but they are superseded by other qualifications taken later down the line, while GCSE English and maths, and A-levels, have an enduring significance for the inidual.“It would, therefore, seem reasonable that in the current circumstances an opportunity is provided to sit these exams in the event that a student is unhappy with the grade awarded in the summer.”Failing to hold the extra exams would mean that pupils unhappy with their assessed grades – which will be administered by the exam boards and Ofqual using teacher recommendations – would have no means to improve them until GCSEs or A-levels in spring 2021. Appeals are only allowed against the process followed, not the grades themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722bc0ce96f29a8ed2ef8ec6401aeb581b4f6a71/0_299_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cb45028a7fe99396e9d359de629845b","title":"is old yeast ok the 17 rules of expiry dates from eggs to meat to oils","story":"Use-by dates are a food-safety matter so you should always take them seriously. Here’s a guide to where you do – and definitely don’t – have some leewayThis was, of course, all overshadowed, by the coronavirus outbreak but the use-by date controversy has never been more up to date. The cook, author and campaigner Jack Monroe runs ad hoc advice sessions called Lockdown Larder on Twitter, and says: “Since I’ve been doing it, by a country mile the most-asked question I’ve had is: ‘I’ve got this yeast, it went out of date two months ago, can I use it? I’ve got these sardines, they went out of date a year ago, can I use them?’ People want someone they perceive to be an expert to reassure them. As a species, we seem to have lost the ability to trust our own senses.”This gets to the core of the matter. If you want a blanket rule for everyone, the use-by date is that rule. I can only tell you what I would eat. If it happens to be the same as Theresa May (who famously admitted to scraping the mould off jam), that’s just coincidence.Erik Millstone, emeritus professor of science policy at the University of Sussex, lays out the ground rules: ignore sell-by dates. “Those are a guidance by the retailers for the retailers, so they can manage their stock. The indications concerning food safety, particularly microbiological food safety, that’s use-by dates.” But are all use-by dates created equal?Eggs, strictly speaking, don’t have a use-by date but a best-before-end (BBE), which is mostly to do with quality and taste rather than safety. Either way, this is a hill I’m prepared to die on: dates are irrelevant to eggs, because of the float test. Drop the egg in a glass of water. If it floats to the surface, it’s definitely off. If it sits flat on its side, it’s definitely fresh. If it sits vertically, it’s somewhere between fresh and off (I would still eat it). A fully off egg will also smell disgusting, but you can save yourself that trauma by conducting this test.The sulphurous smell of an off egg triggers a useful disgust mechanism, because the bacterium causing it – Pseudomonas – can be injurious. Salmonella is far more dangerous, being undetectable, but British hens are inoculated.If a bread past its BBE date is mouldy, or smells of mould, don’t eat it. Don’t just chop off the mouldy bit, because there is a twilight when mould spores are present but not yet visible. Mould on bread isn’t the most dangerous of the fungi, but it’s still revolting.I remember being astonished to read (in Delia) that you should do a complete spice overhaul every year, because they won’t taste as good. As I have spices that are older than my children this seemed extremely wasteful. There are spices that most cooks won’t get through in a year (za’atar) unless you live with Yotam Ottolenghi. But Delia’s right, if you want them to last longer, buy them whole and grind yourself to order, or go back in time and store them in brown rather than clear glass.Ah, this is where things get interesting. Millstone says: “Some of the compounds formed from mould can be seriously toxic, especially aflatoxins, which can be carcinogenic.” These are found on mouldy grain and nuts.You can’t buy dangerous grains and nuts (because of that blasted EU), but you should take very seriously the use-by date on what you have bought. There is no meaningful trade-off between risk now and cancer later. It’s not like pharmaceuticals it’s just a bar snack.Some time before anything goes mouldy, it may go a bit grey (if it started out green) or just a murkier version of itself (if it started out red). This is plain pigment oxidisation and is not dangerous, though it is a bit unappetising – if the fat has oxidised, you will be able to smell it.Monroe raises the stakes here: “I’ve personally used yeast that is 10 years out of date. But it’s not been opened, and was stored away from direct light in cool conditions. It didn’t rise as well as normal yeast would. If you’re using old yeast, I would always recommend using 1.5 times the amount the recipe states, leave it for an extra hour, and if you’re really running low on flour, make a quarter batch, then if it doesn’t rise, or doesn’t go so well, you can work it into a soda bread and you’re not going to waste half a bag of what is currently quite a precious resource.”Baking powder and bicarbonate of soda typically have shelf lives of one to two years, but storage is more important than numbers, and there is a school of thought that says bicarb lasts for ever. Yup, for ever.These are “particularly vulnerable to bacterial spoilage,” Millstone says, “and if it smells off, it’s definitely off.” However, some forms of spoilage are smellier than others, so just because it doesn’t smell doesn’t mean it’s safe. “If I had a piece of chicken one day past its use-by date,” Millstone continues, I wouldn’t simply barbecue it and eat it, but I might put it in a casserole and cook it at a high temperature for quite a long time.”Vulnerability to rottenness is partly about surface area – how much the meat has come into contact with the outside world, and how much of it is subject to direct heat while you’re cooking. This is why mince is such a minefield, because it has a huge surface area, and if you’re cooking a burger medium rare, the middle won’t have been thoroughly cooked. A whole bird has a much smaller surface area. Game birds are a subtle enterprise, the window between how it’s supposed to smell and “off” being so narrow. It’s eater-beware in this case.Salt, naturally, has a preservative effect, and the sniff and overall appearance test should work with things such as salami. These things have a pretty good shelf life to begin with, and are very low effort (you don’t have to cook them, you just have to pop them in your mouth). So there is something to be said for using your memory rather than your judgment. Eat them before the use-by date, and you won’t have to play ham-roulette.The food safety scene is united on this – nothing with mould should be consumed, except where it has been introduced deliberately (blue cheese). It does, however, seem a bit absurd, if you have a jam with a bit of mould on, stuffed with sugar so you know it’s fine underneath, to have to chuck the whole lot out. Millstone is slightly forgiving on this. “If there’s a bit of mould on the top surface of jam that can be safely removed, then the jam lower down might well be safe. But if the entire top surface is covered in mould, you should discard it.” Pesto will taste rank if it’s mouldy as pine nuts go rancid very fast.Again, frozen, tinned and dried food gets a BBE date rather than a use-by date. You can sail past the BBE on dried fruit by as much as a year, though the higher the water content, the less time you have – figs and dates won’t last as long as currants and raisins. Do yourself a favour, though, and taste these things if they are very old. If they no longer taste of themselves, that’s just a waste of calories.Certain oils (walnut, sesame) seem to go off much faster than others (vegetable, olive oil) but this is usually because we don’t use them fast enough. The smell and taste of a rancid oil is subtle but very insistent, and you can easily ruin a whole dish with a very small amount of it. Don’t give it the benefit of the doubt smelling it, tasting it, smelling it again, not wanting to chuck it out because it was expensive. It’s much more wasteful to ruin more food than to throw it away.We think of these as forever foods, but by the end of the best-before date, they will be tough and won’t taste as good. Vexingly, they will have toughened at different rates within the packet, so it will be impossible to adjust your cooking times for toughness without some of them going mushy. Stick with the guidelines.Your real enemy is the weevil. Some people say just sift them out, others (Millstone) remind us that you don’t know what else those bugs have been crawling over.Hard cheeses are less vulnerable to mould and bacteria than soft ones, since their higher salt content has a protective effect. All bets are off for cheeses in which the mould is deliberate. Those are delicious. I would happily saw the mouldy end off a cheddar and eat the rest. Milk has the fabulous trait of smelling awful – and shortly after that, separating – to warn you that it’s off. Yoghurt is the great unknown (I have never met anybody who takes yoghurt use-by dates seriously). Monroe will eat a yoghurt a week after its expiration. I once found one at the bottom of my daughter’s school bag, decided it would probably be fine, and it exploded. So don’t listen to me (on this one occasion).These new fangled milks will keep in pantry conditions for several months, then for seven days in the fridge. There hasn’t been a huge amount of consumer experimentation the best anecdotal evidence is that they lose their flavour, rather than becoming disgusting. Oat milk is lower in fat and higher in sugar, so will last longer. Almond milk won’t have a very strong smell, even if it’s off, so taste it tentatively.Best-before dates on crisps are so long, and crisps themselves so delicious, that it’s actually quite hard to find any that are out of date. Monroe got some two-year-out-of-date Doritos from a vending machine the other day (“Were they the best Doritos I’ve ever had? Probably not, but they were fine”) I had some Quavers this morning that should have been eaten by February. They are loaded with salt and preservatives. Probably the worst they can bring is disappointment, of not being crunchy enough.The best-before dates on cans range between three and five years from purchase, but this is essentially a way of saying “for ever, all things being equal” – if you’re dealing in units of half a decade, you’re not really talking about the food perishing, but rather the tin. Acidic foods such as tinned tomatoes can attack the can from the inside. Otherwise, rust, dents, any attack on its structural integrity can interfere with its powers of preservation. If you have a tin with a dent in it, even if you can clearly remember the time you dropped it, it’s still better not to eat it. I once had some Swedish anchovies that swelled up like a bloater fish. I don’t know how that happened, but I didn’t try to eat them.Jack Monroe’s Good Food for Bad Days is out at the end of May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74b02fae99c19e5a8ec7809eba0d4c52a0cef1ac/0_2120_5398_3239/master/5398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08fe963685ee82b4a9d90db120c289de","title":"nigel slater simple store cupboard recipes for lockdown","story":"Five of his favourite recipes that offer comfort and familiarity, cut down on shopping and make use of ingredients you might already have to handIt is taking forever to do the food shopping. At first, finding a time when the queues will be at their shortest joining the queue, suitably distancing myself from the next shopper, then, when finally inside the shop, trying to avoid getting close to others mulling over which piece of Parmesan to buy. And then, I start all over again at the next shop.To reduce my trips to the absolute minimum (I’ve been taking lockdown very seriously) I have been raiding my own store-cupboard at home and hunkering down on the carbs I have in store. I have probably eaten more beans, pasta and rice during lockdown than I did in the whole of last year. But that has been a good thing, reminding myself of dishes I may not have cooked in a while stuff that might initially feel a little unseasonal, yet is strangely just what I need in times such as these. Much-loved recipes, cheap ingredients and food that offers a sense of comfort and familiarity.I have dug out a number of archive recipes that have fitted in quite neatly with this new way of life. All rely very much on what is in the cupboard, with a few bits and bobs from the shops: a butternut squash cooked on the hob with butter beans and thyme some crisp cakes of chickpeas and spinach (the greens came in my veg box but I could have used frozen) onions with miso butter that we ate with rice and a cheddar and potato mash that we’ve tucked into with sausages, and on another occasion, with asparagus.I can’t find plain flour for love nor money, so I have been baking apples with marmalade and the dregs of the sherry bottle instead, and yesterday made a version where I mashed the apples after cooking and stirred them into whipped cream to make a version of fruit fool. I may be in lockdown, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to do without pudding.Any gold-fleshed squash is suitable for cooking in stock. It is a good idea to brown the pieces first, so the caramelised notes lend a sweet depth to the broth. I use butter beans for their beefy texture, but haricot beans or cannellini are suitable here, too.Potatoes, especially the large baking variety, have been a godsend during lockdown. I have been making mountains of mash, very often with cooked greens or chopped, crisply fried bacon folded in. A great favourite has been this one, with crumbled cheese and roast shallots.Once the cakes have rested and firmed in the fridge, they should be lifted carefully into the sizzling oil using a palette knife, then left to form a thin, golden crust on the bottom before you attempt to turn them. Fiddling with them as they cook, although tempting, will result in them breaking up in the pan.Roast onions, bronzed by the oven, are one of those side dishes I have elevated to that of a main course, either by stuffing them with goat’s cheese and thyme or by serving them with a sauce, rice and a crisp accompaniment. The sweetness of their outer layers is a contrast to the deep, savoury quality of miso, and with a bed of brown rice this becomes a most satisfying dinner.There is something pleasing about basting food as it cooks, about spooning the cooking juices over it as your supper bakes. I do this two or three times during the 45 minutes or so it take the apples to bake. The sauce will thicken to a jammy consistency on the hob later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1812167b3b3f6f257561cad9b15e985fbcc8251f/347_18_1573_944/master/1573.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4aad6dd9c290cac8661676953e2d129b","title":"xcom chimera squad review pc 2k games","story":"PC 2K GamesIn the terrifying aftermath of an invasion from space, a motley band of superheroes must keep the peace in City 31Beginning where most disaster movies end – with cities ruined and civilisation in utter disarray – XCOM: Chimera Squad is about the horrifying aftermath of an alien invasion. Our heroic band of scientists and soldiers may have defeated the extraterrestrial conquerors at the end of acclaimed strategy sequel XCOM 2, but the world they won back is barely functioning. One squad member mentions that he’s from Canada before acknowledging that this was when such a thing existed. A mission briefing notes that hard cash is the only currency after the implosion of the global financial system.To complicate things further, the aliens are still here. The stranded remnants of the invasion force are trying their best to assimilate into human society, with varying degrees of success. And even the very notion of humanity is in flux thanks to the widespread creation of human-alien hybrids during the occupation.Chimera Squad takes place in City 31, which is not unlike the Los Angeles depicted in 1980s sci-fi franchise Alien Nation. In an experiment in integration, humans and aliens live alongside each other – and the city’s police force has to reflect the multi-species make-up of the people it’s protecting. Players must command a squad of human, alien and hybrid law enforcers, harnessing their various abilities to tackle a new threat to the city’s uneasy peace.Lizard woman Torque can lash out her tongue and yank enemies from across the map Axiom the Muton can race up to foes and pound them into meat with his fists and Verge, a former Thin Man (the infiltration arm of the alien’s invasion force), can access enemies’ minds and control them like puppets. After years of being tormented by these abilities in previous XCOM games, it’s wonderfully cathartic to finally use them for yourself.Then again, not much else has really changed. In essence, Chimera Squad is XCOM 2 with some genetic splicing. The base building is gone, although you’re still tasked with researching weaponry and training recruits in between fights, and the scope is limited to a single city rather than the whole planet. But now you have a permanent crew of unique characters, and battles are smaller and more finessed.Rather than attacking with your team then waiting with fingers crossed for the computer to have its go, in Chimera Squad you can see the order in which each combatant will make their move. This allows you to focus assaults on the enemy who will attack next, and even change the turn order with special moves. It’s satisfying to work your way through a room, methodically picking off the most urgent threats, although it does tend to make the game a little easier than its predecessor.Perhaps the most radical change is the introduction of a team of superheroes with unique abilities battles can play out very differently accordingly to which squad members you select. The flipside is that, unlike in XCOM 2, the characters cannot die. If they bleed out, you’re simply sent back to the last save. This takes away some of the tension of the previous games, all those times spent agonising over whether to press on or replay a lengthy level because one of your squad bought it at the end. Still, the little snippets of characterisation are welcome in what can be a clinical genre – although the developers could have gone further, perhaps adding crew-specific missions as in Mass Effect 2, or something akin to Fire Emblem’s relationship building.XCOM: Chimera Squad is essentially the Agents of Shield to XCOM 2’s Avengers. It gently plays with the formula, and tells the peripheral stories of a much wider world on a much tighter budget and with much smaller stakes. In other words, it’s XCOM but chilled – and, in these desperate times, that’s just fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

In reality he was born in what is now Turkey, died in modern-day Israel and never even considered stepping foot in England.English Heritage, which normally marks St George’s Day on 23 April with activities at its properties, is instead asking how well we really know St George.“Ordinarily we’d be having lots of events and having dragon slaying and all that sort of thing at various sites.” said English Heritage’s curatorial director, Anna Eavis.“We can’t do that this year but we thought it was interesting to reflect on what is known about the real man which is, of course, not very much.”Eavis said our ancestors repeatedly turned to St George during times of shared trauma and crisis, “including war, conflict and infectious diseases”.“How was it that he became a figure which resonated very strongly with all sorts of values of courage and valour and virtue associated with the identity of England?”George is hailed as an English hero but was in fact born, in the 3rd century AD, more than 2,000 miles away in Cappadocia, in modern-day Turkey. He is thought to have died in the Roman province of Palestine, in modern-day Israel, in AD303.He is often depicted as a courtly knight but is likely to have been an officer in the Roman army and it is here that his legend, as a Christian martyr, originated.During the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian in the early 4th century, the story goes that St George was executed for refusing to make a sacrifice in honour of the pagan gods.As many schoolchildren know, George also rescued a princess and slew a dragon. That chapter was, though, added about 500 years after his death, becoming particularly popular in the 13th century.The story goes that St George rode into a city in Libya, said to be Silene, which was tormented by a tyrannical dragon. George wounds the dragon, rescues the maiden, throws her girdle round its neck and marches it in to the city where he offers a deal: he’ll kill the dragon if the people convert to Christianity, which they do.It’s not difficult to see how the story became so popular, said Eavis. “It is a very compelling story. It is a very compelling image of good triumphing over evil and it also works in a military context, it is someone who is tremendously brave vanquishing what seems like an impossible enemy.”There is even a site in English Heritage’s portfolio which lays claim to being the place where George slew the dragon, a 10 metre high mound called Dragon Hill. “Clearly if he did it anywhere it was Libya, not Oxfordshire,” Eavis admitted.George became popular with English warrior kings in the middle ages, men such as Edward I, Edward III and of course Henry V, with Shakespeare having him call on the saint during his battle cry at the Battle of Harfleur: “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more … Cry ‘God for Harry, England, and Saint George’!”England has been turning to St George ever since. For example during the first world war there were soldiers who swore blind they saw his protective figure during their retreat from Mons and the naval commander who cited the saint as inspiration during the Zeebrugge raid.If English Heritage properties were open, visitors might travel to Farleigh Hungerford castle in Somerset and see a 15th century wall painting of St George in the chapel. Wrest Park in Bedfordshire would normally be hosting an action-packed weekend St George’s festival full of jousting and dragon slaying.None of that is possible, which is why English Heritage is instead using its ever-expanding History at Home hub to put out information on the real St George, a place where people can also learn how to apply make-up like a Roman or make soup like a Victorian.“We’re interested in exploring that things are not always being what they seem and the root of a story is not always what you expect,” said Eavis. “George – whether it’s the man or the saint – is a fascinating character.”• This article was amended on 23 April 2020.

Those in large families describe the frustrations, pressures and their quests for peace and quietAs the coronavirus lockdown continues, many of us holed up at home with family will be wondering how much more of it we can take. But what is it like if you have 11 kids or live with your extended family? We asked some of Britain’s biggest families how they are coping.Danielle Jackson, 36, is from Southend in Essex. She is a full-time parent to Allysha, 18, Mia, 16, Amelia, 14, Sophie, 13, Ruby, 10, and one-year-old twins Reid and Hunter“I’m finding it hard,” admits Danielle Jackson. She is a single parent: space and money are tight. (One of her daughters has to sleep on a sofa in the living room.) Danielle is on employment and support allowance due to her mental health condition, and her children are eligible for free school meals. Since the schools closed, Danielle has been given Tesco vouchers to cover their lunches. However, the queue to get into Tesco is more than an hour long, and Danielle doesn’t want to leave the kids at home alone for that long.“I’m having to ration our food,” Danielle says. “It’s difficult because, normally, the kids can just make themselves something to eat, but I have to be in control of all our meals now, to make sure we don’t run out. And the minute I go food shopping, the next day it’s all gone.” She has been issued food bank vouchers, but finding time to go is difficult.With so many children cooped up at home, there can be occasional fireworks. “It’s the arguments between them,” Danielle sighs. “That’s what does me. Especially the older ones, because they’re teenagers now. Having them at home is hard. They haven’t got a computer or anything to keep them entertained.”Danielle has stopped the children from watching the news. “I don’t want them to get scared,” she explains. “Not when it’s just me there to break it down to them and help them deal with it.” Normally Danielle’s mum and sister would help her with childcare, but due to the restrictions they have been unable to visit.Being at home alone with the kids has been psychologically challenging. “I have felt suffocated, and I think the kids have, too,” she says. But when it all gets too much, Danielle goes for night-time walks. “It’s peaceful,” she says. “I love it. No cars. You can hear the foxes and all the other animals that come out at night. When the sky is clear, you can see the stars. It’s lovely.”Tim Bhullar, 57, is a business owner from Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. He lives with his wife, Ravinder, 53, daughter Harneet, 26, son Inveer, 23, mother Charan, 87, and father Mohn, 90. His niece Nimrata, 21, was also staying with the family until last weekTim Bhullar usually wakes up at about 7am. But he doesn’t go downstairs until 11. “I just want to spend some time upstairs on my own,” he jokes. He usually listens to his daughter Harpreet’s radio show during this time – she lives in London, and presents the BBC Asian Network breakfast show.TV has become a big issue in the Bhullar house. “One kid wants to watch American films and the other wants to watch Sky Sports and my parents want to watch the Asian channels,” he says. To resolve conflict, Tim installed a TV in a bedroom, so that the children could watch what they wanted. But Tim’s parents missed having the kids around, so they relinquished control of the remote. “Now my dad gives my son the remote and says: ‘Here, put on whatever you want, come sit with us,’” Tim says. “Dad doesn’t mind watching Sky Sports, as long as we’re all together.”Due to their age, Tim’s parents are particularly at risk if they catch coronavirus. “I looked out of the window recently and Dad was standing at the top of the drive,” Tim says. “I asked him what he was doing and he said he wanted to get some air. I said: ‘That’s the furthest you’re going!’” No one is leaving the house, apart from shopping. “My son says: ‘When will this be over? I want to see my friends,’” Tim says. “I say: ‘You can’t see your friends! You’re handcuffed here because of your grandparents.’ But he’s taken it well.”Tim has imposed one crucial ground rule. “I don’t want my parents to get depressed, not at their age,” he says. “So I’ve told the kids: ‘If you want to be miserable, fine, but be miserable upstairs! When you come downstairs, be happy.’ I want everyone to take the lockdown in good spirits.”Griping aside, lockdown has brought the family closer together. “The kids are spending much more time with their grandparents than they would normally,” he says. “They have a better bond now. And I’ve been having Zoom calls in the evening with all our relatives abroad. That would never have happened before coronavirus. So it’s been nice in a lot of ways.”David Brett, 45, is a train driver from Dingwall in the Scottish Highlands. He lives with his wife, Alexis, 40, and their children, Campbell, 18, Harrison, 16, Corey, 14, Lachlan, 11, Brodie, 10, Brahn, 8, Hunter, 7, Mack, 6, Blake, 4, Rothagaith, 3, and Cameron, seven months“It has obviously been difficult,” shouts David Brett over the noise of his 11 children playing in the background. “Having them all in the house is a challenge. They start arguing over their toys or wanting to go on the laptop at the same time.”David has Parkinson’s disease, which puts him in the at-risk group for coronavirus. He has been off work for the past 12 weeks and has to follow strict social distancing guidance. “It’s made things hard,” he says, “because I’m the one who drives. Now Alexis has to do the shopping on her own, and carry it back , as they don’t let more than one person into the shop. And we’re not talking one or two small bags – she’s buying eight pints of milk a day! Luckily, she’s quite fit.”Being at home has given David a newfound respect for Alexis, who is a full-time parent. “I’ve always had enormous respect for her,” he says, “but it’s been an eye-opener as to what goes on when I’m at work.” Trying to manage the children’s screen time has been particularly difficult: David has been teaching them jiu-jitsu in their small garden, so the children get some exercise. When the family goes for a walk, they get funny looks. “People think we aren’t social distancing,” he says, “because there are so many of us together.”David is trying to see the positives. “Having more quality time with the children has been really good.”Zara Sehr Ashraf, 31, is a fashion programmer from Croydon, south London. She lives with her mother, Rubina, 59, her father, Arshad, 62, brother Faisal, 35, sister-in-law Huraira, 32, nieces Imaan, 4, and Noor, six months, and four cats, Babaganoush, Custard, Lana and BabbyLiving with her family in a three-bedroom terraced house is proving challenging for Zara Ashraf, particularly as she is still working. “It’s been laughable sometimes, honestly,” Zara says. “You’re on a Zoom call and there are lullabies playing, toys everywhere, kids in the background. I’ll be talking to my boss and out of the corner of my eye, I’ll see my niece ripping my favourite book to shreds.” Zara created a workstation in the living room, surrounding a makeshift desk with plants and purchasing an office chair, but her nieces knocked over the plants and drew all over the beige chair. “They’re only little,” she says. “What can you do?”In lieu of being able to escape her surroundings, headphones have become Zara’s best friend. But they don’t block out her dad’s friendly attempts at conversation. “He always wants to share a news story with me,” she says. “And he doesn’t really understand that I’m in a different headspace.” If her dad’s not nattering away, Zara’s mum is finding her something to do. “We’re not a hugely traditional family,” she says, “but we are south Asian, so there are gender roles there. I’ve not been furloughed, but I’m still being asked to help out in the kitchen with the cooking!”Maintaining focus at work has been difficult given the circumstances. “I feel grateful that I still have work,” she says, “but I’ve really noticed the psychological effects of not being able to go into the office every day and have the commute to decompress.”It’s not just work that is a challenge. “You’ll be lucky if you can steal a precious 20 minutes of sanctuary in the bathroom before the banging on the door begins,” Zara says. She proposed a bathroom rota to no avail. “It’s lawless in our household,” she laughs. “We don’t take well to rules.”Being trapped at home with her family has led to some conflict. “Things that wouldn’t normally bother us are definitely building up in an unhealthy way,” she says. “And because my parents are older, it’s more dangerous for them to go outside. So their pressures and frustrations are building up even more, because they have less release.”When everything gets too much, Zara retreats to her bedroom. “It’s my small paradise,” she says. Babaganoush sometimes joins her. “He’s my only ally in this house,” she jokes.Tess Giddings, 32, a homemaker and influencer from Bournemouth in Dorset, lives with her husband, Chris, an engineer, and their children, Jacob, 13, Savannah, 11, Amiah, 10, Zion, 8, Nevaeh, 4, and twins Levi and Hezekiah, 2“When this first started, I was like, ‘This is my worst nightmare’,” says Tess Giddings. “Having all the kids home from school? I can’t do this.” She is speaking to me from the family’s minivan because the house is too loud.Home schooling all seven children was her biggest worry. “The thought of it was overwhelming,” she says. Teachers advised Tess to take it day by day, and not put too much pressure on the kids, which helped her to feel more relaxed. Like many families, the Giddingses have been regulars at Joe Wicks’ morning PE sessions. “When there are so many kids to entertain, it is non-stop,” she says. “But every time I get stressed, I think that there are people in worse situations – people are dying. I have to be thankful we’re all healthy and together.”Chris, who has been furloughed, came up with an innovative solution to keep the younger children entertained: he has converted their garage into a soft play centre. “He’s padded it all out and childproofed it using his martial arts mats,” Tess says. “While he was doing it, I was rolling my eyes. But it’s been really good.”Buying enough food for her nine-person family exposes Tess to the ire of the British public. She was in Aldi doing a big shop when a man came up to her. “He said: ‘You better be having a party, because that takes the absolute mickey,’” Tess recalls. “He was smiling, but I could tell he meant it.”Online commenters can also be critical. After Tess posted a picture on Instagram of her family on a walk by the seafront, she received negative comments. “People were saying: ‘Stay in, you’re so selfish,’” she says. “But I know the government guidelines – we’ve done nothing wrong. Everyone is allowed one walk a day.”When it all gets too much, Tess hides in the van. “There is no escape in the house,” she sighs. “I even get followed to the toilet by the twins! Sometimes I go and sit in the van, for a bit of peace and quiet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b0cba2462139e0b75314ae12b73c81d3fbbacf/571_658_4307_2582/master/4307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31b948ccc6b58c68da321c75271d667c","title":"kaitlyn aurelia smiths lockdown listening doing handstands thats the time for music","story":"The LA ambient composer shares what she’s been listening to while upside down, from Caribou to Zimbabwean polyrhythmsI live in Los Angeles with my husband in a quiet neighbourhood that looks out on the Verdugo Hills. One of our best friends lives right behind us, so we have daily balcony conversations with them I’m very grateful for that.When I’m doing handstands, that’s the time for taking in other people’s music. I do a hand-balancing class almost every day, and I feel comfortable holding a handstand. Right now, my best is a minute and a half. It’s a symbol to me of the impossible, my own therapy practice about trying to break through mental constructs there are some things I feel confident in and some things where it feels as if there’s so far to go still. In the last two years, I went through a lot of health struggles and was burned out from touring. I struggled with depression, chemical imbalances, mental fog, ulcers – a whole slew of things. Through lots of different practices those all got healed, but any time I had depression, if I just got upside down it was like an instant fix.There’s an artist who goes under the name Green-House. I like all of their albums but I’ve been listening to one called Six Songs for Invisible Gardens. It’s not too upbeat and it feels like it provides steady movement to whatever you’re doing – it feels very light and uplifting.Mira O’Reilly’s Hockets for Two Voices is really beautiful. It’s just voice and it’s a study of hockets, which is like passing parts between voices. It has an energy that is really evocative – like it’s opening up a novel thinking space while I’m training.Another one is Danzindan​-​Pojidon by Inoyama Land. It has a very fantastical sound, so it helps me feel something magical is about to happen. I’m always looking for music that isn’t going to get stuck in my head, that’s just going to assist movement. Upbeat 44 rhythms are super challenging for me – not that I don’t appreciate them, but it just doesn’t work for my thinking pattern I’m looking for music that feels as if it’s moving you forward in a steady motion. I also listen to a lot of mbira music from Zimbabwe, which I find on a website called mbira.org – you can’t really find it on streaming sites. My brain really responds well to polyrhythms and the site is where I learn the most about complex polyrhythms and melody stacking.I love Caribou’s new album – though I don’t listen to that type of music on a daily basis, because things get stuck in my head really easily. I’m very connected to internal listening that’s how I write music. So if I have things that are stuck in my head then it can be really challenging – I have to do exercises to get it out.I’m teaching people how to create music. Sometimes people feel really blocked creatively and we work through that, or sometimes I do sessions where I guide people through their subconscious. I have remixes and commissions to work on, too, and I’m doing livestreams for fun. I’m also writing a book on somatic hearing, which is about the experience of receiving sound and the frequencies felt in the bones and in the muscular system. My husband and I started a label imprint called Touch the Plants and we have a book and tape combo coming that’s a collaboration between the poet Rob Moss Wilson and my husband, who goes under the name Cool Maritime. It’s like tiny pieces of wisdom, tiny poems over ambient soundscapes.I’ve also been watching Leaving Records’ livestreams on Saturdays, and I have a lot of friends who will go live on Instagram, spur of the moment. Each one feels so special and so helpful. I haven’t felt lonely during this lockdown.• Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith’s album The Mosaic of Transformation is released on 15 May on Ghostly International"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93f23ddf852a2397ebcfe697525e274c6b01735a/0_573_4635_2782/master/4635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f84cb6476dcdb798be9c1e16b93c7fe3","title":"spotify tip jar musicians pay fans donate artists","story":"Fans can now donate to their favourite artists via Spotify, but this feature is a tacit admission that the firm undervalues the musicians that make it viableWednesday’s announcement by the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, that social distancing in the UK could last for the rest of the year is terrible news for anyone bar lavishly wealthy introverts, but professional musicians will be among the most acutely worried.Decades of technological change have made musicians particularly reliant on live income. Once, you toured to promote album sales on CD, cassette or vinyl now, streams of your album make you a pittance unless you are extremely popular, and are mainly promotional tool for tours. With venues closed – along with clubs and shops, where your music might have been playing, accruing you a little more royalty cash – a large part of your revenue is gone.Spotify has acknowledged the new hardships facing musicians by adding a feature to the streaming service: a button that, if activated by the artist, allows users to directly donate to them via the digital wallet services Cash App and Paypal.me. Artists can also use the button to raise donations for coronavirus relief.There’s more unpacking to be done here than in a Tesco loading bay during the crisis. First, that charity option has added needless moral quandary. The general perception of your average musician – a hangover from the better-remunerated CD era – is that they’re sitting around in clothes bought by their label, idly jotting down a chorus after a searching conversation with their French bulldog. For them to ask for fans’ money rather than making a charity plea will easily make them seem craven and selfish.The reality is, as the US guitarist Chris Forsyth told me at the outset of the crisis: “A lot of fans don’t realise how low the margin for error is for a lot of musicians you see in the media . They are often making the same amount of money as a bartender.” Musicians need this money – but can their need be fairly compared with those of healthcare services? Spotify’s courting of charity donations should have been made in a different context from one where they’re trying to raise money for musicians. By combining them, it has undermined both types of giving.Raising money for musicians is what Spotify’s business model already does, in its begrudging and miserly way. The company generates income through subscriptions and from advertising fuelled by people wanting to listen to music. The income that is then partly funnelled back to the musicians as royalties. This royalty rate varies depending on location and whether the stream is paid or ad-supported, but is extremely low whichever way you cut it.Spotify’s method of generating the premium subscriptions that will turn it a profit was canny: draw people in with an excellent user experience and relatively light advertising in the free version during its early years, then ramp up the advertising to near-intolerable levels and wait for users to cave in to spending a tenner a month. Many casual music fans are now spending money more regularly on music than they did in the download or CD era. But the nature of the exchange has utterly changed: people are not paying for music but for a lack of advertising. The music is available either way.This is why the inclusion of the “tip jar” button is such a slap in the face for artists: it’s being initiated by the very service that helped to break the link between art and money. By paying royalties via both ad-funded and paid-for streams, Spotify has taken the onus off the consumer to pay the artist, and then, via low royalty payments, quietly eroded the monetary value in music that consumers and labels once propped up. The tip jar, while helping to replace lost touring earnings, is a tacit admission that artists are not being paid enough by the very service offering it – a similar admission was made by Amazon on Thursday in revealing that it paid £250,000 to a coronavirus hardship fund for authors.Looked at in isolation, the tip jar is a good thing. It reinstates that old financial link to a certain extent – a similar contract to the one made when you bought a CD, where your money was channelled towards one artist. Fan culture is one of the great intangible assets for a musician. It’s an engine that powers their popularity and indirectly funds their lifestyles through merchandise, concert tickets and more. With the introduction of direct-to-artist payments, that intangible becomes more tangible again, and artists can directly leverage their fans’ goodwill. Perhaps some will feel a moral queasiness at how naked this makes the transactional nature of art and commerce others might feel a kind of snobbery, that they’re no busker. The dramatic reality of the pandemic will likely steamroller such objections.Behind all this, we continue to stream music – it is one of the only ways we can hear it now. Spotify continues to generate profit from that streaming, as it stabilises after the huge expenditure of its development years. Royalty levels must increase in accordance with that ever-growing income Spotify must not cut itself out as the middleman and outsource compensation of artists purely to consumers via tips, given it has created a business thanks to both parties.For consumers, Spotify’s staggeringly vast and high-quality library remains one of the greatest things to have ever happened in music, but it is nothing without the artists who add to that library every day. Maybe subscriptions should cost more – the competitiveness between the streaming companies has forced down the value of music, and this now perhaps needs correcting. That would require a recalibration of how we value music, and it would need Spotify and its competitors to lead it. For now, donate to your favourite musicians, buy their T-shirts, cherish their artistry, and never let the company that built an empire from their labour off the hook."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32cff7f561e2bb1c46850ec4f4aa544c840176d8/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc9774fce6047623045330e6b536a22a","title":"veronique gens nuits review i guardini alpha","story":"GensI Giardini(Alpha)Gens’s nuanced, beguiling singing in this selection of 19th-century mélodies clarifies a sometimes unconvincing selection Véronique Gens’s recording of Chausson’s Poème de l’Amour et la Mer was one of last year’s outstanding releases, and a song by Chausson also forms the centrepiece of her latest recital disc of (mostly) 19th-century French mélodies – his Chanson Perpétuelle, in the scoring with piano quintet. Gens and the chamber ensemble I Giardini perform it here, alongside Guillaume Lekeu’s similarly scored Nocturne and other songs arranged for the same combination. In some cases that requires only minor adjustments – Fauré’s La Bonne Chanson (from which Gens sings just one number, alas) already exists in a version for voice, piano and string quintet, and little is lost by dropping the double bass part, but elsewhere original piano accompaniments have been rescored to include strings.Gens’s performances are as spellbinding as ever. It’s hard to think of another singer working today who is more compelling in this repertory, with every word crystal clear and every nuance of the text perfectly inflected. Yet it’s not so easy to reconcile oneself with the version here of L’Île Inconnue from Berlioz’s Les Nuits d’Été, where the thick string sound seems at odds with the buoyancy of the vocal lines, while the string parts added to Fauré’s Après un Rêve, floated so exquisitely by Gens, just seem unnecessary clutter. Saint-Saëns’s Désir de l’Orient works well enough, but then that is extracted from one of his operas (the one-act La Princesse Jaune) anyway, while it is good to hear one of Guy Ropartz’s Duparc-like Quatre Poèmes in any shape or form.I Giardini punctuate the sequence with three purely instrumental numbers. There’s the cello-and-piano version of Liszt’s La Lugubre Gondola, and a couple of rarities - a nocturne by Fernand de la Tombelle, and the scherzo from a piano quintet by Charles-Marie Widor. None of them quite justifies its inclusion here, but then the whole premise of the disc never quite convinces either, though Gens’s sublime artistry goes a very long way to counter that.Unlike Gens’s exclusively French collection, soprano Anna Prohaska’s recital for Alpha, Paradise Lost, takes in settings in four languages. It ranges far more widely chronologically, too, from Purcell to George Crumb – 25 songs by 21 composers arranged in a sequence tracing the Old Testament story of Adam and Eve. It’s a wonderfully enterprising selection, with a song from Messiaen’s Harawi next to Fauré and two numbers from Hanns Eisler’s Hollywood Songbook following one from Schumann’s Op 24 Liederkreis, but it is all just too bitty, even though Prohaska switches styles and epochs with maximum panache."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb9e77c4d61627062febe85cb15d6ddf013df8a/0_132_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e846f386dd3b1c165e5721803385ca8","title":"how the 5g conspiracy theories took hold","story":"’s media editor Jim Waterson looks at why conspiracy theories linking 5G technology to coronavirus have taken hold in the UK, with dozens of phone masts vandalised across the country over the past few weeks Last week a mobile phone mast serving the emergency NHS Nightingale hospital in Birmingham was one of the latest targeted by arsonists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of coronavirus.

They are also finding more people dead at home. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), delays to testing and stressful situations are taking their toll on these professionals’ physical and mental health.Here, four paramedics relate their working conditions as the Covid-19 pandemic rips through the UK.I’m attending at least four or five cardiac arrests a week, compared with one or two a week before the pandemic. That’s at least triple the number. My colleagues are experiencing this as well.We were expecting more autonomy to pronounce more people dead at home but that hasn’t happened yet. Our policies for when and how to resuscitate people haven’t changed since before the coronavirus outbreak began. It’s got to the point where, in some cases, we take people to hospital. When we get there, doctors are coming up to the back of the ambulance and pronouncing them dead there. They’re not attempting further resuscitation.On top of this, we don’t have enough PPE. We’ve been arguing for weeks that it’s not safe for us. Some paramedics are refusing to treat patients unless they have the appropriate PPE.We’re all approaching burnout. A lot of us have had holidays cancelled because of the lockdown. I’m absolutely exhausted and I need downtime at home to process it all.There’s a high call volume at the moment, and a lot of cardiac arrests. Most of them could be linked to Covid-19.One patient I went to who died was self-isolating along with his family. He was a high-risk patient because he had underlying health conditions and had a temperature and a cough. He hadn’t been tested but it sounded like it was Covid-19. That won’t go down as one of the recorded deaths because they hadn’t been tested.As a healthcare professional, I would recognise certain symptoms getting worse, treat them and take them to hospital. When people are at home and isolated, we’re getting to them too late.For someone with diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) it wouldn’t take much to tip them over the edge. It’s quite scary. There are lots more deaths out there that aren’t being counted.There is a lack of PPE. Some days you can go and get it, other days we’re having to beg for it. Sometimes you haven’t got it. If you’re two minutes away from someone who is arresting with no PPE, you can’t attend. Another ambulance has to be sent. We’re put in the position of do we leave it, or go in and put our families at risk?We shouldn’t have to make those decisions. It seems very inhumane.We are going to more people that we are pronouncing dead. We’d average one a week normally, but a week ago I was doing three or four a day. A few weeks ago, my small team saw nine people in a day die at home. Pre-coronavirus, that would never have happened.When a call comes in from the public we just get told someone’s not breathing. When we get there, we need to put PPE on. It’s stressful. These are the kinds of jobs where we want to – and the public expects us to – run in like superheroes, but we can’t.My impression is that people are getting a lot more unwell in a short period. We’re seeing a lot of people who have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Everything seemed all right and suddenly they got a lot worse. There’s no way of predicting that.Policy and procedure in ambulance services is changing all the time. At one point, we were told if we were going to a potential coronavirus patient, we’d have to fill out loads of contact tracing forms. Two days later, that got binned.In the early days of the outbreak, we didn’t have many masks and ambulances couldn’t be dispatched because they didn’t have one between them. We have enough now, but the plastic our aprons are made of is about the thickness of cling film and doesn’t cover our whole body.If we don’t think someone’s sick enough to go into hospital we leave them because if someone’s got a respiratory condition, like COPD, and they go into A\u0026ampE where they can potentially contract coronavirus, there’s another life gone.Usually I would see two cardiac arrests a week. Now it’s up to three. I don’t think coronavirus is going to hit us here as badly as places like London and Manchester because we are so spread out.I had one job last week where the person was dead on arrival. I don’t know whether it was coronavirus I don’t have a testing facility on me but you sort of presume that someone with respiratory problems had contracted it and that’s what killed them. When you go out to people who are dead on arrival and the partner is there you think, “Are they going to die now?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25d965283e87c322a5f9ce361dcb285daa4b524/0_0_5261_3159/master/5261.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c057ded5fe7febbc3fb31e2797a24c62","title":"government urged to increase child benefit to help poorer uk families","story":"Charities call for extra £10 a week per child to help those struggling during coronavirus lockdownThree major anti-poverty charities are calling on the government to increase child benefits amid growing evidence that the coronavirus shutdown is disproportionately affecting poorer families. Turn2us, Action for Children and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have all called for families to receive an extra £10 or £20 a week for each child after research found that more than 10 million children – in nearly 6m households – are facing financial crisis due to the pandemic.Citing ongoing problems, five-week waits to receive universal credit and delays to vouchers for free school meals, Action for Children has warned that many of the UK’s poorest families have little or no savings and have been left teetering on the brink.Carol Iddon, the deputy chief executive at Action for Children, said the charity’s frontline staff were “battling to help frightened families come out the other side of this but are overwhelmed by the sheer desperation of those who are only a pay cheque away from no longer being able to keep their children warm and well fed”.The charity has launched an emergency appeal. But, said Iddon, “the government must act, too, and use the most effective way we have of getting help to children, by increasing child benefit by £10 a week.”Tom Lawson, the chief executive of Turn2us, said the current crisis threatened to push more children into poverty. His organisation also has an appeal for help.“There are already 4.5 million children in the UK living in poverty. Ultimately, families need more support to see them through this crisis and we urge the government to intervene and increase child benefit payments, which have been subject to freezes since 2011.”He said that 2.2m households, including 2.5 million children, are currently unable to afford rent or mortgage payments.Iain Porter, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said an increase of at least £20 per child per week to the child element of universal credit and child tax credits would help families with children to weather the “worst of the storm”.“Without the urgent provision of a targeted lifeline for children, millions already trapped in poverty face deepening hardship, and many more risk being swept into poverty alongside them. We are therefore calling for a just emergency intervention, targeted to mitigate the immediate strain on low-income families,” he said.The Department for Work and Pensions said:”“We are doing whatever it takes to ensure people are supported through these unprecedented times, implementing an enormous package of measures, including increased universal credit payments, the coronavirus job retention scheme, statutory sick pay, mortgage holidays and greater protection for renters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac2b2c23433d28f023a1512d41fe668258491a1/0_150_12000_7200/master/12000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8086c6e62e69083cf3ddf3ab807ffa7","title":"therapy during coronavirus pandemic lockdown psychoanalysis freud","story":"In a pandemic, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic could never have come up with that. By  Gary GreenbergFor the 35 years I have practised as a psychotherapist, I have discouraged people from seeing themselves as hapless victims of forces arrayed against them. That’s the whole premise – that whatever brought you to my office, it is hampering your ability to direct the course of your own life. So let’s name your pain and then do something about it. Tell off the boss, walk out on the husband, confront the perpetrator, whatever it takes, and then move on, become the agent of your existence.It’s a profession that has been good to me, and I hope good for my patients. But what if the premise is undone by circumstance? What if it turns out that we are hapless victims of a force arrayed against us, that will mercilessly hijack the machinery of our lives, that is silent and invisible and leaves us with nothing to do but cower in our homes and wash our hands and hope that it will pass us by? Is there a role for therapy in a pandemic?Those are not the kind of questions I used to start my work day with, unless my first patient was someone with paranoid delusions. But then again, until a month or so ago, I didn’t start my working day by sitting down in front of my computer and clicking a patient into view. I’m already getting accustomed to it the human capacity for adapting is remarkable. But the one thing I can’t get used to, so far anyway, is the way my patients’ faces appear in this simulacrum of intimacy. I may have sat for hours with them, watched their faces contort in anguish, or beam in satisfaction. I may have searched out their eyes, tried to bring them back into contact from their safe haven on the ceiling. I may have thought I knew every inch of these faces, and no longer even needed to ask what their expressions meant.I wasn’t wrong, not exactly. I just didn’t realise that all that searching was done against so many tempting distractions: the catalpa trees outside my window, the paintings on my wall, the little corner of ceiling tile that was chipped 30 years ago and has never been repaired. I could swivel in my chair, adjust my posture, look at the clock, and then back to the face. Now that it has been reduced to a flat image in the middle of a flat screen, and I have no easy elsewhere to look, I’m realising that half the work was the struggle to behold those faces, and half the satisfaction was succeeding in wrestling attention to the task at hand. And maybe half the treatment was their observing that struggle, feeling the love in it.Of course, there’s more to the video than just the face, and distractions aplenty on the screen. But they are unfamiliar to me, and not in the world I share with my patient. Take this patient, just a guy trying to figure out his life now that his wife has left him. I might have known all about his sex life and his financial woes, but not that his couch was brown and his living room painted sky blue. It feels a little indecent to be seeing it. It’s one thing to penetrate the hidden meaning of his words – after all, that’s what he’s paying me for – and quite another to catch a glimpse of something I’m only seeing because that’s where the best wifi is. Can I ask him what it means that the shelves above the couch are empty? Would that question be a sign of love, or just impertinence?But still, that face. It’s right there. I can’t escape it, as I imagine he can’t escape mine. I keep looking at the postage-stamp version of what he is seeing. It’s vanity that draws my attention back to that corner of my screen, but it’s also curiosity. This hard and wrinkled face, this half-smile, these hooded eyes: this is what my patient sees? So much of my job is making sure I understand what I am conveying, labouring to launch my words across the room with the right inflection, the right expression, the one that carries my concern as well as my scepticism, that challenges and supports in equal measure, and watching myself watching myself, I can see that I haven’t got the slightest idea of how I am coming across – and I am far too interested in finding out. I click off the view of my own face.So we are focused on each other’s faces, but there is still at least one thing missing: that moment when your mutual darting attention comes to rest and you make real eye contact, not the off-kilter kind that comes from peering at a screen located a few inches from a camera, but an actual meeting of actual eyes transmitted through the air of a shared room. You look into each other, and you see, even if you don’t say it out loud (and you rarely do) just how rare and precious this is, this intimacy that you have kindled by agreeing (and again mostly without saying so) to be honest with each other, and to sit with the consequences. Which is the whole point, the reason they pay and I work, and the means, if there is one, of healing, if there is any.God, I miss that.If anything unites the disparate branches of psychotherapy, it is the belief that trauma twists the timber of the self, and determines the precise shape of our suffering. Freud identified this as the “repetition compulsion”, the unconscious tendency to place ourselves in situations that are versions of the past – or to construe them that way. Some traumas are more obvious than others, outright violation easier to identify than the diffuse ineptitude of some parents, or their inability to provide both love and sustenance on a sales assistant’s salary, or the manifold humiliations children suffer at the hands of other children. But as capable as we might be at burying them, our traumas are more capable of haunting us. Therapy is the work of exhuming them, bringing them to light, and then putting them behind us.This idea that the pain of the past shapes our present experience has never been scientifically proven, but it is very likely that this idea is part of how you understand your own history, whether or not you ever enter into therapy. And if you do come into my office, we will ferret out the trauma at the source of your discontent, and, having found it, if our work is successful, you will recognise it as the moment that turned your life, and as the moment that you must leave behind.But what if the trauma is not hidden in the mists of time, but right here, in the midst of life? What if it grows at every moment, in every encounter, at no one’s hand in particular but at everyone’s hands – especially if they were unwashed and touched the apple that you are right now hesitating over in the supermarket. Maybe that guy on the other side of the apple bin is smiling at you, understanding exactly what you are thinking, or maybe he’s glaring at you, trying urgently to dissuade you from putting the apple back into the pile. You can’t tell, of course, because, like you, he is wearing a mask. And the only thing worse are the people who are not – the people who, encouraged by a president with a Jack-o’-lantern smile, believe that the cure is worse than the disease and have brought their entire families to the grocery store to escape their lockdown. Complain to me right now, in the middle of this video therapy session, about that president or the masks or the guy who touched the apple and put it back, and am I really going to tell you that your outrage is about your father – even if, in some ineluctable way, it is?Or maybe you work in a hospital emergency department and you come home from your shift every day and take your clothes off in the garage and shower in the basement before joining your family upstairs, and you’re trying to snuggle with your kids, but all you can think of is the intubation you did, in full hazmat kit, and all those virulent droplets the patient expelled as you slipped the tube down his throat? Or you work in a nursing home and your ex-wife won’t let you see your children, even at a distance, until this whole thing is over, which is when, exactly? Or you are stuck at home in a marriage that depended for its success, you are just finding out, on your not being stuck at home together. Shall we go down memory lane in search of the trauma that has you ricocheting between boredom and terror? Shall we dissect your emotions so that you can see just how neurotic your response is?Freud promised his patients nothing more than the ability to trade in neurotic misery for common unhappiness. Still, he harboured some optimism, albeit a strange variety. He would surely have scoffed at Anne Frank’s assertion that in spite of everything, people are still good at heart, but he did believe we have a heart, and that it could be convinced to ache less, if only we could tell it the right story. That story would have to be realistic. It could not be the “nursemaid’s lullaby” of religion or the paranoid person’s account of a world out to get him. Its hero would be the stoic, who could accept the price he paid for the comforts of civilisation: the never-ending need to restrain his animal nature, and to never lose sight of the inescapability of nature’s red tooth and claw. It was a tall order, but Freud was convinced that we could accommodate ourselves to reality rather than pretending reality was other than what it is.Freud placed his bet on the human, as the source of both suffering and balm. He didn’t reckon with a nemesis so indifferent as a virus, any more than he worried about a meteor crashing into the Earth or the sun suddenly being snuffed out. The nice thing about depravity is that we can imagine ways to suppress it, and even succeed, if fitfully, at doing so. It’s not clear yet if we are ingenious enough to do that with this virus, and even if we are, that outcome is a long way off. In the meantime, we are stuck with the imperative to restrain ourselves to a degree that Freud did not anticipate. At a time when we need each other badly, when we are under attack not by human nature but by nature itself, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic never imagined that.Perhaps this is not the time to ask “What would Sigmund do?”. He’s not much of a role model in normal times, let alone times like these. It’s certainly not what I am asking right now, as I prepare for another day in front of the unblinking camera. What I am asking is the same thing that manufacturers turning their assembly lines to ventilator production or retailers improvising kerbside services are asking: how can I put my experience, my knowledge, my talents – suddenly rendered irrelevant and impotent – to use in a new and unfamiliar world?Some things are the same. People still complain about their wives and their kids and their bosses. They still have dreams, although it seems like a lot of them recently are about being trapped. They still well up with sadness or bite off their words in anger. They still look to me for support and guidance. They still laugh at my stupid jokes and tell me theirs. They still show up – although occasionally, if the appointment is in the evening, with a glass of wine. They still talk to me, answer my questions. They still pay me, if by online transfer.It’s reassuring, this continuity. It may help to explain one of the differences I’ve noticed: the ease with which people who are frequently evasive or argumentative or, as Freud would put it, resistant, seem to have suddenly shed their ambivalence. The man who could not talk about being molested now wants to, the woman whose abandonment by her husband left her too humiliated to speak of it now speaks of nothing else the couple who always showed up to the office five or 10 minutes late now sign into my virtual office five or 10 minutes early, and are perched eagerly on their sofa when I open my screen.Is it possible that the screen creates just enough distance to provide a safety that my words and gestures cannot? Have we inadvertently found a sweet spot between the detachment of everyday life and the cloud chamber of face-to-face therapy? Or are people so sick and tired of being cooped up with family, or alone, that they are spilling over with the desire to talk to someone else at any opportunity?I haven’t had time to interrogate this yet. I suppose if lockdown keeps up or gets more stringent, I will have to. Or maybe people will discover a new way to protect themselves from my intrusions, as the old forms of intimacy, the ones that require physical presence, recede into memory and the video version becomes the new normal. Perhaps Covid-19 has only accelerated a trend already under way.But the immediate question is not for the patients, but for me: what exactly am I supposed to do when I slip on the headphones and turn on the camera and another person in the midst of this crisis comes into view? The gambit of therapy is that the therapist is a few steps ahead of the patient, like a caving veteran leading a novice into a cavern unfamiliar to both he may not know the particulars, but his headlamp is a little brighter and he knows how to find his way around. But this cave is unfamiliar and my lamp is dim. I don’t even have a name yet for the strange admixture of emotion – fear and helplessness and disorientation and sadness and anger, in constantly shifting measure – that has taken hold in the last month or so, and that has become the new background of my life, too. I’m just as terrified as my patients are, maybe more so – and not just of drowning in Covid-19 or infecting my wife or losing my friends to disease. I’m as afraid of the aftermath as I am of the illness. Police are using helicopters to enforce social distancing. To those who defer to scientists and public health authorities, that may seem like a good idea. To those who crave power and who understand science well enough to know that this virus will be with us for a long time, it may seem like an opportunity.So I do not know what I am supposed to do when confronted with those worried, perplexed faces. I am making this up as I go along. I’m making more jokes than usual. I’m talking about my life more than I normally would, maybe because my patients hear my dogs barking or see the piano that sits in view of my camera as inexplicably as those empty shelves. And I am finding myself saying words I don’t remember saying, at least not so often: “Extraordinary times”, “unprecedented stress”, “uncharted waters”. To the man who can’t sleep, to the woman so racked by anxiety that she has begun to pull out her own hair, to the miserable college student whose postgraduate plans have evaporated along with the economy, to the parents of the high schooler who suddenly believes that the furniture in the house in which he is trapped is alive, and who, in less extraordinary times, probably would not have become psychotic, “I’m so sorry” is all I seem to have to offer.These are not the circumstances for which therapy is designed. The events that bring us into therapy generally have the decency to be limited in time and place. A global pandemic is global, and it may never fully recede, or it may be replaced by another, and either way, we will have learned what few people alive today know firsthand: that, despite our dams and cities, despite our weather forecasts, despite our medicines and ventilators, despite the vast knowledge and dedication of our scientists, the genius of our artists, and the scale of our achievements – despite everything we have built to keep ourselves safe, we are not. We can be undone – not only by one another, but by a strand of proteins, and not only in a moment, but with months of warning and over more months, perhaps years, of fear and illness. The horizons on which nuclear holocaust or global warming are gathering are just distant enough to remain abstract, and they are at least theoretically under human control. Not so with a virus.Therapists knew this long before Covid-19. Sit with people stunned by loss for any length of time and listen, really listen, to them, and it becomes clear that everyone will be confronted with grief and no one knows how it is supposed to go. So, if nothing else, we have got good at consolation. We know how to comfort, how to help people speak the unspeakable. Perhaps I will find use for other old tools, or the trauma of this pandemic will not prove as pervasive or persistent as it seems at this moment. But for the moment, this is what I have to offer those expectant, beautiful faces that are far away and so close: help in cataloguing the losses, and at grappling with them even as they mount. I can only hope it is sufficient.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b1ba202be762899f98376a02ae8c0ed23cd622c/0_93_4552_2732/master/4552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ae6c7ebe2bc9c7c985c09cbf38cccb","title":"my favourite game piers morgan v brett lee december 2013 cricket","story":"My respect for the hack blossomed after watching him face a ferocious over and live to tell the taleSay what you like about Piers Morgan, the man’s got balls.

Strictly the right stuff here, for a batsman on a hiding to nothing.Morgan is now the man who owns breakfast as Good Morning Britain co-host with Susanna Reid, the duo presenting must-see telly during the coronavirus pandemic. But until a December day in 2013 Morgan, for me, was just a hack with loud opinions. One over was all it took to change my mind, when one of those opinions – on this occasion slating England’s batsmen as they lurched towards an Ashes whitewash – landed him in an MCG net to face six blistering deliveries from Brett Lee, one of the most lethal bowlers in cricket history.This, then, is a love letter to PS Pughe-Morgan – right-hand bat, left-hand battered – who faced an over of terror and lived to tell the tale. In six deliveries he scored a “cracked wrist, bruised rib” and a “massive egg” on the back of his head. Indeed, the rib turned out to be broken. Sledging the England team has its drawbacks after all.So where does this over rank among cricket’s best? Andrew Flintoff to Ricky Ponting at Edgbaston in 2005? Meh.

Morgan v Lee tops the lot.Let’s head back to that glorious post-Christmas day and relive every bruise …Ball 1 Morgan shapes up with a swing and jibe. Asked if he regrets his decision to face Lee, he says: “No, but I tell you what, I’m about to ruin a great Australian career and legend.” Lee steams in like a dog with three tails and, seeing Morgan backing away (let’s say strategically), follows him to leg … wide leg. Strike one. “Didn’t feel a thing.” And batsman points bowler back to his mark. Class.Ball 2 Veering towards leg again (expertly … let’s be kind), Morgan is felled by a bouncer that would have cleared a stadium car park roof. “Fucking bring it on mate, bring it on … try pitching one in my half.”Ball 3 Struck once more, Morgan is offered the services of the Australian team doctor. The batsman is dented but unbowed: “No. Bring it on.”Ball 4 Building a hit parade for the ages, Morgan receives encouragement from Mark Nicholas: “Well, you’re unbeaten Piers.” Swings, roundabouts, etc.Ball 6 Not pretty, but still standing. Win.Cheers and applause rang out after the barrage and, asked if he was surprised at what he had just encountered, Morgan said of Lee: “Well, he’s a bit quicker than I thought he’d be for his age, to be honest.”The Australian then summed up the scale of courage on show: “Considering he hasn’t played a top level of cricket, but he does have a great cricketing brain, you have to take your hat off to him … I wouldn’t have got in there and faced that.’’Of course there have been naysayers, chief among them Sir Richard Hadlee, who said it was “dangerous and unnecessary”. But they’re wrong. This is one of the greatest moments in cricket. Oh and all right then, good for a lockdown giggle.So hats, caps, helmets and bandages off to Piers Morgan: a hero for our times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5c347220aa4877529a29395017def2fa0f68cc/0_0_1349_2111/master/1349.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a762642a92a4689ee1b2a0994c135a79","title":"the book novel that inspired me to travel readers tips","story":"Words on a page can bring the world to life. Readers select the travel books and novels that made them go out and discover it by sparking their imaginationsI read Jupiter’s Travels while living in Cambodia. Ted Simon’s tales of his motorcycle adventure around the world is so thrilling and adventurous that I immediately went out and bought an old Honda. I dreamed of following in his tyre tracks and travelling around the world, being welcomed as a hero everywhere I’d go. I didn’t get very far – the Vietnamese authorities wouldn’t allow the bike over the border – but a motorcycle world tour is still the top of my bucket list, and Jupiter’s Travels taught me to embrace the journey, not just the destination.Chris PicklesIt’s not strictly a travel book, but the novel that inspired me to pursue my dream of traveling in China was Soul Mountain. It is loosely based on Gao Xingjian’s own experience of escaping mainland China after being labelled a counter-revolutionary during the Cultural Revolution. The writing style has a dream-like spiritual quality that carries you effortlessly along the journey. It is split into two voices – You and I – which makes it unique among any book I’ve ever read as it directly addresses the reader. Madison PlantierMayle makes Provence – though seen through a fantasy gauze – seem hypnotic, and the food, drink and lifestyle of the local country folk are charming beyond compare. He describes the region one month at a time (hence A Year in Provence) and you live his dealings with local tradepeople, the postman and neighbours. The walks through markets leave you drooling for some chèvre and a crust of bread. The restaurants and stories about the clientele are delightful. In his second book, Toujours Provence, he said people were contacting him from all over the world – a woman in Indiana asked “How are the schools?” The fantasy of living there has driven many of us to visit.Kirby LindsayHemingway’s autobiographical book about living in a cold flat on the Left Bank of Paris with his wife and child in the 1920s, while making the transition from journalist to novelist, made the biggest travel impact on me. It took me 15 years to make it to Paris after reading the book, but I retraced the paths he walked –down the side streets that laced together his hangouts, from the Shakespeare \u0026amp Company bookshop next to the River Seine, to walking to his mentor Gertrude Stein’s residence at 27 rue de Fleurus, while avoiding the smells that might trigger his hunger when he was low on money. The book still works as tour guide, as much of that version of Paris still exists.Mike HainsworthPamuk’s novel is about a lovelorn fellow who collects (and sometimes steals) hundreds of little mementos of his girlfriend. Along the way we are treated to wonderful insights into life in Istanbul in the 1970s. And there is a real museum to match! Hidden in a little alley near the port is a tall, narrow building displaying all the book’s mementos. Even if you haven’t read the book, it’s fascinating. If you have, it’s like stepping into the story. Caroline MorganI read For a Pagan Song and fell in love again. In this sad, beautiful story of self-recovery, the writer found his piece of paradise with the Kalash people in the Hindu Kush in north-west Pakistan, having followed in the footsteps of Peachey and Daniel from Rudyard Kipling’s The Man Who Would be King. The Kalash are the last people in the Hindu Kush who continue to practise their ancient pagan religion in the valleys of Bumburet, Birir and Rumbur. They look almost European, possibly descended from Alexander the Great. I wanted to meet them. Having travelled through beautiful Pakistan in 1995 I returned in 2015 and, travelling through some adventurous terrain and situations, also found that piece of paradise. Thank you, Jonny.Helen RitchieI first read Along the Inca Road back in 2000 when I was 14. It told me about a world I had never previously imagined and awakened a lifelong love of travelling and fascination with Latin America. In the intervening years I have been fortunate enough to travel to South America several times and see the incredible landscapes and places described in the book, inspiring the same sense of awe I felt as a 14-year-old in suburban England, dreaming of what lay beyond. I reread the book every few years, and it is currently helping to satisfy my wanderlust during the lockdown.NatalieThe novel that inspired me to go to India was Shantaram. Gregory David Roberts imbues the narrative with a real sense of place. It is a novel about Bombay (now Mumbai) as much as it is about the storyline and colourful characters he creates. Lin, the narrator, arrives in Bombay on the run using a false passport and makes friends with Prabaker, a local. Together they enter the hidden world of the city’s slums and mingle with down-and-outs and reprobates. Lin and his friends meet at the Leopold Cafe – and I just had to visit the cafe when I eventually got to Mumbai! This is a perfect book for armchair travel and certainly inspired me to visit the city.Tina HartasI was 12 when I started reading this novel, the story of a medieval doctor and philosopher in plague-ridden Bruges. The description of churches, old buildings and yards lead to mysterious and beautiful canals made me want to know everything about the city. Being from far away Brazil, it struck me as somewhere almost heavenly, and I fed on this dream until I was able to travel to Europe for the first time. And Bruges is still the most beautiful city in the world for me, a journey back in time, and this book still my favourite story.Maria Rosa Nascimento SilvaIn 1986 I was in traction for six weeks with a broken pelvis. A friend lent me Hawkfall, a book of local fables by the Orcadian writer George Mackay Brown, and I was captivated. My ensuing trip involved the Far North Line rural railway to Thurso and then a ferry across to Orkney narrow streets of Stromness, Skara Brae, Maeshowe and Brough of Birsay the Earl’s Palace in Kirkwall bonxies (great skuas), short-eared owls and red-throated ers and the sing-song accent of the locals, who were so welcoming. It was even better than I’d hoped for. Thirty years on and with early retirement on the horizon, a return trip is being planned and Hawkfall reread.DonI read The Peacock Spring when I was 14. I was completely captivated by the story of an English teenage girl in colonial India who fell in love with the gardening boy. The yearning for India never left me. I reread the book in 2016 at the age of 53, and then finally travelled to south India. It was every bit as magical as I had imagined.Sarah WheelerLee’s traverse of Spain in the shadow of the civil war remains the ultimate paean to travel itself, and the best portrait of this most varied and misunderstood country. At once sparse (“I had a few shillings in my pocket and no return ticket”) and poetic (“the city moved somnambulantly before me like a series of engravings seen through watery glass”), the prose contrasts the simplicity of the quest with the richness of the experience. This heady promise of exploration and delight prompted my own trip, as I too threw off the shackles of my West Country youth. It finished in Andalucía and, like Lee, l knew I would return.Andy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4bd86106c1500265a589e47e3d3dd776feb5ac/0_302_5000_2998/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bc192358531018ce630aee54649864e","title":"the secrets to stargazing from your backyard","story":"How to search the sky and what to see, from moon and stars to planets and the International Space Station. Go on a journey of billions of miles … from your gardenTo begin looking for objects in the heavens, you’ll need to know where north, south, east and west are. Make a note of where the sun rises (east) and sets (west), use Google maps or use the compass on your phone. Now, download a free astronomy app to your phone AND computer. My favourite, for ease of use and features, is Stellarium .Once the app is installed, set your location. This ensures that, when opened, the app indicates what is in the sky above you – wherever you live in the world. Stellarium automatically sets the time and date but also has a function that speeds up time, so you can fast forward to night-time and explore the sky from your sofa. It’s even possible to set it to show the sky on the night you were born.Decide what you want to search for in the sky (such as star clusters, constellations, planets) and use Stellarium to find them virtually: this will tell you which direction they lie in, and how high up in the sky to look. Sky Map (Android) and Star Walk (iPhone) are free stargazing apps and provide the names of stars, constellations and planets if you point your phone at the sky. Both have a “night view” or “red light” option, which is useful once your eyes adjust to the dark.Stargazing from home doesn’t always mean apps and laptops: you can see plenty with binoculars – even a cheap pair. Sir Patrick Moore recommended 10x50 binoculars for astronomy as a good starting point and I’ve been using a pair of these at Battlesteads Observatory for five years.Ensure your eyes are “dark adapted” by turning off lights. Your eyes will start adapting immediately and that will improve over the next 30 minutes. If stargazing from inside through a window, ensure the area is free from clutter, turn off your lights and get comfortable. If in a yard or garden, turn off all the lights on that side of your house and turn off any outside lights too, being careful to make sure there are no trip hazards first. Whether you live in the light-polluted city or are blessed with dark skies you’re ready.The phase of the moon changes daily. The phase is how much of the moon is visible from Earth – full, half and crescent, for example. The line between the light and dark side of the moon is called the terminator. Each night, look closely at the terminator and you’ll see different craters, valleys and mountain ranges as the line slowly moves across the surface.In the evening, Venus is a bright dot in the west. It shines brightly because the thick clouds that shroud it are reflecting sunlight towards us. If you’ve got binoculars to hand, or a small telescope, notice that Venus isn’t a perfect circle either – it has phases just like the moon.In the east on pre-dawn mornings throughout April and May, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars line up as three incredibly bright colourful dots. They’re all visible with the naked eye, though with binoculars Mars will look salmon pink, Saturn oval-shaped (because of the rings) and you may even see some of Jupiter’s moons.On 4 July after 9.30pm, the Moon, Jupiter and Saturn will all be very close together in the sky, forming a conjunction, which is a rare event.Constellations are official patterns of stars, and you’ll be familiar with some names and patterns. During April, Orion will be visible in the west after sunset. Recognisable by the three stars in a row that form his belt, this is one of my favourites because hanging from his belt is a “sword” containing another three stars and the middle “star” is a naked-eye visible nebula where baby stars are being born. Look at this with binoculars and you may spot a blurry smudge that some see as coloured turquoise.Look north for the Plough (often called the Big Dipper). The second star on the “handle” of the Plough is a naked-eye double star. Look closely or use binoculars and you’ll be able to see them clearly even with high light pollution.Orbiting the Earth, 250 miles up, is the International Space Station (ISS), home to (usually) six astronauts from around the world. You can easily spot it with the naked eye as it flies from west to east. Go to spotthestation.nasa.gov and enter your location to see when it’s due to fly over you.Astronomers hate clouds, but from May to July an eerie phenomenon, often mistaken for the aurora borealis, graces our skies. Noctilucent clouds are whiteelectric blue ice crystal clouds that form only in the summer, 50 miles up at the very edge of space. Sometimes seen about an hour after sunset, or an hour before sunrise, looking north, they are hauntingly beautiful and best observed with the naked eye.Even when it’s cloudy you can explore the universe.

Hoarding bottled water simply isn’t necessary for most people.What’s more, most bottled water sold in the US comes from the same municipal sources that supply tap water – a fact probably unknown to most consumers. Coca-Cola makes Dasani at the company’s Detroit plant by purchasing, treating and bottling municipal water before selling it at a significant mark-up to consumers. Pepsi bottles its Aquafina water brand in Detroit the same way.The business model is hugely profitable. The cost to buy that municipal water is exceedingly low – and once bottled, the mark-up can be about 133 times greater, a Consumer Reports analysis of company water billing and usage records found.But what’s good for businesses isn’t necessarily good for consumers, according to CR’s review, which included the examination of hundreds of pages of billing and other records obtained through public records requests, and interviews with environmental law experts, industry consultants, residents of Detroit and consumer advocates.For starters, bottlers and consumers aren’t always treated as equals by water utilities, CR found. In Detroit, whose policy before the coronavirus crisis called for shutting off water to residents if they fall $150 behind in their water bills, 2,800 homes were estimated to be without running water at the start of the pandemic.But bottlers in Detroit have also racked up tens of thousands of dollars of past due water bills that went unpaid for months, CR found. Not once has their access to water been shut off over the period we examined. When asked why, the city cited the companies’ strong payment history and an ability to pay their bills.From a regulatory point of view, companies that want to put vast quantities of public water into bottles for profit face few hurdles and minimal ancillary costs, leading some experts to call for taxes on the bottlers. And because the water supply, including the processing and infrastructure, that bottlers rely on is paid for by local taxpayers, the companies’ business is subsidized by the public, consumer advocates say.Detroit has been questioned about the potential health risk of water shutoffs before. In August 2014, residents who had their taps turned off argued in court to suspend shutoffs because a lack of water could create unsanitary conditions and lead to the transmission of hepatitis A, influenza and other diseases.Detroit’s lawyers argued that those residents could rely on alternative sources – like bottled water. “Just because a person is out of water doesn’t mean they can’t get water,” a city lawyer said at a court hearing.The judge in the case ultimately sided with the city, and the shutoff campaign carried on.Now, six years later, Detroit and other cities have taken some steps to address residential water shutoffs during the coronavirus crisis – people need running water not just to cook and bathe, but to practice basic virus-fighting hygiene.But the reprieve is only temporary. And it hasn’t necessarily reached everyone.A Detroit spokesperson said all customers who called to enroll in a program that would turn their water back on during the pandemic had either been restored or were in the process of a restoration. But the spokesperson conceded that some occupants may not have called, and advocates dispute the city’s reported progress.“We believe the city of Detroit is vastly exaggerating their progress and underreporting the number of people without water,” said Shea Howell, a member of the Detroit-based advocacy group the People’s Water Board Coalition, during a recent teleconference with reporters.“It’s just unconscionable to make people fear losing their water service at this time,” said Mary Grant, director of the Public Water for All Campaign at Food \u0026amp Water Watch. “We need every governor to step up to address this crisis immediately.”People whose water gets shut off because they can’t afford their bill may have no choice but to buy bottled water that comes from the same source that feeds their tap. They may be obtaining bottled water from companies that have been behind on their water bills but didn’t face a shutoff, and whose business depends on access to publicly funded water systems.And it’s not just in Detroit: Coca-Cola and Pepsi get water from other major cities, including Phoenix and Denver, with a history of shutting off water to residents before the coronavirus crisis.Coca-Cola didn’t respond to questions from CR about water shutoffs or its late payments, but the company says it obtains water from a variety of sources, including municipal supplies, and uses a treatment process that “creates a consistent pure, clean, and crisp taste”. The company said it remains in operation as the federal government identified the food and beverage industry as “critical” to keeping grocery stores stocked.Two decades ago, most bottled water in the US came from natural springs, sold by brands like Evian and Nestlé’s Poland Spring.Pepsi did not respond to repeated requests for comment from CR.Beulah Walker, chief coordinator for the local not-for-profit group Hydrate Detroit, which assists local residents without running water, pointed out the irony of the situation for residents who have lost their water service at home and may turn to bottled water – possibly Aquafina or Dasani made with city tap water – as an alternative.“Detroit residents are paying twice when they buy bottled water,” Walker says.In 2014, Detroit’s shutoff policy drew national attention, when the city, which emerged that year from bankruptcy, launched a campaign to disconnect service to residents in arrears – forcing them to turn to other sources such as capturing rainwater or buying bottled water. Shutoffs have continued since then, but officials concluded in early March that a reprieve was needed to help residents during the coronavirus outbreak.Ricky Reynolds is one of the beneficiaries. The 65-year-old Detroit resident moved into his home down the road from Coca-Cola’s bottling plant last summer, after obtaining the deed from an acquaintance for $500. It should have been a happy occasion. Reynolds had been homeless, bouncing between family and friends, so it was a relief to get his own place – until he tried to get the water bill put in his name.Reynolds, who is retired, learned from the city that his new home had a nearly $20,000 unpaid water bill.In the months before the city finally restored his water service during the pandemic, Reynolds says, he had to fill up containers with water from family members, then haul them home. And he bought bottled water whenever he could – including, he said, Dasani, which may have been made around the corner at the Coca-Cola plant. (The city didn’t directly respond to questions about Reynolds’ case.)Detroit’s temporarily suspended shutoff policy states that residents or businesses are delinquent and potentially risk having their water shut off if they are 60 days past due with a minimum balance of $150, a spokesperson said. (The city considers a company’s accounting practices, as well, before determining whether to proceed with a service interruption.)Records show that, since 2017, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola met that threshold at points.Between April and July 2017, billing records show, Coca-Cola had a $77,600 balance that went unpaid for three months. From August to November of that year, it carried a balance of as much as $287,250, before finally paying it off. That December to March of 2018, the company had a balance that fluctuated between $1,860 to $108,170, before paying it off in full. Meanwhile, from December 2018 to February 2019, Pepsi had a balance between $1,410 and $29,710, until paying it off.The city never shut off the company’s water, and bottling continued.“Since both Pepsi and Coca-Cola have a strong payment history and an unmatched ability to pay their bills, DWSD does not pursue service interruptions,” said Bryan Peckinpaugh, spokesman for Detroit’s water and sewage department.“These companies never go longer than three months past due, at which time the balances due, including late fees, are paid. These companies are not a priority target for service interruption due to their payment history and ability to pay.”Coca-Cola and Pepsi did not respond to CR’s questions about why they went months without paying their bills.Grant, of Food \u0026amp Water Watch, takes exception to the city’s position. “You should have a policy and should apply it equitably,” she said. “I think this is discrimination against low-income households in Detroit, that you’re having a shutoff policy and you’re not applying it, the same shutoff policy, to these big corporations because you expect them to pay down the road.”Reynolds was also stunned to hear that Detroit let Coke and Pepsi’s bills slide.“That’s not fair,” he said. “They’re picking on the little guy.”This story is co-published in partnership with Consumer Reports, which has a full version of the story here.

But the sale is only the latest development in a turbulent 18 months for Movianto, which has included legal disputes with a property developer who built the enormous warehouse in Merseyside.The disputes culminated in Movianto securing a high court injunction in March last year, to thwart threats by the developer, Oliver Morley, to “lock the gates” and prevent Movianto employees from accessing the warehoused stock.Morley’s company has since gone into administration and its legal claims against Movianto have been discontinued, but Morley maintains his legal battles with Movianto were not over. He called for an investigation into the firm, alleging there was “a much bigger story that needs to be told” about his former tenant, but declined to provide specific details.For its part, Movianto firmly dismisses all of Morley’s allegations, pointing out that his property firm was defeated last year in court. The company insists the legal disputes and the sale have had no impact on its storage or distribution of PPE in recent months.“Movianto firmly believes that it has and continues to perform to all contractual obligations,” the firm said.But the saga is likely to put a spotlight on the UK government’s decision to outsource the management of the emergency stockpile. In three years, the stockpile appears to have been stored in three different warehouses. Meanwhile, management of the stock has been passed from a German–owned multinational to an American one.In the coming months the custody of the UK’s emergency stockpile of PPE will be passed on to a family-run business based in suburban Paris.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “The pandemic influenza stockpile held under this contract has remained safely and securely stored at all times and has supported our Covid-19 response through the distribution of vital personal protective equipment and essential supplies to the NHS and social care sector.”Widespread shortages of PPE have dominated complaints over the government’s handling of the pandemic in recent weeks, including from NHS workers who say their lives are being endangered by the lack of adequate protection. This week an RAF plane was dispatched to Turkey to secure more supplies.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, insists the government is rising to the challenge, and has repeatedly said the PPE challenge has been “one of distribution rather than one of supply”. In addition to procuring new supplies from China, the DHSC has been drawing on the emergency stockpile, which it has stored since 2006 under its pandemic influenza preparedness programme.That stockpile is made up of around 52,000 pallets of equipment worth an estimated £500m. While it contains antiviral medicines and flu vaccines which are of limited use against Covid-19, the bulk of stocks are said to be PPE and hygiene products. Much of the stock needs to be frequently monitored, updated and stored in temperature–controlled conditions.The government owns the stock, but outsources its management to private firms. Previously, the contract was held by DHL. Movianto, a subsidiary of the US health company Owens \u0026amp Minor, won the £55m deal in the summer of 2018.As part of Movianto’s plans, the company entered into business with Morley to build the vast warehouse in Merseyside. In the meantime, the pandemic stockpile was to be temporarily housed in another warehouse, also owned by Morley, in Knowsley.Movianto’s plans were approved by the Cabinet Office, documents suggest. The company says its decision to enter into business with Morley was “made by executives no longer associated with Movianto”.A notice for the new NHS contract stipulated that the contractor would be required to maintain “a ready state for deployment in the event of a pandemic event”.In early 2019, Movianto became mired in disputes with Morley’s company, which accused the firm of not paying rent for the warehouse in Knowsley. According to Morley, his tenants became “uncooperative”. “This went on for weeks,” he said. Movianto strongly rejects the allegation, saying it paid rent “in accordance with the terms of the lease”.Another grievance related to the payment of electricity bills to power the generators to ensure the stock, including medicines, was stored at the right temperature. Morley claims he ended up having to pay for electricity to power the generators, which “kept going on the blink” resulting, he alleges, in “temperature spikes”.A Movianto source said Morley’s account was inaccurate. In a statement, Movianto said electricity generators were only needed because of “Morley’s own failure to provide a mains supply in accordance with his contractual obligations”.By his own account, Morley’s financial disputes with Movianto culminated in him threatening the firm. “It got to the point where I said I’m just going to lock the gates and refuse you entry to the site.” When that happened, Movianto rushed to the high court in March 2019 and successfully obtained an injunction to ensure continued access to the warehouse.Movianto said the injunction was required as “a result of Morley’s conduct and repeated threats to interfere with Movianto’s operations”. It said Morley’s allegations over rent and generators were undermined by “various court proceedings” that ruled in Movianto’s favour. In July 2019, under the control of administrators, Morley’s property company Industrial North West LLP discontinued its legal claims against Movianto.Morley insists he will continue to seek legal action against Movianto – and he is used to high-profile disputes. In January, he lost a prominent lawsuit against RBS in which he claimed the bank’s controversial restructuring group placed him under duress by seizing his assets after struggling to repay a £75m loan. A high court judge noted Morley used the “borrowed personal wealth” to spend on “South African mining investments, property, cars, a yacht and a jet”.Morley told the  his lifestyle was the result of hard work and “had nothing to do with being a good landlord”. He insists previous business disputes are irrelevant to his grievances against Movianto, which came to a head in May 2019.As works were completed at the Merseyside warehouse and Movianto prepared to transfer the stockpile from Knowsley, Industrial North West was forced into administration. Documents state the firm “failed to comply” with the conditions of a £61m loan facility.Morley lost control of his warehouses and administrators stepped in. According to the administrator’s report, the legal dispute “caused delays to the construction works” at the new warehouse, which were finally completed in July 2019. Movianto said the legal disputes “have had no impact on Movianto’s work in response to Covid-19”.According to a government source, the transfer of the UK’s emergency PPE supplies to the new warehouse was completed by the end of August 2019, four months before the first cases of Covid-19 emerged in China.The warehouse is now owned by Warrington council, which bought the property for £45m in October. During a change of shifts on Tuesday afternoon, warehouse workers were seen having their car boots searched as they left.In the coming months, their employer will switch from Owens \u0026amp Minor to the French company EHDH Holding Group, under a deal agreed on 6 April. The sale is expected to be completed before the end of June, with demand for supplies in the UK’s pandemic stockpile expected to continue for many months.The distribution of that stockpile’s PPE, it seems, may no longer solely be the responsibility of Movianto. Eleven days ago, the DHSC announced a new “247 military operation” to oversee the supply of PPE to health and care workers. “We’ve had to create a whole new logistics network, essentially from scratch,” Hancock said.A government source said the coronavirus outbreak presented different requirements to a flu pandemic – the basis of Movianto’s original contract. Movianto was now “supporting” the government’s PPE plan through its contractual obligations, the source said. Movianto said the terms of its NHS contracts were “confidential”.Jeff Jochims, the chief operating officer of Owens \u0026amp Minor, said: “We look forward to closing the sale of Movianto business to EHDH, but in the meantime will continue our ceaseless work to support the global response to this pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4d63b5f5370b31b954d037f434ace41df8b2b57/0_2_5245_3147/master/5245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb6b2ffdefb908610f25349f77c90ed","title":"why are people from bame groups dying disproportionately of covid 19","story":"Co-morbidities, demographics and societal imbalances all play a part, says UCL professor Nishi ChaturvediCo-morbidities could certainly play a role. The black population, where the discrepancy appears to be greatest, is particularly afflicted with hypertension. Diabetes is three-fold higher in this ethnic group. Both of those conditions will increase your risk of death once you’ve got Covid. The added problem is that these conditions occur at a younger age in people of black descent. However, in mitigation against that, certainly older people of black African descent don’t smoke as much, so have less respiratory disease, have lower rates of cancers and coronary disease. With Asian populations, the story is a bit different, but again there is a four-fold excess in diabetes and blood pressure rises higher with age in South Asians compared to Europeans.Genetics sounds like an easy get-out clause, but it isn’t. Ethnicity is a complex socio-cultural construct, it’s not a biology construct. There’s no gene for being Asian. There’s no gene for being black. People of ethnic group membership can change over time and with age, it’s not an immutable thing and it very poorly maps on to any biology you can think of. People have looked to see if there’s a genetic explanation for these ethnic differences in chronic disease and have been unable to find one, despite having looked quite hard in large numbers. So there’s no evidence that genes explain the excess risk of Covid susceptibility. It’s important to put a nail in that one because it feels as if we can abdicate any responsibility for sorting this out and this really isn’t the case.Ethnic minorities are over-represented in high-risk occupations, including health workers, in the transport sector and essential shop work. Clearly, there’s a huge amount of heterogeneity, but overall ethnic minorities are more likely to live in deprived, dense, over-crowded urban areas and are more likely to be disadvantaged. In some cases, household composition could play a role, particularly in Asian households where you have multi-generational households living together.So both through occupation and residential reasons, they’re less able to socially isolate effectively and much more likely to be exposed to high doses of the virus. There’s some suggestion that the greater the dose you’re exposed to the more likely the disease is to prove fatal. That’s perhaps one reason why even quite young healthcare workers are succumbing to the disease.The evidence on ethnic differences in healthcare seeking behaviour is quite messy, and we need to remember that these are quite heterogeneous groups. For instance, people of black ancestry have been found to be less likely to consult for chronic diseases like diabetes, but that doesn’t mean to say that if it’s an acute condition they won’t come forward. One study of people accessing antiviral flu treatments in the flu pandemic of 2009 found that ethnic minorities were less likely to ask and less likely to collect these. But whether this was due to reluctance, differences in access to healthcare, the way the message was put across or racism – it is difficult to pick apart because the healthcare seeking process is so complicated.Ultimately, this is about health inequalities, about deprivation and affluence and how important socio-economic status is in determining health outcomes. This isn’t just an ethnicity story, it affects all of us. Britain has a long history of health inequalities. It’s critically important to understand and I’m relieved that the government is taking this seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09b8808e86751d86d7a3d39a8738777bd3a1f39f/0_57_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8f261dd5ab6c3a19481db80d228fba5","title":"coronavirus delivers a moment of truth on the meaning of the eu","story":"The issue of recovery funds shapes up as an acid test of commitment to the unionThe EU’s anxious debate over the bloc’s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic is at heart about the nature and competing visions of the union.It is a perennial question found lurking in the background of all EU negotiations over long-term budgets, not least the most recent inconclusive and toxic talks in which north was pitted against south.But it comes now at a time of dangerously raw emotional upheaval when popular opinions on the worth of institutions are peculiarly malleable.The question being posed by events is whether there is enough of a sense of kinship among EU citizens for national governments to back the most radical of the burden-sharing plans proposed to rebuild the eurozone economy as one. And if not, can the Italians, in particular, be convinced of the added value of the union?For all the inevitable prevarication, ill-concealed by a smokescreen of Eurojargon and acronyms, we are approaching what Emmanuel Macron has described as a moment of truth.The European economy is in a slow-motion car crash with the coronavirus. Initial impact has been made. The full scale of the damage will not be clear for months to come.There will be a vast number of deaths. There will also be a savage economic recession. Analysts predict a near doubling of unemployment in the EU, with whole swathes of industry collapsing.The depth of the crash and its repercussions in the political sphere will be decided to a significant degree by the nature and range of spending in the immediate months and years. That will involve huge debt, and with that comes the question of where liability for it lies and who controls how the money is spent.If governments try to come out of this crisis through national borrowing alone, it is possible, even probable, that the debt accrued by the least productive economies will come to be seen as unsustainable by the markets. Economies could slide into despair, risking further joblessness, hunger, destitution.Some countries might seek to restrict their borrowing for fear of such an outcome, but they risk their economies shrivelling in relation to their EU neighbours.In either scenario, the EU would be in a dangerous predicament in which cries of betrayal would be strongly heard as some stride out of the pit of the crisis for which all European countries are equally blameless.The Italian answer to this has been the so-called coronabonds under which eurozone countries would, from now, commonly raise debt on the markets and be jointly liable.That concept goes some way to presuming there is an EU community of people in support of a transfer union, where the richest help pay the way for the poorest and the countries more strongly positioned in this crisis sacrifice for the weakest.“Europe has to come up with an answer,” the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, demanded.The Netherlands, Austria, Finland and Germany are opposed to the concept of coronabonds. They raise the issue of moral hazard in that such a policy would seemingly punish those countries that had saved for a rainy day, and say it could risk further fiscal irresponsibility.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has raised the issue of democratic accountability by suggesting there is not sufficient political union among the 27 for such shared debt. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, well aware that the forces in support of “Nexit” – led by characters such as the Eurosceptic politician Thierry Baudet – could make mischief, has said such bonds would be in breach of the EU treaties.There are ways out of this dilemma, as there have been in the past. Should Italy stop presenting agreement on coronabonds as a test of solidarity, the commission has suggested a €300bn recovery fund in the 2021-27 budget. The commission would also borrow €320bn from the capital markets for targeted spending.Perhaps Italian and Spanish voters will regard this as satisfactory. Their leaders have, however, set a high bar for the EU, which it is not at all clear it is able to meet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=377b7e9952a8b143333fc91bc5ca5998","title":"greenland cautiously welcomes reports us investment","story":"Politicians say expected announcement of $12m must not have conditions attached Greenlanders have welcomed reports that the US wants to invest in their island, but said the money had to come without conditions.The US administration is expected to announce the opening of an Agency for International Development office at the new US consulate in the capital, Nuuk, and at least $12m (£9.7m) in aid projects.The announcement, expected on Thursday in Washington, will come less than a year after President Donald Trump drew derision for expressing an interest in buying Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. But suggestions of a greater US presence in Greenland were met with criticism in Greenland and Denmark on Thursday.Aaja Chemnitz Larsen from the left-leaning opposition party Inuit Ataqatigiit described it as a charm offensive.“The Americans are welcome if they want to invest in Greenland,” she said. “But it is important to make sure that Greenland doesn’t owe anything back to the United States. We are sceptical about what they really want besides influence.”She added that it must clear what the money should be spent on.Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, an associate professor with the Royal Danish Defence College in Copenhagen, said the US had been missing out in terms of its Arctic strategy, giving Russia and China a head start in the region, and was now coming back with a large sum of money. They are trying to get back to having a presence in the Arctic and are doing it “with a big fanfare”, he said.An opinion piece written earlier this week by the American ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, previewed the announcement and said the US would be the preferred partner in the Arctic, a comment that sparked harsh reactions in Denmark.“They have clearly crossed the line,” said Carsten Hønge, an outspoken member of the left-leaning Socialist People’s party that supports the Social Democrat-led minority government. “We must draw a line in the ice cap.”Søren Espersen of the opposition Danish People’s party told the Danish broadcaster DR that financial aid was something you say about developing countries. “But Greenland is not a developing country. It is a western democracy. I think its reprehensible.”Greenland covers 2.166m sq km (836,000 sq miles) but has a population of only 56,000, mainly Inuits.Greenland harbours some of the largest deposits of rare-earth metals, including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, along with uranium and the byproducts of zinc.US corporations once thought of China as a benign supplier of rare-earth metals for mobile phones, computers and more recently electric cars. And the US government was relaxed when Chinese companies began hoovering up mines across\u0026nbspcentral and southern Africa\u0026nbspto secure an even greater dominance of the global market.But the arrival of\u0026nbspXi Jinping\u0026nbspas China’s leader, and his more aggressive foreign policy stance, has spooked many US policymakers. Among Trump’s advisers, the need for greater economic independence has raced up the agenda.A potential target for the US is\u0026nbspGreenland Minerals, an Australian company that has generated a good deal of excitement since it started operating\u0026nbspon Greenland’s south-west peninsula\u0026nbspin 2007 to develop the Kvanefjeld mine, which is home to many rare-earth metals.More than 100m tonnes of ore are believed to be sitting below the surface and the project is expected to become one of the largest global producers outside China.Last August, Trump’s desire to buy Greenland emerged in press reports in Washington. The Inuit premier, Kim Kielsen, said at the time the island was not for sale, while the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said: “Greenland is not Danish. Greenland is Greenlandic. I persistently hope that this is not something that is seriously meant.”Even there, conditions are far from ideal, due to the long winter with frozen ports, 24-hour darkness and temperatures regularly dropping below -30C (-22F) in northern parts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/394ff13bc7c989c0ebf8a203852e241aebaa5784/444_67_4602_2762/master/4602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbef01dbdda598dc8cae247568539121","title":"how covid 19 poured cold water on netherlands eu romance","story":"Dutch opposition to recovery spending has overtones of British disillusionmentIsolated in a recent European Union council of ministers, with attitudes described by European leaders past and present as “repugnant”.It sounds like an old script of Britain in the EU. Yet it is the Netherlands that has found itself at the heart of the union’s most bitter row during the coronavirus pandemic. As EU leaders meet on Thursday for their fourth virtual crisis summit in seven weeks, the Dutch will once again be in the vanguard of opposition to plans for big spending on the recovery.British parallels only go so far. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European club and single currency, and does three-quarters of its trade with the EU. A year ago the prime minister, Mark Rutte, gave a sweeping vision of a savvier, more realpolitik-positioned EU in the world. Surveying “the chaos of Brexit”, Rutte said, “there is no such thing as splendid isolation”. Dutch Eurosceptic parties have quietly shelved visions of “Nexit”.And yet Dutch political scientist Catherine De Vries sees echoes of the British debate. The Dutch political class, which she notes like to describe their country as “the Netherlands Inc” have a transactional attitude to Europe. The Dutch have benefited tremendously from “the tree of European integration”, she observes. “Now that we have been able to reap the fruits of those developments, we are questioning whether we need the tree anymore or do we actually need to water the tree?“If Dutch politicians don’t explain for a very long time how the Dutch economy benefits from the single market, it’s very difficult to explain why the Dutch should pay for the single market … That reminds me very much of the British discussions.”The Dutch are hardly alone in keeping a flinty eye on EU spending. With Austria, Denmark and Sweden, the Dutch make up “the frugal four” that helped sink a deal on the next EU budget in February. But no other leader seems to cause as much irritation as Rutte, who arrived at the summit with a biography of Frédéric Chopin to get through that night, because “what else is there to do”. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was said to have been irked by Rutte’s “childish” behaviour, the Dutch daily Volkskrant reported.Rem Korteweg, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, blames “shambolic PR” by the powerful Dutch finance ministry and “poor diplomacy” for the current Dutch EU woes. Exhibit A is the Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, who voiced contrition after remarks questioning why some countries lacked financial buffers to cope with the coronavirus shock provoked a furious reaction.Korteweg thinks the Dutch also failed to see which way the Germans were leaning in a recent debate on crisis rescue plans, leaving them isolated at a Eurozone finance ministers’ meeting. “On economic and financial issues the Netherlands always likes to be Robin to Germany’s Batman,” he said. But it also suits Germany to have the Dutch “play the bad guy”, he added. “Germany having the Dutch on their outer right-hand flank allows Germany to play a more central and more mediating role.”Dutch author Joris Luyendijk points to political games ahead of next year’s elections. “One reason the Dutch are so loud is that Hoekstra is positioning himself to succeed Rutte as the Dutch prime minister and for that he needs to look tough. This is very British: playing domestic politics in Brussels.”However, there are deeper reasons for the cooling romance between Dutch political elites and Brussels. The Dutch, one of the largest small member states, have lost weight since enlargement to eastern Europe. Disaffection was evident in the resounding Dutch no to the EU constitution in 2005, which De Vries sees as opening the way to the more “transactional discourse” about the EU in domestic politics. “That was then exploited by the extreme right,” she says, who fanned claims about “‘an EU superstate and wasteful bureaucracy’.”Now the Netherlands is coming under pressure from France, Spain and Italy to pledge “solidarity”, code for more spending, either via shared debt, or massive grants to help the worst-hit countries. In an interview with the Financial Times, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, effectively pinned responsibility for the EU’s fate on Germany and the Netherlands agreeing “financial transfers and solidarity”. Anything less would fuel populism in Italy, Spain and perhaps France, the French president argued.It is an argument that cuts little ice in the Dutch parliament, where Rutte’s government has no majority in either chamber. Earlier this month seven lawmakers tabled a resolution against “debt union”, led by Pieter Omtzigt, an influential voice in the Christian Democratic Appeal party that is part of Rutte’s coalition. Asked if any Dutch government would agree mutualised debt, Omtizgt responded simply: “No.”Dutch government sources, in common with German ones, think others fail to appreciate big offers already made in the white heat of the crisis, from tearing up EU stability and growth pact rules, to the European Central Bank’s €750bn bond-buying programme and a €540bn rescue package.As other incumbent leaders across the world, Rutte is enjoying a surge in the polls, while his rivals in the far-right Freedom party and populist Forum for Democracy have been sinking. But politics is volatile. “A move towards eurobonds in March of next year would be a windfall for Forum for Democracy,” suggests Korteweg. “They would want nothing less than that Rutte is forced to sign up to a form of eurobonds and then cash in at the ballot box in March.”Luyendijk adds: “Macron is half-right because, yes, refusing mutualised debt will fuel populism in the south. But by adopting mutualised debt you are going to fuel populism in the north. Dutch train drivers work till 65 while their French colleagues can retire in their late or even early 50s. Where is the solidarity in that?” But never say never, he says. “Bluntness bordering on boorishness is quintessentially Dutch but so is, in this country of coalitions, flexibility and flip-flopping.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38c2a22b8327b1c8d8802d6da4b03a8f1cf1223/0_132_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb5b09cf8a6d45db672d7d3d556c866","title":"older people could face extended coronavirus lockdown lords hears","story":"Health minister refuses to deny people over 70 could be subject to further restrictionsPoliticians have warned that the government is considering a “blanket ban” to prevent older people leaving their homes during the coronavirus crisis.The health minister, Lord James Bethell, twice refused to deny that older people will be told to stay in extended lockdown in response to questions in the Lords on Wednesday.“I was very concerned by the government’s refusal to answer my question,” said Lord David Blunkett, the former home secretary. “Older people must not be subjected to arbitrary incarceration as well as isolation.”Blunkett asked Bethell what assessment the government has made of the impact of the restriction of movement on those defined on medical grounds as extremely vulnerable and what plans they have to change those restrictions.“The more the government make restrictions age-related rather than risk-related, the more they risk people pushing back very heavily and refusing to keep to the rules,” he said.“The government picked the arbitrary age of 70 out of the air back in March when they announced the initial lockdown based on age. Age is no longer a risk factor unless underlying health conditions are attached.”Ros Altmann, the former pension minister, said: “I have real fears that ministers are considering blanket bans to prevent older people leaving their homes during the current crisis. Ministerial responses suggest government advisers may be seriously recommending using chronological age as a criterion for deciding whether people will be allowed to leave their homes.“Such policies are normally the mark of authoritarian regimes, not a mature democracy. Collective punishment based on age should be no more acceptable than using gender, ethnicity or body mass index as defining factors.“Blaming the virus is not a valid justification. These are conscious policy decisions. Isolating all older people, if others are allowed out, also risks damaging their physical and mental health.”Bethell was forced to defend himself against accusations in the Lords from the former Labour energy minister Lord Truscott of a danger “that extending the lockdown for only certain groups might unintentionally discriminate against elderly and vulnerable people”.Bethell was also unable to satisfy Conservative peer Lord Lucas, who asked: “Can we please ensure that vulnerable people have agency, that those who want to act as the unvulnerable are allowed to, that grandparents who wish to see their children are allowed to and, at the same time, that those who are young and vulnerable are protected in their decision to continue to isolate and are not discriminated against because of it?”Bethell said: “It is an unfortunate fact that those who are medically vulnerable are singled out by the virus. We have to put in place measures to protect and safeguard their lives. It is the virus that makes this discrimination, not the government.The Department for Health and Social Care has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/982705cff3a5bfc1958e78b9e1eb016f5f6799ee/0_140_4186_2512/master/4186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a592ace4d6235d28f51316daacdd67","title":"public can choose scarves instead of masks say uk scientists","story":"Government experts expected to recommend medical grade masks for health workers onlyGovernment scientists are expected to recommend that the public should not wear medical face masks but could choose to wear a scarf or face covering during the coronavirus outbreak.The scientific advisory group on emergencies, known as Sage, meets on Thursday to discuss the benefits of masks and is expected to tell ministers that the medical grade coverings should be prioritised for health workers only.The World Health Organization has said there is little evidence masks act as a preventive measure to infection. However, some countries such as the US have made coverings mandatory for those going out in public. In Germany they must be worn on public transport.Scientists are believed to be split on how effective coverings can be in blocking the transmission of the illness to other people.England’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said the fact the issue was being debated means “the evidence either isn’t clear or is weak”.Asked on ITV’s Good Morning Britain whether face coverings could have an effect on the London underground, she said it was possible there could be “a very, very small potential beneficial effect in some enclosed environments”.She continued: “But the evidence is really very, very difficult to tease out. It is not a simple yes or no, unfortunately.”Countries insisting people use masks when they are out in public are usually coupling the instruction with very strict physical distancing, which makes it hard to tell which is making a difference.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said it would be unlikely the government could provide free face masks to the public and the priority would remain giving medical masks to health staff.The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said the government would take a view on Sage’s advice on face masks but the core message continued to be that people should be physical distancing.He said it was not right to compare the UK’s stance on face masks with other countries’ because each nation was at a different stages of the virus cycle. Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there was no research to support wearing a mask if you were fit and well, and there was even a risk of picking up the infection if people were constantly adjusting it and touching their face.He said: “However, it’s common sense that if someone is coughing and spluttering then it makes complete sense to wear masks in order to protect other people and I think that’s what this is about.World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.There is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.-\u0026nbspHow to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask – no sewing required“I think the guidance we’re expecting to hear that people wearing a face mask is a voluntary activity, not mandated, makes sense and certainly makes a lot of sense to focus limited resources that we have at the moment on those who have greatest need and that’s the health professionals.”He said people with common viruses and colds might want to wear a mask in public once restrictions had been lifted further down the line.He said: “This sophisticated kit is likely to be more rigorous, more useful, but actually it’s perfectly reasonable to wear a bandanna around your mouth or whatever, that will work. It won’t be quite as good but it will be good enough given the evidence you’re not protecting yourself by wearing these masks unless you happen to be coughing and spluttering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe7ff26500a707bd817940dfab8604498055383a/60_129_2056_1234/master/2056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f11a181ba368381b45ad77c6eaf6a760","title":"test trace contain how south korea flattened its coronavirus curve","story":"As life begins to return to something like normality in Seoul and beyond, other countries are asking what lessons can be learnedLate last week millions of South Koreans queued patiently at polling stations to cast their votes for a new national assembly. If any uttered words of frustration from behind their masks, they were out of earshot of their fellow voters, kept at a distance by duct tape marking appropriate intervals.As they waited to wash their hands and pull on disposable plastic gloves before entering the booths, some may have allowed themselves to contemplate life beyond exercising their democratic right: an imminent return to work, a round of golf or, at last, a chance to shop for something more indulgent than food and hand sanitiser.Going out for dinner, let alone voting in a national election, would have seemed almost inconceivable weeks earlier when the coronavirus threatened to exact the same relentless toll on South Koreans as it has in the US and parts of Europe.Long before politicians in Britain accepted that the illness posed a serious threat to public health, South Korea watched the rise in reported daily infections with growing alarm. After the country reported its first case on 20 January, numbers initially remained low before climbing sharply, reaching a peak of 909 daily infections on 29 February.Then something extraordinary happened. The steep rise in cases began to plateau. By late March, daily infections were being counted in the dozens, and then in single digits. In the space of a few weeks, South Korea had flattened the curve.Other countries are now looking to South Korea and its three guiding principles on how to reign in the outbreak: test, trace and contain.Perhaps most striking is South Korea’s ability to tame the coronavirus without resorting to lockdowns of the kind imposed in the UK, Italy and France. In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed elsewhere, South Koreans for the most part stayed calm. There were no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing were waiting to be tested or to buy face masks … or to vote.By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to “test, test, test”, South Korea had spent weeks doing just that, quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12,000 people – and sometimes as many as 20,000 – a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes, with the results were sent to people’s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270,000 people had been tested.Testing aside, South Korea – the most connected country in the world – also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing. People who tested positive were asked to describe their recent movements, aided by GPS phone tracking, surveillance camera records and credit card transactions. Those details enabled the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to issue alerts, in real time, about where infected people had been before their positive status was confirmed.Amid criticism that the system could trample on privacy, the alerts contained only the gender and age category of each infected person, and names and addresses of the places they had visited.Jerome Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, said South Korea had contained the virus through “decisive and transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Aside from testing people and tracking, isolating and treating those infected, the government convince millions of citizens to alter their behaviour, setting out clear principles for physical distancing, and companies were encouraged to allow employees to work from home.“There was compliance with advisories for social distancing and hygiene, like avoiding bars, churches, gyms and hagwon cram schools,” Kim said. “Voluntary cooperation by an informed populace has been a notable feature of the response.”South Korea had already learned a harsh lesson about the cost of delayed action. In 2015 the Middle East respiratory syndrome killed 36 people, infected 186 and forced thousands into quarantine in an outbreak traced to a single visitor from overseas.Its approach has inevitably attracted international attention. The president, Moon Jae-in, has embarked on a campaign of “coronavirus diplomacy” with other world leaders, and the country has exported test kits to at least 20 nations including the US.The government’s newly released playbook on how to contain the coronavirus, Flattening the curve on Covid-19: the Korean experience, says: “South Korea successfully flattened the curve on Covid-19 in 20 days without enforcing extreme draconian measures that restrict freedom and movement of people.”While health officials remain cautious for fear of a second wave of infections, life is slowly returning to a version of normality. This week restrictions on shops, restaurants, bars, gyms, cram schools and religious services – the latter the source of the country’s biggest single outbreak – were relaxed. National parks, forests and arboretums, which are believed to carry lower risks of infection, are set to open gradually, while physical distancing will remain in place until at least early May.“Until we reach herd immunity or we achieve similar levels with a safe and effective vaccine, the new normal, with a stress on hygiene, social distancing and potentially local crackdowns, may continue,” said Kim.The ruling party’s comfortable victory in last week’s national assembly elections has been interpreted as popular approval of the government’s handling of the crisis. But as in so many other countries, the highest praise is reserved for exhausted health workers.“I think the government has done a reasonably good job,” said Lee Mi-young, 35, who spent time in hospital after contracting the virus from her husband. “I know that other countries are looking to South Korea as the numbers have gone down here, but I think it is because of the hard work of health officials, not the politicians.”Whichever group deserves credit, South Koreans are eyeing a time in which Covid-19 is no longer the sole determinant of the way they live. There was evidence of that in Seoul this week where people were returning to work and flocking to shopping malls and restaurants.For Kim Tae-hyung, a 31-year-old engineer from Seoul, the cautious embrace of a post-pandemic world meant once again playing the game he loves.“I’m a member of a community football club and we went out to play on Saturday for the first time in two months,” he said. “We were wearing masks while we played, and we were still worried about the coronavirus. But the weather was lovely. And I felt refreshed.”Nemo Kim contributed reporting from Seoul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4246ac41ff907d42a2810a64f1a7bae130a3932b/0_26_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=687631ec2c457126fb77a611795c57fa","title":"uk making impossible demands over europol database in eu talks","story":"The British government is making impossible demands over access to Europol databases in the negotiations over the future relationship with the EU, according to a leaked assessment of the UK’s position drawn up by the German government.As talks between the two sides resumed via video calls this week, Britain’s negotiators not only refused to extend the transition period because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but also stated the UK side’s eagerness to continue taking part in EU-wide data-sharing arrangements and even expanding their reach.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.According to a German government report on the UK’s position in the Brexit talks, seen by the , Britain wants to “approximate the position of a member state as closely as possible” when it comes to working with Europol, the EU’s law enforcement agency.This included a desire to continue to access Europol’s central intelligence database (EIS) – a wish the German report, summarising the EU’s position, described as “not possible”.Other data-sharing schemes the UK had expressed an interest in included the Schengen Information System (SIS II), a database used by European border control agencies that includes around 90m entries, as well as a vast collection of air passenger data (PNR), which British negotiators have proposed extending to cover those travelling on boats and by rail.Britain’s request for special access to these databases has been met with particularly vocal opposition in Germany, which has until now been seen as a more moderating influence in the negotiations but where data protection is a highly sensitive topic.Christian Petry, spokesperson for European affairs for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) that forms the German government with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, told the  he was “very critical” of British claims to levels of control and influence on security affairs usually reserved for members of the EU and the passport-free Schengen zone.“The Brexiteers have always disparaged the EU as undemocratic,” Petry said. “To now dictate to the EU as a third country how we should organise our inner security, that would indeed be undemocratic. It would not only be ‘cherry-picking on speed’, but set a fatal precedent. With what arguments could we respond to wishes from other states with similar ideas?”The German Green party said Britain could only hope to take part in data-sharing schemes if it accepted the EU’s standards for data protection, and therefore the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.“Otherwise we are endangering the basic rights of our citizens, which is not something we can tolerate,” said Franziska Brantner of the German Greens, who are currently second in polls to Merkel’s CDU. “Rights also come with responsibilities”.UK officials have argued in the negotiations that they are making a pragmatic offer of strong cooperation and that a refusal to engage with the proposals will lead to a mutual loss in capability to fight crime and terrorism.Sources suggested that those who claimed the UK was trying to attain the benefits of membership while outside the EU were misrepresenting the British position.The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, has repeatedly emphasised that his stance builds on relationships the EU has with other so-called “third countries” not in the bloc.But some German politicians are particularly indignant at the idea that the UK could continue to take part in the Schengen Information System (SIS), since the decision to allow Britain to take part in the scheme five years ago has already proven controversial.A 2018 report by the Council of the European Union found that the UK was making improper use of the database by illegally copying classified personal information and sharing it with US companies.“It is nothing short of brazen by the British government to want to take part in Europe’s largest police database in spite of repeatedly breaking its rules,” said Andrej Hunko, a spokesman on European affairs for Die Linke, the German left party.“Instead, the commission must initiate an immediate expulsion from SIS, as officials in Great Britain still refuse to address a list of deficiencies compiled by the European commission in January.” Hunko said his party would “put up resistance” against the British proposals in Germany and at an EU level.EU officials said the last week of negotiations covering trade, police and judicial cooperation and governance of the future relationship, had not made any significant progress. “There is a chasm,” said the source.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is expected to offer an uncompromising view when he speaks to reporters on Friday.A Home Office spokesman said: “The safety and security of our citizens is the government’s top priority and we are working closely with the European Union to reach an agreement on law enforcement and criminal justice cooperation in criminal matters that works for both of us.“The agreement should equip operational partners on both sides with the capabilities that help protect citizens and bring criminals to justice – promoting the security of all our citizens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073ee6bd292ced927818773f551fb00441c94f73/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f438db195c1974e4812569de96a9f74","title":"uk muslims embrace technology for ramadan","story":"Mosques are on lockdown and turning to social media to keep in touchFrom rustling up meals to break the fast using recipes on YouTube to listening to sermons via Zoom, this year’s Ramadan will be unique for Britain’s estimated 2.6 million Muslims with a reliance on technology due to coronavirus.With the first day of fasting due on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, mosques in the UK are adapting to the lockdown measures by turning to social media and apps to keep in touch with worshippers by livestreaming motivational lectures, courses and prayers.Facebook Live, Instagram, the Houseparty app and YouTube are expected to be among the sources for those abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset each day to prevent any potential spiritual vacuum caused by the closure of places of worship since late March.Imran Choudhury, 31, from Luton, a mosque volunteer, believes Islamic places of worship have an opportunity to connect with young Muslims via technology.He said: “The mosques for me are spiritual hubs, a place where I can recharge my faith in God. Now that they are closed it’s become really important that I fill that spiritual void.“There’s only so much you can listen to on YouTube but having a live connection with your imam and local scholars through Mixlr, GoMeet or Zoom, is a great way of keeping spirits high.“I think, in a positive way, this will definitely become the norm even after things have calmed down.“By using these platforms, the mosques are also capturing the attention of a demographic which have been increasingly hard to reach – the youth. I know many young people are listening to sermons from their local mosques as opposed to the usual ‘social media’ scholars online.”Mosques around the country are traditionally full with a congregation for the daily Taraweeh night prayers which often finish around midnight. For the next 29 or 30 days of Ramadan, those prayers along with the five daily prayers will be undertaken from home.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, actor Riz Ahmed and television presenter Konnie Huq are among the prominent British personalities who have collaborated for a new coronavirus advice video for the #RamadanAtHome campaign.Among the mosques using conferencing apps to connect virtually with Muslims in lockdown are the Bury Park Jamie Masjid and Leagrave Hall Masjid in Luton.Ashfaque Chowdhury, a member of the management team at Leagrave Hall Masjid, said: “Covid-19 has had tremendous impact on communities and has isolated them to their homes with little availability of spiritual moral social, cultural and mental health support.“To rise to the challenge, Leagrave Hall Masjid has digitised its facilities online with live Friday sermons via Mixlr and GoMeet.“Prayers for the deceased are now performed with their families online via go to meeting and Google classrooms is used to keep the teaching of the Qur’an alive amongst the young people.”Finsbury Park mosque in north London will be streaming lectures and prayers and offering online counselling while volunteers will distribute food to staff at local hospitals.Cambridge Muslim College is hosting a curated series of daily online talks from scholars on topics including the Qur’an, hadith, self-improvement, arts, culture and astronomy.Other virtual initiatives include the Ramadan Tent Project, where people sign up to receive recipes, decorations and games and can participate in a virtual Iftar via the Zoom app.With many restaurants closed and government advice to avoid visiting friends and family, Muslims are increasingly turning to bloggers and chefs on social media for inspiration for recipes to prepare the morning Suhoor meal at dawn and the evening meal at around 9pm.They include Alia Al Kasimi, a chef of Moroccan heritage, who has 357,000 YouTube subscribers.Bilal El Amri, 36, a facilities assistant in London, will be turning to the Cooking with Alia YouTube channel for inspiration.He said: “This year I will watch a recipe video three or four times, write down ingredients, see if I have them in the fridge, buy the ingredients I need then come back and start cooking to the recipe.“Alia’s website and YouTube channel has so many recipes which remind me of my Moroccan background.“Things I haven’t tasted for months or even years. It makes me feel close to my family, it triggers part of my muscle memory from the past.“I make tagines, harira soup, lots of mezes with olives. On a weekend I will make a fish cake.”He added: “Normally during Ramadan I would go to my cousin’s house to break the fast a few times, invite friends round, or prepare food with my wife and then go to the masjid.“With my cousins in London we will have a Skype video conference, we can even pray together virtually.”The Muslim Council of Britain has published guidelines on how to celebrate Ramadan in lockdown with advice on how to arrange “virtual iftars” online with family, friends and community members by using video chat.The guidelines also encourage people to buy food for the iftar meal in advance to avoid multiple shopping trips.It says: “Due to the likely inability to host in-person iftars this Ramadan, one way to connect with friends and loved ones is to host ‘virtual iftars’, in which iniduals or families can join via video conferencing facilities like Zoom, FaceTime or video-calling apps like Skype or WhatsApp.“This could be an important way for iniduals to stay connected during these times, especially for those who are living alone or away from family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd269af1ae0ddd453e87e877c926eff82b381b6d/0_352_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9ce2ff1ffd9ef23e108fb1f9e1fddd6","title":"what would year physical distancing mean for uk","story":"Some restrictions likely to be gradually eased but older people may be stuck at homeThe public has been warned to brace themselves for another year of physical distancing measures, with the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, saying it was time to be realistic about what lies ahead.But what would a new normal of physical distancing look like?Construction and manufacturing are likely to be at the forefront of a phased sectorial return that would be based on a traffic-light system, particularly given the pressure from Conservative MPs. New government guidance was recently issued saying such work could continue if done in line with physical distancing rules “wherever possible”.Shops could return next, subject to reduced opening hours and strict rules on customer numbers at any one time, and would include hairdressers, DIY retailers and garden centres.In terms of non-essential services, they could be followed by restaurants and pub, though again with physical distancing on tables and a cap on customer numbers.Last to come back would be arts and culture, including cinemas and theatres, while Premier League football matches would initially be played behind closed doors, perhaps with some screened on free-to-air TV. The National Theatre is hoping to reopen in July, while planning for scenarios that might push it back as late as January or after. The government said in March it would be contacting 1.5 million people to tell them they should be “shielding” on account of being at a higher risk from coronavirus due to factors such as their age or underlying health conditions. However, that number could grow.The increase would be driven by information provided by GPs tasked with finding out more about other patients, who might then be told to follow similar advice.If such groups have to confine themselves to their homes for another year, or until a vaccine is ready, then enhancements are likely to be made to processes including the employment of an army of volunteers and online delivery systems.One approach that has been discussed by policymakers, and proposed by researchers such as those at Warwick University, would involve a youth-first policy allowing for younger worker in their 20s and 30s, and who no longer live with their parents, to return to work first.While younger groups are not impervious to Covid-19, they are regarded as the most resilient. Such an approach has led some to joke that there could even be a maximum drinking age in the bars that might open at the same time.By contrast, vulnerable and older people – specifically those aged above 70 – might have to remain in their homes for at least another year or until a vaccine is developed.While there is a case for reopening smaller schools first, one proposal is for secondary schools and above to open initially, as older students would be more likely – in theory – to abide by physical distancing and travel by themselves. In England the most likely are years 10 and 12 - the first years of GCSE and A-levels respectively.In terms of primaries, one idea floating around government is that year 6 – comprising 10- and 11-year-olds – could be allowed back. Other proposed measures include staggering opening times, capping numbers and hours, altering term times and providing protective equipment for staff staff in some instances.Unless current government advice changes, Britons will not be ordered to wear masks in public, although they could become more commonplace if mayors including London’s Sadiq Khan continue to back them.But it appears other measures, including floor markings inside and outside supermarkets, are here to stay and may well be expanded. Temperature screening, of the type that customers in China’s shops and travellers at some international airports have become used to, could also appear.A concept that could gain traction again is that of immunity passports for people who have antibodies after previously contracting coronavirus and could return to workBut this is complicated, not least by problems with testing, unsettled science around immunity and fears some may want to become deliberately infected.Amid an unprecedented global surge in digital surveillance, many might also be concerned by steps towards tracking of the type credited in South Korea with suppressing the pandemic there at an early stage.An NHS app is being tested that would allow people to report their symptoms and then anonymously alert other users that had been in contact with that person in recent days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5453f5d5b00e1ccd5a0b0906ff914971429827e8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087c46ce7e1f2c6da2c20ebd5724c5f5","title":"why the uk is finding it so hard to reach 100000 covid 19 tests a day","story":"A slow start, top-down approach and long-term cuts to local services meant target was always going to be ambitiousOn 2 April, the day that he emerged from quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19, Matt Hancock stood at the Downing Street podium for the daily coronavirus press conference and made an announcement that was greeted in some quarters by a sharp intake of breath.“I’m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I’m determined we’ll get there,” said the health secretary, who had tested positive around a week earlier.It amazed many observers, but it wasn’t the most ambitious testing target the government had put forward. On 25 March, under pressure on testing and claiming the UK was doing better than other countries, the prime minister said: “We are going up from 5,000 to 10,000 tests per day, to 25,000, hopefully very soon up to 250,000 per day.”But even the lower numbers have never stacked up. With less than a week to go until his self-imposed deadline, and in spite of buoyant talk by ministers and advisers, many believe that the 100,000 target to which Hancock has so firmly committed himself will also be missed.A massive effort to set up big new laboratories and engage smaller ones, the “little ships”, to help, along with a plan for 50 drive-through centres, has certainly increased capacity. But with a week to go, the UK finds itself with capacity for 40,000 tests a day – and only half that number being carried out. It is well short of the pledge – and more importantly, if the intention is for the UK to test its way out of lockdown, it is not enough.If the target is missed, there is a risk that blame may be deflected on to the tens of thousands of health workers and key workers themselves. Hancock has already said that they are not turning up at the drive-through centres in the numbers expected. But in fact nurses and doctors have ended up self-isolating because of the long distances they would have to drive to get tested – and there have been stories of some being turned away when they get there.And as strategists and politicians start to map out the exit from lockdown, the question of resources for local public health teams that have been stripped back over a decade of austerity will become increasingly urgent. The regular – maybe even weekly - testing of those on the frontline and tracking down contacts has to be done locally. It cannot be run, as so much of the epidemic response has been so far, from Westminster.But to understand how that pledge began to seem so out of reach, it is essential to look first at how the government’s approach to it began: slowly. The UK started ramping up testing too late, having abandoned it as a core principle when Johnson declared we could no longer contain the virus on 12 March. People with symptoms should just stay at home, he said. Only hospital patients would be tested. That meant Britain went to the back of the queue for test kits, reagents and other commodities that all the world was scrambling for.Testing, followed by contact tracing and quarantine, is the standard public health response to an infectious disease epidemic, supported loudly by the World Health Organization, whose director general said it should be “the backbone of the response in every country”. The UK had other ideas, but as the numbers admitted to hospital rose and NHS staff began to have to stay home because they or their family fell ill, the demand for testing became more and more vocal.Promises began to be made. In an odd disconnect, NHS and Public Health England had said they intended to reach 10,000 tests a day on 11 March, just the day before Johnson declared the contain phase was over and that people with symptoms should stay home untested. Just 1,215 people had been tested by that stage.The issue got hotter. On 18 March, Johnson declared the UK would do 25,000 tests a day, but did not say when. On 29 March, Hancock tweeted that they had reached the 10,000 a day target and were on course for 25,000. The watchdog organisation Full Fact, however, later said the data did not support the claim. The highest number tested in a day in England had been 9,114 at that time.Then on 2 April, Hancock made the pledge that threatens to “come back and bite him”, according to the  this week, which cited “a Number 10 insider” as its source. They would do 25,000 tests a day by mid to late April, and 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.With the prime minister in isolation in Downing Street with symptoms, and a need to put an end to the difficult questions about why the UK lagged behind, the health secretary made some admissions.Unlike Germany, the UK did not have a huge diagnostics industry, he said, so had been “catching up”. He acknowledged that global demand had led to a shortage of both swabs and reagents. The swabs issue had been fixed but “we are still tackling the reagents issue, which is a global challenge”, he said.In a rare moment, he admitted the government had not got everything right. “There will be criticisms made, and some of them will be justified.” But he also had a reassuringly substantial sounding plan for what was next, from bringing in commercial partners to scaling up Britain’s diagnostic capacity: the ”five pillars”.However many pillars there were, 100,000 tests a day was such a big number that it was assumed the government was including antibody tests to demonstrate people had been infected in the past, as well as the PCR swab tests for people with symptoms.The government had been enthusiastic about the possibility of a fingerprick antibody test anyone could do at home, like a pregnancy test. Johnson on 19 March said at the daily briefing: “To give you an idea of what is coming down the track, we’re in negotiations today to buy a so-called antibody test, as simple as a pregnancy test which can tell whether you have had the disease and it’s early days, but if it works as its proponents claim, then we will buy literally hundreds of thousands of these kits as soon as practicable. Because obviously it has the potential to be a total game-changer.”Public Health England’s director of infections, Prof Sharon Peacock elaborated on 25 March when she told the science and technology committee of MPs that a simple home test would be available within days.So the 100,000 tests are PCR swab tests for current viral infection only and all the stops have been pulled out to get there. On Wednesday, the Department for Health and Social Care hailed the “biggest network of diagnostic labs in British history”, built in five weeks flat. Three mega-labs would process samples from 27 of the planned 50 drive-through test centres. Dozens of universities, research institutes and companies were lending equipment. The UK’s two biggest drug companies, Astra Zeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, are collaborating on a fourth lab to open in Cambridge.And yet, only half the daily 40,000 test capacity is being used. Hancock talked of lower-than-expected demand and has thrown it open to other key workers outside the NHS, including social care workers, police, prison officers, social workers and frontline benefits staff.But there is a fundamental problem. Key workers don’t want a long drive at the end of a gruelling shift on the frontline to get tested.“What I’m hearing from the frontline is that nurses are driving up to two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus and driving to testing stations, and sometimes if you haven’t got an appointment you’re turned away only to be told to come back another time,” Dame Donna Kinnair, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told the health and social care select committee.The British Medical association estimated on Wednesday that nearly 100,000 health workers were self-isolating because the testing sites were not easy to get to.Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for north-west England, said the government’s battle plan against Covid-19 had been so centralised and top-down that they hadn’t tried to ask people what would work for them in their locality.“You have to go to them. They should be testing them as they leave work,” he said. “It’s the same issue with immunisation.” Offering nurses flu jabs in the hospital as they arrive or go home has successfully raised rates in the past.Importantly, testing is not an end in itself. When the UK attempts to lift the lockdown, testing, tracing the contacts of anyone who is positive and ensuring they isolate themselves is essential. Key workers running higher risks may have to be tested weekly. That needs to be run locally, by people who understand the community they live and work in.In the heyday in the 70s, Liverpool had 6,000 public health staff, including community nurses, health visitors, people working in food hygiene and many others. “Now they’d be lucky to have 30 or 40 staff,” he said. “Bolton has got four in its public health team.”The epidemic will not behave in the same way in every part of Britain. Once out of UK-wide lockdown, cases will flare in one region or another and the best firefighters will be local public health teams. These are people who know their communities.It is the local teams, says Ashton, who could have made the next chapter less disastrous than the current one.“They are the ones that should be leading on contact tracing and testing programmes,” he said. “This can’t be done from Whitehall.” The problem is, in many cases, they no longer exist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbe1f950ed12fee89173fe1355a297e53a150388/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4378e22740e47c17d9100470a34de9a","title":"see how coronavirus can spread through a population and how countries flatten the curve","story":"One important characteristic of viruses and other pathogens is how contagious they are.This is measured in a few ways. One key measure is the R0, or basic reproduction number, which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates.For an R0 of three we would expect each new case of a disease to produce three other infections.This is not just a measure of the inherent infectiousness of a disease. It also depends on other factors, including the rate of contact within a population and the duration of the infectious period. It\u0027s a situation-dependent value, so in one city the R0 might be higher and in another lower. It also assumes that the entire population is susceptible to the disease.So what does that look like, and how does it compare with other diseases?How does Covid-19 compare with other diseases?Here, you can see the same spread patterns generated based on the R0 for a range of pathogens in a range of situations, ranging from Spanish flu to the highly contagious measles, for which R0 has been estimated to range between 12 and 18.But the R0 is not the only important number. The effective reproduction number, R, is a value that takes into account the susceptibility of the population.Here, you can set the thresholds for different values and see the result using our simplified model. The reality of pandemics is far more complex but this does demonstrate the basic concepts underlying the spread of diseases. This model uses a hypothetical population of 1,000 people to better visualise the proportion of infections and deaths, and assumes that every person can come into contact with every other person in the population.Choose a case study or use the sliders to see a scenario play outThe isolation value is not used for most of the case studies as isolation data is not usually available.R0 references for other diseases: Sars, Spanish flu, Chickenpox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31/0_194_5870_3524/master/5870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=098e71ea152389644e35e176e5c760c0","title":"animals roaming streets coronavirus lockdown photos","story":"Animals have started taking advantage of cities as they enter lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.

He said: This cleaner air should not just be temporary as Londoners deserve clean air at all times.So, once the current emergency has passed and we start to recover, our challenge will be to eradicate air pollution permanently and ensure the gains we’ve made through policies such as ULEZ (ultra-low emissions zone) continue.It is critical that government keeps this in mind as part of the country’s recovery from the pandemic.Human trials for a coronavirus vaccine in the UK are due to get under way, with hundreds of people volunteering to be part of the study.Researchers from the University of Oxford will administer the first dose to a healthy person on Thursday afternoon, while another will be given a meningitis vaccine, used in the trial for comparison.The Oxford Vaccine Group hopes to repeat the process with six more volunteers on Saturday, moving to larger numbers on Monday.Up to 1,102 participants will be recruited across multiple study sites in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol.Lydia Guthrie, who will begin taking part in the Oxford vaccine trial in a week, told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One programme: They’re really clear with us that as participants we can pull out at any time if we change our minds.She added that after receiving either the Covid-19 vaccine candidate or the meningitis jab, she would go about her normal life, keeping a diary about how she feels, or any symptoms.Asked why she volunteered, Guthrie said: I guess when I saw the advert looking for participants, it felt to me like a small contribution I can make to this team of over 500 participants and scientists and clinicians working hard together to develop a vaccine.Dedicated staff at a care home are living in tents to help protect the residents from Covid-19.The move has been taken by nine members of staff at the Victoria House Care Home in Ryde, Isle of Wight, as part of its “no one in and no one out” policy to provide maximum protection for their 20 residents aged between 82 and 103. Manager Claire Leggett told the PA Media news agency: It was the staff that came up with the idea of the tents, I was initially thinking of arranging for them to stay in the home but we don’t have facilities.This is an old Victorian house with 20 residents in 20 rooms, there is no extra space so it was a case that we will put the staff where we need to put them.I’m not sure how it will work long term but they are coping really well, I have such a good team around me.We have been locked down to the public now for about three weeks, and the staff have been living in for about eight days.We have some really old residents, our eldest is 103 and they are just like family, I would be mortified if anything were to happen.The virus is going through care homes like wildfire, and I didn’t want it to come in and then to lock it down inside, I felt I had to take action, I had no choice.A 12-year-old boy has raised more than £4,000 for the NHS by cycling 740km during a 36-hour indoor cycling challenge to accompany Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas.Mak Larkin, from Hastings, East Sussex, set himself the target of riding three 12-hour shifts with the Olympic gold medallist using the indoor cycling app Zwift to raise money for NHS Charities Together.His mother, Lynsey Larkin, told the PA Media news agency that her son had received messages of support from around the world, including from from cyclists such as Tom Pidcock, Cameron Mason, Ben Tulett and Team Ineos, and a tweet from Thomas who completed 1,200km and raised £360,000.Walsall council has adopted the use of digital postmortem technology in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing non-invasive autopsies using CT images.The West Midlands authority has entered into a five-month agreement with pathology services company iGene to use the technology to carry out postmortems from next Monday. The digital autopsies are undertaken at the Sandwell Valley Crematorium, where iGene’s CT equipment is based.Walsall joins Dudley, Sandwell and Wolverhampton in using the technology, which will examine bodies deemed suitable for a digital autopsy as the first line of intervention.Councillor Garry Perry, Walsall’s cabinet portfolio holder for community, leisure and culture, said of the procedure: The technology has the added benefit of being able to identify the cause of death much quicker. At a time of this national emergency we must do everything possible to keep the NHS safe and save lives.Using digital autopsies will help us achieve this.Physical activity in England was at its highest ever level before the coronavirus outbreak, a new report has found, but there is emerging evidence that those gains could be undone because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Our colleague Sean Ingle has the full story here.In his column in this week’s Spectator, James Forsyth, the magazine’s political editor, says government insiders expect just a mild easing of the lockdown restrictions when they are reviewed next month. He says:The Department for Health and Social Care has published the latest figures for the number of UK hospital coronavirus deaths. Another 616 people have died, taking the total hospital death tol to 18,738.As DHSC explains in the small print of its tweet, today’s death toll is actually 638 higher than the total announced yesterday, but it has given the increase as 616 because the other 22 are accounted for by Northern Ireland revising their historic data.The former Labour prime minister Tony Blair has been calling this week for the government to bring in outside experts to help it implement mass testing, and all the other initiatives that will be needed for the lockdown to be eased. At an event for Tortoise Media last night, Blair said that Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary, was the sort of person he had in mind. As Matthew d’Ancona reports in his write-up for the Tortoise daily email, Blair said:Here is a  graphic showing the progress being made towards the target Matt Hancock set for coronavirus testing to reach a rate of 100,000 a day by the end of April.George Osborne, the Conservative former chancellor who now edits the Evening Standard in London, has praised Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, for her willingness to discuss with the public options for ending the lockdown. He accuses the UK government of refusing to treat people “like adults” because it is not willing to adopt the same approach.NHS England has announced 514 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 16,786. The full details are here (pdf).Of the 514 new deaths announced today:The figures also show 110 of the new deaths recorded took place between 1-19 April, and the remaining two deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 25 March.NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortems to be processed, and for data from the tests to be validated.The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day: 831.A further 17 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of deaths there to 641, Public Health Wales said.Another 234 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8,358.On Wednesday 816 tests were carried out, with a total of 28,904 carried out across Wales. There is current capacity for 1,800 tests daily.Dr Robin Howe, from Public Health Wales, said there was emerging evidence suggesting a levelling-off in the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Wales, which may be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures. He added:However, it is still too early to tell for sure, and it is too soon to end the current social distancing rules.Public Health Wales continues to fully support the extension of lockdown measures, which is essential to avoid reversing the gains we have made in slowing the spread of this virus, protecting our NHS, and saving lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/767e5433a46cbb49e2340479fe8df714fef53c65/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a854d0786ffaab7a8bd8e5bd5f8dc40c","title":"coronavirus live news us states start to reopen as detained wuhan journalist reappears","story":"Unemployment in US up by 4.4 million to a total of over 26 million world has ‘a long way to go’, warns WHO chief Iran reports lowest new daily infections for a monthMirroring a similar move by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates has shortened its nationwide coronavirus curfew by two hours for Ramadan, Reuters reports.The curfel will run daily from 10pm to 6am for the Muslim fasting month Ramadan, state news agency WAM said on Thursday. It had been in force from 8pm to 6am daily. It was unclear whether Dubai, one of the Gulf country’s seven emirates, which has been under a 24-hour curfew since 26 March, was included in the latest decision. Health care services in Gaza are not ready for an outbreak of coronavirus, the Red Cross has warned, as it donated intensive care equipment to the territory. Palestinians say 13 years of economic sanctions by Israel and its border blockade have crippled their economy and undermined the development of medical facilities, weakening their ability to face a pandemic.Hospitals in Gaza only have about 110 intensive care beds for adults, most of which are already occupied, and 93 ventilators, for a population of about 2million. The ICRC’s donation includes a ventilator, patient monitors, defibrillators, suction devices and pumps for treating patients suffering from serious cases of Covid-19.Announcing the donation on Thursday, Daniel Duvillard, head of the ICRC Delegation in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said:The prospect of COVID-19 escaping control in Gaza is frightening, given the weakness of the health system and the dense population of the Gaza StripFor the time being there have been only a handful of cases, but Gaza needs to stay vigilant. This equipment will help, yet much more is needed to help the local health facilities cope with any kind of scenario, including the worst-case one.With passage through Gaza’s borders tightly controlled by Israel and Egypt, so far there have been just 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Gaza. Quarantine facilities have been set up by local health authorities for Palestinians who enter via Egypt or Israel.The president of Botswana and all the country’s MPs ended 14 days of self-isolation on Thursday, after they were quarantined following contact with a nurse who had contracted the coronavirus. President Mokgweetsi Masisi and the country’s 63 legislators all tested negative for the virus, AFP reports. It was Masisi’s second period of quarantine in the past month. His office said in a statement:The director of health services has released (President) Masisi... and (Vice President) Slumber Tsogwane from home quarantine today.This follows release of their COVID-19 test results which came out negative.Botswana has recorded 22 coronavirus cases so far, including one death.Masisi has imposed a 28-day period of “extreme social distancing” from April 2 to limit the spread of infection.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said his country, until recently the World Health Organization’s biggest donor, may never restore funding to the UN health body. Last week Donald Trump announced he was freezing donations to the WHO, accusing it of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak. Late on Wednesday, Pompeo told Fox News the US government would “take a real hard look at the WHO”, adding that the US needed to see “a structural fix” with the way it operated. Asked if he was not ruling out a change in leadership of the WHO, Pompeo replied: “Even more than that, it may be the case that the United States can never return to underwriting, having US taxpayer dollars go to the WHO. We may need to have even bolder change than that.”A key minister in the government of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has urged media in Brazil to stop covering coffins and corpses after images of mass graves in the jungle city of Manaus emerged, and Brazil’s death toll from coronavirus continued to rise, Tom Phillips, the ’s Latin America correspondent, reports.General Luiz Eduardo Ramos said an overload of negative new coverage was spreading fear among the population, as Brazil’s confirmed cases reached 45,757 and deaths hit 2,906 – 165 of those reported in the last 24 hours.“On the morning news, it’s coffins, it’s bodies,” Ramos told reporters on Wednesday. “On the lunchtime news, it’s coffins, its bodies and it’s the number of deaths. I ask everyone, how do you think an older lady, a poor person, or a fragile person feels… It’s not helping.”The comments came after Brazilian TV showed footage of mourners beside a mass grave in Manaus. The Amazon city’s mayor, Arthur Virgílio Neto, cried during a newspaper interview on Tuesday and said doctors were reaching the point of having to decide who to save.On Wednesday, TV Globo broadcast cellphone footage of a doctor in Rio explaining he had one ventilator for 30 patients and had already lost two patients.But Ramos suggested more good news. “There is so much that is positive happening,” he said, suggesting more coverage of the “wonderful” work of health professionals, ignoring recent in-depth reporting on intensive care wards by the Folha de S.Paulo and O Globo newspapers.“Bolsonaro government working hard,” tweeted Michele Brasil under video of the briefing. “Working hard to destroy the country,” tweeted one user in reply.China did not cover up the novel coronavirus outbreak and so the United States should not seek to bully the People’s Republic in a manner reminiscent of the 19th century European colonial wars, the Chinese ambassador to London said on Thursday.Liu Xiaoming was quoted as saying by Reuters: I hear quite a lot of this speculation, this disinformation about China covering up, about China hiding something - this is not true ... The Chinese government was transparent and very quick to share data.... Some other country - their local courts sued China - it is absurd ... Some politicians, some people, want to play at being the world’s policeman - this is not the era of gunboat diplomacy, this is not the era when China was still a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society ... ... These people still live in the old days - they think they can bully China, think they can bully the world ... China is not an enemy of the United States - if they regard China as an enemy they chose the wrong target.You can see the ambassador’s comments - which came as a response to a question from a BBC reporter - for yourself in this video tweeted by the ambassador. The most interesting bit begins at about 1hr three minutes in. Liu comments come after the state of state of Missouri bizarrely decided to sue the Chinese government in an American court over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the global pandemic.The lawsuit, filed in federal court by the state’s top lawyer, alleges Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians”.Egypt has shortened its night-time curfew for an hour for the month of Ramadan, prime minister Mostafa Madbouly has said, according to Reuters. The curfew will start at 9pm instead of the previous 8pm and run until 6 am, Madbouly told a televised news conference. Ramadan, when Muslims fast until sunset, starts on Friday. In Egypt, fastb-breaking is around 6.30pm. Communal activities and mass prayers remain banned, but some restrictions were being eased, such as allowing shops and restaurants to deliver food, so long as infections do not begin to accelerate too quickly, Madbouly said. The WHO African region director, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, in a briefing today again emphasised the risk that lockdowns across Africa could hamper health services on the continent from tackling other diseases. Deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year if work to prevent the disease is disrupted by Covid-19, the World Health Organization has warned, Kaamil Ahmed reports.The UN’s global health agency said that if countries failed to maintain delivery of insecticide-treated nets and access to antimalarial medicines, up to 769,000 people could die of malaria this year. That figure, which would be more than double the number of deaths in 2018, would mark a return to mortality levels last seen 20 years ago.“While Covid-19 is a major health threat, it’s critical to maintain malaria prevention and treatment programmes,” said the WHO’s Africa director, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. “The new modeling shows deaths could exceed 700,000 this year alone. We haven’t seen mortality levels like that in 20 years. We must not turn back the clock.”The number of coronavirus patients in intensive care in Belgium has fallen below 1,000 for the first time since the end of last month. According to the latest epidemiological bulletin from Belgium’s Sciensano health institute, 993 patients were in intensive care beds with Covid-19 related health complications, a fall of 27 on the day before. It is the first time there have been fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 patients in Belgian ICU’s since 30 March. Overall, 4,527 patients were in hospital with the disease, 238 fewer than on Wednesday. The institute reported 908 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, 347 of which where in care homes. The death toll rose by 230, 93 of which were in hospital and 134 in care homes (of which 38 were confirmed Covid-19 cases and 96 were suspected).Overall, Belgium has recorded 42,797 coronavirus infections so far.

Photograph: Billy SticklandInphoAn international coalition of hundreds of organisations, scientists and philanthropists has announced its intention to “ignite a global movement to help accelerate an end to the Covid-19 pandemic” and enhance preparedness to stop future pandemics.The Pandemic Action Network (Pan) said it will seek policy changes and increased support and resources to ensure countries are better prepared “to prevent, detect and respond to pandemic threats”.The initiative includes a “For Humankind” resource, to promote accurate information to ensure people around the world understand what they need to do to protect themselves and their communities from Covid-19.Their first initiative under that heading is a major public health campaign called #MaskingForAFriend, encouraging people to join their call to action “by spreading the word about wearing homemade masks, and sharing a selfie image or video wearing a cloth face covering during essential errands or making masks” through that hashtag.“The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the extreme fragility in the ability of the world’s systems to respond to a new and highly infectious pathogen,” the alliance said in a statement.“While public health experts have been making this case for years, there has not been complementary policy, advocacy and communications support to create the political will necessary for policy and funding changes to enhance our preparedness,” it added.Irish communications specialist David Kyne of Evoke Kyne, a co-founder of Pan, said it was set up because of the absence of a global advocacy and policy group focused on preparedness for a pandemic.There was also a communications gap, he added, between what public health bodies were saying and what was reaching the public – though this was less of an issue in Ireland.Mr Kyne, who has worked on previous global public health campaigns on ebola and malaria, said they would be using “influencer” messaging but would follow health advice in particular jurisdictions and that of WHO.Given social distancing was not possible in many parts of the world widespread rumours about Covid-19 and many people not having access to TVs, communications campaigns such as the one on wearing of masks needed “to get in at community level”.Pan is supported by the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation other major philanthropists, international NGOs and private industry including vaccine developers Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.– Ensure full funding for the global and country-level Covid-19 response and future pandemic preparedness– Strengthen the global health security architecture for more effective pandemic preparedness and response– Accelerate research, development and access to innovations to combat Covid-19 and emerging pandemic threats.A core principle was “no one is safe until everyone is safe”, meaning an equitable global lens was crucial for a successful response, Pan added.“West Africa’s devastating ebola epidemic showed us that the world must come together to ensure countries are prepared for outbreaks, including that health workers on the frontlines have the gear and training they need to keep safe and keep serving,” said Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia and WHO goodwill ambassador.“Decisive political leadership and global cooperation will determine if we win the war against this invisible enemy, which is why we need Pan,” she added.It is putting in place an international expert advisory panel including Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine – a co-discoverer of the Ebola virus and founding executive director of UNAIDS.Captain of South Africa’s rugby team Siya Kolisi kicked off the #MaskingForAFriend campaign. His focus is on securing behaviour change in townships in his country, where wearing a homemade mask is needed given challenges with social distancing.“I am proud to use my platform to share accurate health information with as many people as possible to help stop this virus in its tracks,” he said. He called on other sports captains and leaders to model good protective behaviour – “whether it be staying home, washing hands or covering your face. We need to do it ‘For Humankind’.”Mr Kyne said he hoped sports captains in Ireland would row in with the campaign.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mark Burke\u0026rsquos wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him in ICUBoy allegedly hit one of the teachers in his secondary school with a brush lastyearConstruction to begin again at 35 \u0026lsquoessential\u0026rsquo social housing projects in the State that are nearing completionThree charged with travelling on false documents and training Farc rebels in 2001Judge hears woman, a ward of court in her 90s, has tested positive for diseaseThe Health and Safety Authority has launched an investigation into incidentWinning ticket was sold at Daly\u0026rsquos Supervalu store in KillarneyEmma Jane McParland (39) died from her injuries after she was stabbed on WednesdayJudge Brian O\u0026rsquoCallaghan in Cork says Covid-19 restrictions could hinder drug dealersTrue figure for deaths in community residential settings likely to higherFriends of the Irish Environment challenged An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela over planning permissionHealth authority says its childcare support survey generated limited informationFacility in Co Kilkenny, which houses more than 200 animals, relying on donationsOrange fire risk warning issued as farmers are urged not to clear land by burningNew scheme between An Post and independent booksellers announcedLockdown has brought falling crime rates, decline in court activity, say garda\u0026iacuteKevin Braney alleged laws under which he was arrested breached his human rightsPandemic Action Network formed to combat current global crisis and future pandemicsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236264.1587655770!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus man 47 whose family was told he only had 24 hours to live recovers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCovid-19 survivor Mark Burke has recovered and is now at home with his family in Co Wicklow. Photograph: LivelineA 47-year-old man who contracted coronavirus and whose family was told he only had 24 hours to live has recovered from the illness and his medical records will now be used for research to help treat the virus worldwide.Mark Burke, from Co Wicklow, was in ICU in St Vincent’s Hospital, Dublin, for four weeks. He developed a problem with his bowels, his lungs were failing, and medics believed he would not survive. His family were told to say goodbye to him.Mr Burke’s wife and children dressed in PPE and went to say goodbye to him while he was in ICU.“When the kids walked in, he opened his eyes he heard their voices. If you saw it in a movie, you wouldn’t believe it. You would think that it is so far fetched. He’s in a coma, he’s not coming out of it. He was in double organ failure, his lungs had failed him, his bowels had failed him, but when he heard his children, he opened his eyes and the nurses were witness to that.”Mr Burke’s family returned home and awaited a call from the hospital to update them on his condition.However, the father of four who had no underlying medical condition survived the next 24 hours, and medics began to provide him with various medications in a bid to improve his bowels to the point where they could operate on him.“They said he had a 5 per cent chance of regenerating enough of the bowel to stabilise him enough for the operating theatre. And it did happen,” Ms Burke said.“On the following Wednesday, they decided right he’s lasted Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - four days - and he didn’t deteriorate. He didn’t improve, but he didn’t deteriorate. That was shocking them.“They kept saying why is he not going into multi-organ failure”, why is he still with us? They couldn’t understand it. They said right, we’ve secured him enough, we’ve stabilised him enough. We were absolutely thrilled.

Photographer: Dara Mac Dónaill With shoppers visiting supermarkets in record numbers since the start of the coronavirus crisis, Ireland’s food safety watchdog has been prompted to clarify the key steps people need to take to keep themselves safe as they stock up on essentials.Recent retail data has shown that March was the biggest month of grocery sales recorded in Ireland with spending climbing by an average of 27 per cent with even more significant increases reported in some frozen foods and ambient food sections.There have also been reports of people taking drastic steps such as washing their groceries before storing them and even leaving products in quarantine for as much as 72 hours to ensure there are no traces of Covid-19 on packaging.Such actions are not needed, according to Dr Linda Gordon, the chief specialist in microbiology with Safefood.“Currently, there is no evidence that Covid-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging,” she said.She stressed that it was “important to follow good hygiene practices when handling or preparing foods. You should always wash your hands and surfaces often, separate raw meat from other foods, cook to the right temperature and put food in the fridge as soon as you can.”She said people should not wash or disinfect food packaging. “It’s not necessary to sanitise the outside of food packaging as there is no current evidence that the virus can be transmitted in this way.”She stressed that the main risk of transmission remained from close contact with infected people. “Our advice is to maintain good hygiene habits and to wash your hands regularly and to follow current public health guidelines re social distancing.”Two hoursShe also offered advice to consumers who may find themselves cooking more than they usually do.“Typically, if there is food left over after a meal, get it into the fridge within two hours – you can help cool it more quickly by iding it into smaller portions. However, remember that cooked rice is high-risk and must be cooled and put in the fridge within one hour. Any leftovers properly stored should be eaten within three days but if you’re in any doubt, throw it out into your brown bin.”She said a significant increase in online food shopping had highlighted the importance of storing and handling food at home properly.“As we would normally do, put away shopping as soon as you get it, especially perishable foods which must be stored in the fridge or freezer,” Dr Gordon said. “And always wash your hands after handling any food packaging and before you begin to prepare food. If you’re going food shopping for yourself or others, wash your hands before you go and, as soon as you come home and again after you unpack your shopping.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: CollinsThe Green Party has set out 17 demands that must be met before it would be amendable to consider coalition talks involving Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The demands include a commitment to very ambitious annual reductions of 7 per cent in carbon emissions a fifth of all transport capital spending to be ringfenced for cycling and walking, as well as two-thirds of the overall transport budget to be targeted at public transport rather than private transport.In its comprehensive response to the joint framework document agreed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael last week, the Green Party also calls for the ending of direct provision, the exploration of a universal basic income for everybody in society, as well as the halting of controversial fossil fuel infrastructure, including the planned liquid natural gas (LNG) plant earmarked for the Shannon Estuary area.The party has said that a ‘Green New Deal’ must be at the heart of any government that is formed in the 33rd Dáil.Party leader Eamon Ryan has said the challenging target of a seven per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions would effectively comprise a red line for the party.“If we were trying to go into government and we were not really ambitions in terms of climate change, I think it would be very hard for us to get it through our members, not alone that, but through our parliamentary party as well.”Mr Ryan, party chairman Roderic O’Gorman and Carlow-Kilkenny TD Malcolm Noonan expanded on the details of the document to the media on Thursday.Speaking outside Leinster House in Dublin, Mr Ryan emphasised it was not a government negotiation document but rather a clarification document specifically in response to the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael framework document.“We’ve a bit of time to start really thinking about what the next government is going to do, which is going to be charged with this economic recovery. That’s the big task. We think it can be green. We think Europe is looking in that direction for a European Green Deal,” he said.The document has stated a ‘Green New Deal’ recovery will provide just such a strategic approach.“It would allow us to build a new circular economy which is more secure and sustainable than the existing system. At the same time, it would allow us to forge a new social contract and address inequality for all our people,” it states.The party has posed its demands in the form of 17 questions to Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which cumulatively - if accepted - will result in very radical and dramatic change in the way Irish economy and society are ordered.“Over the past 40 years the Green Party has campaigned to create a fairer society within a circular economy that protects the environment we all share. We believe that the next ten years are critical if we are to address the climate and bioersity crisis which threatens our safety, security and of the next Government,” the document states.The 17 demands are:1. A seven per cent reduction in carbon emissions each year.2. Massive development in renewable energy infrastructure including off-shore wind, solar power and an upgrade of national grid.3. An end to exploration licences for offshore gas exploration.4. Stopping the fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly the LNG import terminal currently being planned for the River Shannon.5. Exclusive provision of public housing, social housing and cost rental housing on public lands.6. Prioritise urban renewal in line with a ‘town centre first’ model.7. A deep retrofit programme as part of a programme for8. A new social contract.9. Ending the direct provision system and replace it with accommodation provided by approved housing bodies.10. Commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas development aid.11. Development of a national land use plan.12. At least 20 per cent of transport spending on cycling and walking, and two-thirds of remaining budget on public transport.13. Trial universal basic income (UBI) within the lifetime of the government.14. Revision of National Development Plan to meet new climate targets and social policy goals.15.Review of the Government and Oireachtas response to the Covid-19 crisis.16.

File photograph: Getty ImagesCould a drug discovered in the 1970s help to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic? New evidence from research in Australia shows that the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin can inhibit the virus that causes Covid-19 from replicating in cells in the lab.While findings show promise, the news should be greeted with caveats, according to Donegal scientist Professor William C. Campbell, who shared a Nobel Prize for his role in the discovery of ivermectin.“The report is, in itself, of great importance,” says Prof Campbell of the study, which was carried out by scientists at Monash University in Melbourne. “But perspective is needed, even though perspective can be boring when the results are exciting.”The researchers in Melbourne grew mammalian cells in the lab and infected them with the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Then they exposed the cells and viruses in the lab to ivermectin, a drug that has been widely used for decades to control parasitic worms and insects in livestock, pets and humans.One of the best known uses of ivermectin in humans is against the worm that causes river blindness - the pharmaceutical company Merck donated the drug for that use for millions of people in affected areas.Prof Campbell, a graduate of Trinity College Dublin, shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 for his part in the discovery and development of ivermectin and its use in treating river blindness.While he was working at Merck Research Laboratories in New Jersey, he was part of an extensive team that identified a substance called avermectin, which was produced by bacteria and could stop parasitic worm infections.The compound was enhanced and developed as ivermectin, becoming a treatment for parasitic diseases such as heart worm in dogs and river blindness in humans. The Royal Irish Academy will publish Campbell’s memoir this June.While ivermectin has not been approved as a drug against viruses, it is known to be effective in the lab against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue and Influenza.The Australian research showed that ivermectin resulted in a 5,000-fold reduction of Sars-CoV-2 RNA within 48 hours. “Ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans,” explains the study authors in the journal ‘Antiviral Reports’.The experiments used high concentrations of ivermectin, notes Proff Campbell: “the concentration of drug needed to kill the virus in the lab was many times higher than the concentration of ivermectin found in the blood of people in the normal use of ivermectin to control parasitic disease.“So the probability of ivermectin being used safely to kill the virus in people must be considered low,” he says.“On the other hand, there is, as the authors of the report point out, the possibility that a safe dosage of ivermectin might reduce the rate of viral replication in the mammalian body, or affect the virus in other ways that might be revealed by further research. That is a more positive prospect.”Commenting on the study, lead researcher Dr Kylie Wagstaff from the Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University says: “Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that’s the next step.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4236266.1587655966!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 china to donate additional 28m to who","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDirector General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Photograph: Denis BalibouseReutersChina announced on Thursday it would donate an additional $30 million (€27.7 million) to the World Health Organisation to support the global battle against Covid-19, a move that comes days after Washington accused the health body of mismanaging the crisis and said it would freeze its funding.With tensions rising between the US and China over the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the financial support was “defending the ideals and principles of multilateralism and upholding the status and authority of the United Nations”.The contribution, which is in addition to $20 million (€18m) pledged last month, would be used to support health systems in developing countries, he said.Historically the US is a significantly larger donor to the WHO – Washington contributed $896 million in 2018, while Beijing gave $86 million – but last week US president Donald Trump suspended funding and accused the Geneva-based organisation of “disinformation” and being “very China-centric”.He claimed the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed the lives of more than 184,000 globally, could have been contained with “very little death” had China been more transparent and had the WHO assessed the early situation accurately.Mr Trump had originally disagreed with widespread criticisms of China and consistently praised Beijing’s performance, but with US infections soaring he shifted his stance at a press briefing on March 22nd.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that China “didn’t share all the information that it had and instead covered up how dangerous the disease was. It didn’t report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month” until it had spread to every province in China.In its monitoring of the situation in China in the early phases, Mr Pompeo said that the WHO had “clearly failed during this pandemic”.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday he hoped the Trump administration would reconsider the funding decision. “I hope the US believes that this is an important investment, not just to help others but for the US to stay safe also,” he said.Mr Trump said a decision on resuming funding would be made after a government investigation into the WHO’s response to the outbreak.On Thursday, the Chinese foreign ministry criticised a lawsuit by the state of Missouri that seeks damages from China over its handling of the outbreak. The “vexatious litigation” was “absurd and has no factual and legal basis”, a spokesman said.In an editorial on Thursday the state-run Global Times newspaper said that in response to the suit China needed to “enhance its countermeasures against US hooliganism”, which had now expanded into the judicial realm.“If Washington goes beyond verbal attacks and takes concrete actions to provoke China, China must firmly strike back, to prove that it cannot be bullied,” the editorial said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea step by step diary country got coronavirus control","story":"South Korea has been praised as a global leader in the fight against the coronavirus after quickly adopting an aggressive “trace, test, treat” policy.Nearly 120 countries have reached out to Seoul for advice as of the end of last month.The country’s first case was reported on January 20, compared with Italy’s on January 31, but the disease’s trajectory in the two nations could not look more different.South Korea has seen just 10,702 cases and 240 fatalities. A mass testing campaign, coupled with intensive contact tracing, has allowed the infected to quickly isolate, slowing the spread of the disease to make it more manageable for hospitals.Daily life is relatively normal, in contrast to the devastating pile up of coffins in quarantined Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Korean coronavirus test makers have started ramping up test-kit production to hundreds of thousands a day after being granted approval to export to the United States. NHS Scotland is also set to benefit from South Korean equipment that will give test results in just seven hours.Here\u0027s how South Korea\u0027s policy played out. Ben Griffin from Bradford, who teaches English in the small city of Gyeongju, experienced the efficiency of the Korean testing system, which had tested nearly 400,000 people in a country of 51.5 million by late March.When he arrived for a routine check-up at a hospital in the southern city of Busan he was stopped in the carpark for a temperature test and a health survey about his travel history and possible Covid-19 symptoms.His temperature was slightly above normal so he was not allowed inside, but was given the option of a test. The test is free for suspected Covid-19 cases but Mr Griffin used his health insurance to take a precautionary screening, for the cost of about £80.“Questionnaires are filled out in marquee tents outside the hospital. Then I got taken into another sealed off tent where there were people wearing hazmat suits,” he said.“It was basically just two tests – an extended cotton bud up the nose which makes your eyes water and then a thing down the throat which makes you gag a little bit but they were both done in 45 seconds,” he added“I got the test done about 4pm on the Friday and I knew by 11am on Saturday that I was negative.”Tracing is another essential part of the Korean system. Mr Griffin and his wife Cat said their phones regularly pinged with geolocated emergency alerts sent automatically by text message to indicate if someone nearby had tested positive.The alert gives details of where the patient has been in the last 72 hours, urging people who were in the same location to contact the health authorities.The alert conceals names but often gives details of age, where the patient lives or their job.“There was a case in our apartment building. We weren’t told who it was but there was an emergency alert and our security guards warned over the tannoy not to go outside,” said Mr Griffin.Hyun Park, a Korean professor who is still recovering from the disease but who described his treatment in a lengthy Facebook post, said he had been “stupidly overconfident” as he was a healthy gym fanatic who always washed his hands.Mr Park’s symptoms began with a very mild sore throat, dry cough and pressure on his chest. As his condition worsened, he called the coronavirus emergency line and the local health centre and was advised to take a test at the hospital. The result took 24 hours and was positive.An employee from the city hall called Mr Park to check recently visited areas and to list close contact.Mr Park said the city hall employee called a health centre to prioritise a transfer to hospital.I was hospitalised at the negative pressure room at the quarantined section of an intensive care unit,” he said.“They immediately took CT, blood, X-ray and many other tests and also immediately provided medicine and an oxygen supply,” he added.“I felt a better able to breathe, but like I had a heavy metal plate on my chest. My chest and stomach burned after taking the medicine.”South Korea has 10.6 intensive care beds per 100,000 compared to the UK’s 6.6, but as cases exploded in February, health facilities were initially overwhelmed, with hospitalisations peaking at over 5,000 in Daegu, the epicentre, in early March.The country turned the situation around by admitting only the most sick and elderly to hospitals, while isolating younger and asymptomatic patients in quarantine dormitories.Aggressive testing eventually curbed the spread and led to less pressure on the health system.Mr Park remained in hospital for nine days before being cleared by two negative tests.He was advised to remain in home quarantine for another two weeks and thanked “selfless” medics for their “hard and risky” work.After 25 days, he still feels short of breath after five minutes of walking, but is trying to keep his spirits up.“While there is life, there is hope,” he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK death toll increases by 616 as WHO warns half of all fatalities are in care homesThese are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusPolitics latest news: Nicola Sturgeon goes it alone with plan to lift Scottish lockdownComment: Trump\u0026#39s coronavirus response has been horrendous, while the UK is reassuringly grown-upGallery attendant shortlisted for BP Portrait Award Children abused in custody had \u0026#34nowhere to run\u0026#34 to escape extreme violence, report findsNot being able to make plans is biggest worry of lockdown BritainComment: Coronavirus has not wiped out wokeness, but at least kept it at bay New Queen Elizabeth aircraft carriers seen as \u0026#39vanity project\u0026#39, says former head of ArmyNicola Sturgeon warns UK faces multiple and sudden lockdowns as she outlines Covid-19 exit strategyRamadan 2020: fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranSt George\u0026#39s Day 2020: how the dragon-slayer became the patron saint of EnglandHow many coronavirus cases are in your area?

Instead of enjoying the new pleasure of silence and the new experience of unpolluted fresh air, we are bombarded by the noise and pollution of HMS Prince of Wales.The warship, which cost £3.1 billion to bring into service, boasts four Wärtsilä diesel generators, which each produces a total of 11 Megawatts of power – enough to sustain a town with a population of 25,000 people.The noise is the inevitable consequence of Portsmouth being the home of the Royal Navy, and having Britain’s two new aircraft carriers alongside at the same time will not often be the case.Similar complaints were made when the Type-45 Destroyers replaced the smaller Type-23s a few years ago.Local councillor Dawn Kelly has called on the navy to look at the noise problem, saying she can hear it from her home.She added: For those living in Clarence Yard the sound must be even louder as it gets reverberated around the square there.So I do think the residents have a valid complaint and I have urged them to approach environmental health.If the navy could do something to quieten the noise from the ship, that would be very welcome.It is Royal Navy policy to provide shore power to all vessels alongside whenever possible.An MoD spokesman told the : “We have got to make the ships habitable. They are the sailors\u0027 homes and the only place many have got to go, particularly among the junior ranks who are unmarried and so do not live in quarters. “That situation has been exacerbated by the requirements for social distancing which means unmarried sailors have been unable to return to their family homes.”Food still needs to be cooked and water pumps are required for showers all of which require power, the spokesman added. HMS Prince of Wales, which launched in December 2017, and her sister ship HMS Queen Elizabeth are the most powerful warships ever constructed in the UK.Each has two 33-tonne propellers which produce enough power to run 1,000 family cars, or 50 high speed trains.The 919ft carriers, designed to carry 36 fighter planes and four helicopters, can be put into action for work such as high-intensity war fighting or providing humanitarian aid and disaster relief.In December 2019, the Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla attended an official commissioning ceremony to formally welcome the aircraft carrier into the Royal Navy.A Royal Navy spokesman said: The carriers and the power plant remain on initial trials, and there will be occasions when the ships will need to use their own generators.These periods are always for the minimum amount of time necessary.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second coronavirus peak horizon means uks exit strategy","story":"In a press conference beamed across the nation on March 12, a bullish Boris Johnson announced that the Government\u0027s coronavirus strategy was to flatten the peak of cases – or, in the Prime Minister\u0027s more flamboyant words – to squash the sombrero.The goal, Mr Johnson explained, was not to suppress the virus entirely, but to keep infections at a lowish level to avoid overwhelming health services and prevent a deadly second wave.At that point, just eight people had died in Britain from the virus out of the 590 who had tested positive. Lockdown was more than 10 days away, and the Government was still hoping herd immunity could be achieved. A day after the press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, gave a television interview suggesting 60 per cent of people would need to become infected to protect the population. Yet after Imperial College modelling suggested such a mitigation strategy could result in 250,000 deaths, the Government made a rapid volte face, imposing strict social distancing measures and closing businesses and schools on March 23.The impact of such extreme suppression means a second peak, far higher than the first, is now a near certainty – and that has major implications for how Britain must exit the lockdown if such a catastrophe is to be avoided.  Here is what we know about a second wave and how it impacts the future:In the first graphs shown by Mr Johnson in March, squashing the sombrero would cause the first peak to come towards the end of May. The rounded peak appeared to be about half the size of that expected if the disease was left to run rampant through the population.Under that scenario, the NHS would be able to cope and the virus would not present a problem later in the year. Sir Patrick told journalists: We want to… not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.However, under the current suppression plan, the trajectory of the disease has changed dramatically, with the peak moving to the middle of December. Alarmingly, it appears every bit as high and deadly as the unmitigated wave the Government was so keen to avoid. Although experts believe we have now peaked in the first wave, that is actually only a very low level of what could happen if lockdown is lifted without any means to suppress a second, far more deadly wave. Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College, who led the modelling and sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said: There is almost no herd immunity and a very large risk of a second peak if we relax current measures without something to put in their place.One of the problems of Britain\u0027s lockdown strategy is just how effective it has been. Suppression modelling was based on all households reducing contact outside the household, school or workplace by up to 75 per cent. Workplace contact rates were to reduce by 25 per cent. On April 13, the Government released its first graphs showing how the public was complying with the lockdown. Workplaces were down 54 per cent, and retail and recreation down 85 per cent.Likewise, people appear to be doing better at self-isolating than was expected. It was assumed that just 70 per cent of people with symptoms of coronavirus would stay at home as instructed, but research by health experts Evergreen Life showed that, in most areas of Britain, more than 90 per cent are complying and even in the worst areas 75 per cent are still staying put.Although the modelling predicted that all schools would shut, it assumed 25 per cent of universities would remain open.Data published by the Department for Education this week showed that less than one per cent of children are going to school every day despite estimates from ministers that the amount would be up to 20 per cent. Likewise, it was thought that 50 per cent of people diagnosed with coronavirus would stay in quarantine for 14 days. Yet there is little evidence of people breaking quarantine, and powers of arrest have now been given to police to stop it from happening.A small study from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found people had cut contacts by around 73 per cent, roughly in line with Government expectations.While such compliance has been excellent at keeping the virus under control, leading to a noticeable downturn in cases in the past week, it means few people are building up immunity.In the critical Imperial Paper, published on March 16, scientists warned that once restrictions were relaxed infections would inevitably begin to rise again and the bounce-back would be far worse if suppression was too extreme.The more successful a strategy is at temporary suppression, the larger the later epidemic is predicted to be, in the absence of vaccination, due to lesser build-up of herd immunity, the researchers warned.Experts on the Government\u0027s Sage committee now believe that only about five per cent of the population has been infected with the disease and that there is almost no herd immunity in Britain.Under the Government’s mitigation strategy, the reproduction, or R number, would reduce dramatically, but not to below one, so cases would rise, but only slowly, until hitting a peak.Under the suppression strategy, the reproduction rate falls from around 2.6 to below one and the virus dies away. But reducing infections now can store up problems for the future. The Government is carrying out a testing programme to determine how many people in Britain have recovered from the disease and work out current immunity level, but so far it has not published the findings.Several studies have now put it at roughly six per cent, and new results this week from the The Pasteur Institute show just 5.7 per cent of people in France will have contracted coronavirus by the time the country starts lifting lockdown next month.The institute researchers warned of the high risk of a second wave unless drastic social distancing is maintained.Karol Skiora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, has been carrying out his own antibody testing and believes that between eight to 10 per cent of people are likely to have had coronavirus so far. We\u0027re nowhere near herd immunity, he said. We could definitely have a second peak. You look at countries like Austria where they have opened their garden centres and small shops a week ago and they seem to have more cases again, so it is a real worry.Imperial College predicted that strict lockdown measures would be needed for at least five months, but also warned that restrictions and widespread monitoring would have to stay in place until a vaccine was available in order to prevent a second wave. Dozens of research labs across the globe are working on vaccines and a team at Oxford believe they could have a viable jab ready by the autumn. Yet scaling up will present a problem and it is likely that only frontline workers will be given vaccines initially, leaving the general public waiting until at least next year. That delay means restrictions such as social distancing will be in place for many months to come. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the Sage group and the director of the Wellcome Trust, said the virus would not be going away any time soon and future waves were likely.We must assume and prepare for the fact that this is not a discrete one-off episode, he said. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection. It is likely that this is here with the human race for the future. We\u0027re going to have to find ways to deal with that.The real moving forward is we have to have new tests, we have to have drugs that treat this infection, and critically we need to have vaccines so we can prevent what we should assume are future waves.In recent weeks, journalists have questioned why the Government is continuing to invest in huge numbers of intensive care beds at Nightingale hospitals while cases are on the decline.The possibility of a second peak is likely to be the reason.While the current epidemic appears to have stabilised below 1,000 cases a day, modelling of a second wave suggests that it could be far higher if it is not brought under control through mass testing, contact tracing and isolation after lockdown.Asked whether the Nightingale hospitals were being kept for a possible second wave, a Downing Street spokesman said: I am certainly not aware of any plans to stand down these Nightingale hospitals, and some are still being built.Fears of a second coronavirus wave have made governments around the world nervous about lifting their lockdowns too early and too quickly, and Britain is no exception.A safety net of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation of those infected must be in place to ensure cases are not allowed to rise, while squashing the sombrero of a second peak may now be a viable option.Ilan Kelman, professor of disasters and health at University College London said: A second peak of infection could be manageable if we protect those who are vulnerable, treat those who get sick, do not reduce other medical services and meet all healthcare worker needs. Another possible strategy is a staged stand-down of lockdown to flatten a second peak, provided that those who are told to remain in lockdown, or who cannot work because of it, are given all the support they need to avoid difficult effects of being isolated while others resume life.In China, a spike in infections after weeks of falling rates has forced the authorities to impose new restrictions.In the north-eastern city of Harbin, a 22-year-old university student who returned from the US was identified as the source of more than 40 new infections, while Chinese citizens returning from Siberia via the border town of Suifenhe led to more than 400 confirmed new cases.The examples show the huge problem in restarting life again after a strict lockdown when so few of the population are immune. In Germany, credited with keeping its outbreak under tight control through its use of extensive testing and contact tracing, there has been a rise in deaths as the country was re-opening some small shops and preparing for children to return to school from May 4.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that any second wave of coronavirus was likely to be even more serious if it coincided with the start of flu season.Robert Redfield told The Washington Post: There\u0027s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up pink flamingos flock","story":"Ask anyone to name the most festive of all the wading birds. If they fail to answer that question with “flamingo” they’ve made a terrible mistake.We’ve written before about the upside of humans doing far less human stuff in these locked-down times, and there’s a similar report coming out of Albania this morning which ticks all the boxes.Pink flamingos and something called curly pelicans are thriving thanks to the quietness of lagoons around the country’s western coastline.Numbers are up by almost a third on normal, and as these photos show we are approaching \u0027kitschy Hitchcock remake\u0027 levels of birds on the undisturbed waters:Still curious about those curly pelicans, though.

You see, it celebrates that shameful identity, Englishness, which represents everything that internationalist progressives despise. Apparently, it’s all empire, queen and country, village greens, afternoon tea, Captain Mainwaring and they don’t like it up ‘em.Scottishness is to be applauded, of course, Welshness is noble, and Irishness a privilege. No, it’s just Englishness that must be discouraged – it’s a nasty, embarrassing habit that you should grow out of. Feel free, of course, to celebrate your town, county, region, Britain, Europe, and planet Earth in general. But England? Move along, please.Even in normal times St George’s Day comes and goes with barely a whisper of official recognition. And this year, that whisper might well descend into dismissive silence. We can’t think about St George’s Day in the midst of a crisis, can we? We mustn’t encourage people to celebrate England, of all places, when people are dying.Well, I beg to differ. If there’s one thing Covid-19 has shown us, it is that nations have acted to protect people, and it is nations in which we have placed our faith. Just look at the EU, that delusion of solidarity and ever-closer union, which watched in dumbstruck bewilderment as its 27 constituent parts rushed to close borders and look after number one. But lest anyone one should forget, England is a nation too, though it continues to be denied its own government, assembly, anthem and other symbols that other countries take for granted. So, while Nicola Sturgeon gives the Scottish response to Covid-19, Arlene Foster the Northern Irish response, and Mark Drakeford the Welsh, who speaks just for England? Nobody. The West Lothian Question is still alive and kicking England in the face, 43 years after it was first asked.Yet England is suffering from Covid-19 far more than any other part of the UK, with the official death rate twice as high as in Scotland, and close to being the highest in the world. Which is no surprise, given that England is just about the most densely populated country in Europe (equally crowded Belgium also has a high Covid-19 death rate). Crowded countries not only mean more readily transmitted viruses, but smaller homes and less outdoor space, making the lockdown even more torturous than for those living in, say, relatively spacious Ireland. It’s England’s double Coronavirus whammy.Thank goodness, then, the nation is pulling together to face down this foul foe, and English people, young and old, should be proud of their compatriots for rallying to the cause. This means it’s no time to abandon St George’s Day. Far from it. It is time to be doubly thankful for nationhood. Alright, it will never be the English way, even in normal years, to get all demonstrative and weepy, and drape ourselves in the flag. We leave that to others. But we are capable of coming out of our shells, just a little, just occasionally.And we can do so today. At 8pm many of us will be joining the now familiar clap for our carers. This week, on St George’s Day, my hope is that we can give an extra-loud clap, not just for carers throughout the UK, but for England’s carers in particular, and for England’s NHS, which has borne the brunt of the ghastly business.And I, for one, will be cheering the selfless response from people up and down England who have sacrificed freedom, largely without complaint, and cooped themselves up in often tiny living spaces, seeking to protect others. Here’s to you.If the cynics want to dismiss Englishness as being more about Dad’s Army than anything woke and modern, then so be it. Let them.

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe added: “I think you have to look at the totality of what we are offering ...\u0026nbspif you look at what the Swiss are offering in terms of fiscal stimulus, as I understand the majority of it has gone through these particular loan schemes.”Mr Sharma conceded that there was a need to “get more loans out there” but said that the number of accredited lenders had increased to 48 with the addition of peer-to-peer platforms like Funding Circle.Businesses demand more help from banks during Covid-19 pandemicFigures released on Thursday by banking trade body UK Finance show that 16,624 of the 36,186 small business finance applications for CBILS facility have been processed and approved. The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Larger firms have received £11.2bn through a credit facility with the Bank of England while 500,000 SMEs have had grants totalling £6bn, Mr Sharma said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHe added: “I think you have to look at the totality of what we are offering ...\u0026nbspif you look at what the Swiss are offering in terms of fiscal stimulus, as I understand the majority of it has gone through these particular loan schemes.”Mr Sharma conceded that there was a need to “get more loans out there” but said that the number of accredited lenders had increased to 48 with the addition of peer-to-peer platforms like Funding Circle.Businesses demand more help from banks during Covid-19 pandemicFigures released on Thursday by banking trade body UK Finance show that 16,624 of the 36,186 small business finance applications for CBILS facility have been processed and approved. The average value of a CBILS loan stands at £171,000. Business groups say that is not enough and are calling for urgent changes to the scheme.Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “It is positive to see the scheme ramping up, but cash still needs to get to more businesses quickly. Reforms have started to bed in, and more money is getting out the door. However, there are still swathes of businesses facing processing delays and restrictive viability criteria, and many are reluctant to engage with the system at all.”He urged the government to relax affordability criteria for small loans and to increase state backing for lenders’ losses.Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry called on banks to consider firms at the heart of communities such as small shops, restaurants, gyms, manufacturers and mechanics, many of whom are looking for relatively small loans.“These figures mark an improvement,” Mr Cherry said. “But we need to see far more from the banks where the speed of processing applications and making money available to the smallest businesses are concerned.“The government should up its guarantee on emergency loans with values under £30,000 from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. That, combined with the streamlined application process that should be in place for facilities of this size, should help to get more cash to the small firms that really need it.”Part of the problem is that while the government is backing up to 80 per cent of banks’ losses on the loans, that still leaves them on the hook for 20 per cent. Given the potential size of the scheme, that represents a risk that some lenders appear reluctant to take.Banks may also need to change some of their operations to allow them to approve commercial loans under £25,000 because of consumer credit rules.Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey suggested last week that the government should look at guaranteeing business loans under £25,000 so that banks can avoid carrying out standard credit checks that have blocked some applications.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTreasury officials are understood to be concerned about potential abuse of the system if guarantees are increased to 100 per cent. But those fears must be weighed against the danger of exacerbating economic damage caused by the pandemic if thousands of businesses run out of cash and go bust.Mr Sharma also said he would look to introduce measures to ease commercial rent demand within the next week.“I do think the majority of landlords and tenants are working well, they are reaching agreements on debt obligations but I am certainly aware that certain landlords are putting undue financial pressure with aggressive debt recovery tactics,” he said.“What I’m very happy to say to you is I will look to introduce temporary measures on this particular issue which will ease commercial rent demand and protect the UK high street ... that is something I will be doing very very shortly.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Their unusual formation has been described by astronomers as a string of bright pearls and are clearly visible when they are angled in such a way that they reflect light from the Sun.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis could potentially cause disruption for optical telescopes and may even block sightings of Earth-bound asteroids, according to some astronomers.We\u0027re fixing it now, Mr Musk tweeted following the latest launch. We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness... Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle and all satellites get sunshades starting with launch nine.To hide the satellites from ground-based observers,\u0026nbspSpaceX\u0026nbspwill paint the base of the satellites black. The company is also working with the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the European radio astronomy community in order to mitigate any impact on radio astronomy activities.The\u0026nbspStarlink\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbsphas already been tested by Mr Musk, who posted a tweet through it in November, but before it is made public later this year he\u0026nbspinvited people to attempt to hack the network.SpaceX\u0026nbsppreviously played down the risk of interference in astronomical observations posed by the Starlink satellites. Speaking at the Satellite 2020 conference in March, Mr Musk said that such concerns were being exaggerated.I am confident that we will not cause any impact whatsoever in astronomical discoveries, zero. That\u0027s my prediction, he said. We will take corrective action if it\u0027s above zero. I\u0027ve not met someone who can tell me where all of them are, so it can\u0027t be that big of a deal.Created with Sketch.Space as seen from a grandmother\u0027s garden Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Captured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean, this picture was named picture of the day by NASACaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean310 Horse Head and Flame NebulaeCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean Dean810 Bodes and Cigar GalaxiesCaptured from the back garden of Guernsey grandmother Jean DeanJean Dean with her Sky-Watcher ESPRIT 80ED telescopic cameraJean Dean at homeFollowing a launch of Starlink satellites last year, astronomers at\u0026nbspthe Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile reported disturbances with their observations.As the constellation of\u0026nbspStarlink\u0026nbspsatellites grows, and as more companies look to develop their own space-based\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspprojects, astronomers fear that the problem will not go away.An online petition calling for an end to the irresponsible practice of littering the night sky with bright low-orbit satellites has gathered more than 1,500 signatures.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t replace the people we lose,’ says retail bossCath Kidston permanently closed all of its stores with the loss of 900 jobs, while Primark\u0027s\u0026nbspowner said sales had fallen to zero and it had furloughed 68,000 staff on another ominous day for British retailers, who have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, pubs, bars and restaurants warned MPs that they face a “bloodbath” as lockdown conditions are eased, with up to a third of the sector at risk of going out of business.Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns budget retailer Primark, was the first to sound the alarm on Tuesday, as it revealed that sales had dropped from £650m per month to zero as a result of all its stores closing in Europe and the US.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUnlike many rivals, Primark does not sell clothes online\u0026nbsp— meaning it has been unable to mitigate lost revenues by ramping up deliveries to customers’ homes.ABF boss George Weston said the group had been “squarely in the path of this pandemic” and would have had to have laid off staff if governments had not implemented furlough schemes which cover wage costs.Pre-tax profits slumped 42 per cent to £298m for the half-year to February as Primark was left with millions of pounds of stock it was unable to sell. The company wrote down the value of its stock by £243m.Mr Weston said that when stores can reopen, “we must make our Primark stores safe for our staff and our customers, even if that means ensuring there are fewer people shopping at any one time and so accepting lower sales at least until the remaining risk is minimal”.“In time we can rebuild the profits. We can’t replace the people we lose.”Home furnishings chain Cath Kidston confirmed on Tuesday that its 60 stores will not reopen after the coronavirus lockdown ends, with just 32 out of 940 employees to keep their jobs.The brand will continue after a deal with the one of the retailer’s shareholders, Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA), which will buy the online business, brand and wholesale arm from administrators Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal.With unemployment set to soar, the government needs a ‘Cobra for jobs’Melinda Paraie, chief executive officer of Cath Kidston, said: “While we are pleased that the future of Cath Kidston has been secured, this is obviously an extremely difficult day as we say goodbye to many colleagues.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is no suggestion that Mr Christodolou knew about the contents of the letter.Last month, the government suspended all eviction proceedings for 90 days as part of emergency measures to protect renters, but campaigners argue further action is needed.Under the temporary rules, tenants can also ask their landlord for a rent repayment holiday if they are struggling to pay, although they will have to make up the arrears after the period of national emergency is over.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The current crisis has brought these issues into stark relief.“With millions of low-paid renters in London now facing increased financial uncertainty we face a ticking timebomb of debt, arrears and widespread evictions once the suspension in court proceedings is lifted.”Landlords welcomed the proposal to increase public funding to cover tenants’ rent payments.\u0026nbspBen Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said the group supported an increase in the housing allowance.Future of UK shopping centres in doubt as retailers stop paying rentHe added: “In addition, we repeat our call on the Government to scrap the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit immediately and ensure tenants can have the housing element of the credit paid directly to their landlord if they wish.”Private landlords received £23bn of public money through housing benefit payments last year, money that critics argue would be better spent on ending a chronic undersupply of social and affordable housing.The Money Advice Trust, a charity that runs the National Debtline, is calling for holidays for council tax bills, which, along with rent, are among the most common reasons for people to fall into debt.“People struggling with council tax bills, self-employed people facing immediate hardship, and private renters are particularly at risk of falling into serious financial difficulty,” said Joanna Elson, the charity’s chief executive.“The government must take urgent action to close the gaps in its Covid-19 financial support package, or many more households will fall into problem debt.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some have done so openly - Uniqlo boasted in an advertisement that cotton from the province, used in its shirts, was “famous for its superb quality”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYet the UN also believes Xinjiang to be the site of potential systemic human rights abuses against Muslim minorities. Since 2017, China is widely reported to have detained more than a million - some estimates put\u0026nbsp the figure at three million - Uighur Muslims in detention facilities that Beijing has dubbed vocational training centres.The Chinese government insists the centres are voluntary, and a necessary step to quell a violent Islamist insurgency in the country’s north-west. But rights groups say those who “graduate” from such centres are being shifted into factories as part of a central government scheme, made to live in on-site dormitories under 24-hour supervision and refused permission to return to their own homes.For this Uighur escapee, reuniting with family could be impossibleUighur Muslims \u0027sent to work in Chinese factory that supplies Nike\u0027China’s Uighur Muslims ‘detained for growing beards’ Uighur town clings to cultural past in spite of China effortsCotton is big business for China. The country provides between a fifth and a quarter of all global supplies, and of that 84 per cent comes from Xinjiang, according to a report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.In writing their letter to the UK’s customs authorities, the World Uighur Congress (WUC) and the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) argued that current cotton imports from China “involve forced labour on such a scale that they violate a number of UK laws, including 19th century legislation prohibiting the importation of prison-made goods, and should be halted”.The letter also argues that by allowing the import of cotton from Xinjiang, a region witnessing what the authors call “the largest mass detention of an ethnic group since the Second World War”, the UK government may be guilt of “conduct ancillary to crimes against humanity”.“But because they are a public body, all their actions are subject to judicial review by the High Court. So while - given the UK’s approach to this date - we’re really hoping they will willingly take up the issue, it does lay out the basis for a potential case later on down the line if that was necessary.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was announced, coincidentally, the day after the publication of a major Wall Street Journal investigation focusing on conditions for workers at a mill in Xinjiang supplying several international retailers. The retailer continues to offer “Xinjiang Cotton” branded products on its website today.Rahima Mahmut, the UK project director for the World Uighur Congress and a UK resident, said the persecution of minority Muslims in Xinjiang since 201617 had been “almost a genocide”.“I lost contact with my entire family since January 2017, and all the Uighurs like myself living in exile are living in hell, not knowing what happened,” she told The Independent.“Since the harvest from the cotton season 2020-21 will not be approved by BCI, Ikea has taken the decision to stop sourcing cotton from Xinjiang, China,” the spokesperson said. “We want to create a positive impact in the world of cotton, and we know that with our size and volumes, we have the possibility to make a difference. Ikea will continue to work towards improving the cotton industry from within and create a movement towards better cotton and better working conditions for those working in the industry.”H\u0026ampM likewise admitted that “up until now, our suppliers have sourced cotton from farms connected to BCI in the region” (Xinjiang).Created with Sketch.

This means that for our production, the suppliers we work with will not buy BCI cotton from Xinjiang for the coming season,” a spokesperson said.“Considering the complexity of the situation, we are in close contact with human rights experts, other brands, and stakeholders, to evaluate how we can further strengthen our due diligence and responsibly address the situation and in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles.”A spokesperson for Uniqlo\u0026nbspsaid the company was\u0026nbspdeeply troubled by reports and articles raising serious concerns on the situation for Uighurs in China.Uniqlo said its production partners\u0026nbspmust commit to our strict company code of conduct, which covers human and worker rights. Through mechanisms Uniqlo has in place to identify potential violations of human and worker rights, we have not learned of any of the issues raised in past reports or articles.We continue to communicate with our production partners about the workforce in their supply chains, in order to ensure our products are being produced in ethical environments.Muji did not respond to a request\u0026nbspfor comment before publication.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for Ryohin Keikaku, Muji\u0027s parent company, told Australia’s ABC News late last year that Xinjiang was “one of the world\u0027s finest cotton-producing areas”.“We do not disclose any names of suppliers,” the spokesperson said. “However, in response to the recent inquiries, we have started conducting a review of the situation in the Xinjiang area for farms that cultivate cotton as well as spinning factories that produce yarn — the products of which are applied in our cotton products. We will announce the results of the review when necessary.” It is unclear whether that review has been completed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Members of the public should refrain from wearing such masks, but are free to wear a scarf or homemade mask.Current advice by Public Health England (PHE) recommends masks for NHS staff and social care workers but does not suggest other people wear them outside.Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, said there has been no new decision on the matter ahead of the SAGE meeting today.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We know in some cases it’s their only main meal for the day and they’re not able to get much else.How to support our campaign“I am seeing some scared elderly people on their own, so if I speak to them from the pavement, I’m just trying to reassure them and keep their spirits up,” he adds.Briana LeBold, 47, works in fashion production and was furloughed by her company soon after the lockdown began. She has been volunteering as a food delivery cyclist a few days a week.“I decided worrying about work isn’t going to change anything,” she says. “I thought what Made in Hackney and some of the food charities were doing was wonderful, so I just wanted to get involved to support the work.“There isn’t a huge amount of interaction with people, obviously, but they do let us know how much they’re enjoying the meals. Even if it’s just a wave and a ‘hi’ – it’s still really nice to see people and feel like you’re helping in some way.”Tais Lima, a 41-year-old yoga teacher, is volunteering one day a week. “I like getting out on my bike with a sense of purpose,” she says. “There’s a lot of lonely and vulnerable people out there, but it’s rewarding to see they’re getting a meal that changes their day.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her staff identified 420 iniduals and families in the London borough in dire need of food each day, and asked for volunteers to help drop off the vegan meals between 2pm and 6pm every afternoon.Kitchen staff at the Angelina restaurant in Dalston have helped with the cooking so they can meet a target of delivering 30,000 meals over the next three months.“We knew there was going to be this incredible level of need out there, so we ripped up our job descriptions and threw ourselves into this work,” says Ms Bentley. “It’s been pretty emotional at times, pretty intense to see what people are going through. We want to be able to help more people if we possibly can.”She told The Independent how one family had no food at all in the house for more than two days before they began getting daily meals out to them.One of those receiving a delivery each afternoon is David Pavlovic, a 63-year-old with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease, who was told not to leave home for a 12-week period.“I’ve got family outside of London and friends across the city – but they have problems of their own with job losses,” he says.“I did get worried for a while about having enough food, so it was just a massive relief to get meals delivered. The charities like The Felix Project and Made in Hackney are doing really important work, and it seems like they enjoy doing it too.

He picked up a van at a depot in northwest London, drove more than 100 miles to pick up two tons of surplus food, returned to the depot to unload, and then headed back out across the capital to deliver fresh produce to hungry children and adults. He works a 65-hour week –\u0026nbspand has done so since the start of the coronavirus outbreak –\u0026nbspfor no pay.MacNichol is a volunteer for The Felix Project, our Help The Hungry appeal partner. Since lockdown, Felix has quadrupled food deliveries to vulnerable Londoners to a staggering 100,000 meals a day. But they have had to manage this with a small staff of 22 and a 30-fold reduction in volunteers – from 3,500 to just 115 – as many of their volunteers are over 70 and can no longer work due to Covid-19 restrictions.These super volunteers are the backbone for London’s fourth emergency service –\u0026nbspfood provision to the capital’s hungry –\u0026nbspand Felix could not function without them. Today we meet six of them and ask why they joined and what volunteering means to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHow to support our campaign“Going back 10 years, we were instructed by our bosses at Sainsbury’s to destroy all surplus food, but then the likes of Felix came along and suddenly there was no excuse for waste. I was so impressed by Felix’s operation that I promised to volunteer when I retired. Since coronavirus, I do a 65-hour week.

Later I deliver to community hubs, charities and schools that have set up food drop centres.“Recently I supplied a school in Ealing and as I arrived one boy said to his friend, “now we’ve got something to eat tonight”, and I thought, bloody hell.

I promised myself that one day I would go back and volunteer –\u0026nbspand that’s what I did last November. It was amazing to see how Felix had grown into a major lifeline for thousands of Londoners. I thought, incredible growth, incredible impact –\u0026nbspit really does walk the talk. In my job, I see the distress inequality causes, but when I go out in a Felix van, I feel I am doing something good for the community. It might sound schmaltzy but, for me, it’s my war effort.”Economics graduate, works for Cisco Systems“I started volunteering for Felix in January and the thing that struck me when I first walked into their Park Royal warehouse was the unbelievable quantity of food that would otherwise go to waste. It is such a bustling place and since coronavirus, it’s even busier because major suppliers like Hello Fresh and Sainsbury’s have even more surplus food. It’s a boost for my morale to help during lockdown and satisfying to see the smiles on people’s faces as you arrive in the green Felix van.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastLawyer and non-executive director of Investec Wealth“I joined Felix last year because my friend Gary had been there 18 months and loves it, so I went out in the van and got hooked.

Emphasising devotion while fasting and developing an affinity with fellow Muslims, this time would usually see gatherings at mosques, homes and out on\u0026nbspthe streets.But widespread restrictions have been implemented around the world, including a ban in Turkey on tents designed to offer\u0026nbspfree fast-breaking iftar dinners and pre-dawn suhoor meals. Citizens there are also forbidden\u0026nbspfrom tipping drummers walking through the streets to wake people for their last meal before dawn, with the country responding after nearly\u0026nbsp100,000 cases and 2,259 fatalities as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University.\u0026nbspCharity tables have also been barred in Egypt, though there have been just\u0026nbsp3,490 cases with\u0026nbspthe death total currently at 264.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSaudi Arabia has suspended visas for Muslims seeking to take pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina, while Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u0026nbspwas apologetic\u0026nbspafter\u0026nbspannouncing a ban on the country’s\u0026nbspusual ceremonies and forbidding the public from\u0026nbspattending holy shrines and mosques for two more weeks at least. Pakistan has walked back restrictions on\u0026nbspgroups of five or less able to\u0026nbspattend prayers at mosques though after\u0026nbspclashes between\u0026nbspworshipers and police.A sombre mood is likely to overshadow much of the month, though the nature of Islam could help Muslims cope better in these\u0026nbsptesting circumstances.“It’s going to be different and difficult in certain circumstances, but Islam is a very flexible religion, it covers for all circumstances, so the usual worship we would do in mosques, we can do them at home, there’s no harm in that given the situation,”\u0026nbspFarhad Ahmad, an Imam\u0026nbspat Fazl Mosque in London, tells The Independent.“During Ramadan we increase our worship, doing more goodness towards others, paying more to charity. So in a way, given everybody is now at home already, you’re self-isolating or in quarantine, that is sort of a natural phenomena that usually happens in Ramadan anyway, as people become more devout and less social anyway.“It’s a bit different to what some people think about Ramadan. Being forced into it is not the ideal situation, Ramadan doesn’t say don’t go to work or see your friends, but at the same time, there’s an emphasis to reflect on life, spend more time worshipping God, so this opportunity has made us more aware that we can do this more comfortably.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIndeed the practice of itikaf – solitary confinement during\u0026nbspthe final days of Ramadan in a mosque – means that many Muslims may be accustomed to their current circumstances, even if they are now at home rather than a place of worships. While many\u0026nbspmosques are now putting on\u0026nbsponline\u0026nbspexercise classes and lectures to the burden on people\u0026nbspduring this time.“Some people are going through a difficult time with anxiety, depression or mental health issues,” Mr Ahmad adds. “But if you’re unwell or ill, Islam says you’re not supposed to fast.

His government has “made mistakes” — and so has ours.But presidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates. When it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.It would take a very brave prime minister indeed to ignore the people appointed to safeguard the nation’s health when lives are at risk.And the advice from those experts — the sprawling Public Health England in particular — was that Britain faced no more than a larger-than-usual dose of winter flu.PHE was against German-style mass testing and, when caught flat-footed, rejected help from commercial laboratories in providing those tests.PHE failed to build stocks of personal protective equipment — including masks, gowns and gloves — despite a  test run showing these were a priority.PHE dragged its feet over sourcing ventilators for intensive-care patients and extra hospital beds.Frequently when running short of crucial gear, PHE resisted offers of outside help, leaving the NHS scrambling to catch up.And when it came to opening London’s ,-bed Nightingale emergency hospital, it was the Army that did the job in nine days.It was also PHE who insisted the British public would be protected by “herd immunity”.The sooner  per cent of the population had contracted the virus and become immune, the better, it said.Boris faithfully followed their lead until another expert, Prof Neil Ferguson, issued a nightmare prediction of , dead unless Britain was locked up overnight.It was Ferguson who in the Blair years forecast mass burials on the scale of the Great Plague during the “Mad Cow” scare and the foot-and-mouth outbreak.Neither Armageddon scenario came remotely close.Once this is over and the inevitable inquiry is held, Boris and his government will inevitably be in the dock.So will PHE, a fiercely territorial quango with a giant £.billion budget.Much of this goes on pay and perks for well-cushioned executives, with  staff on six-figure salaries — a nanny-state rich list.Its website boasts its job is to “protect and improve the nation’s health and wellbeing”.And yet this box-ticking bureaucracy — obsessed with sugary drinks and ersity — has failed at the first hurdle.It shares with the higher reaches of the NHS a suspicion of fleet-footed commercial rivals and deep-seated hostility to the “profit motive”.Criticism, still muted, is widespread within the medical community, including frontline doctors and consultants.Every Thursday at pm, a grateful nation stands and applauds NHS staff working around the clock to save lives at the risk of their own.The same cannot be said for the inflexible, politically correct quango that binds the hands of medical staff in the name of an outdated socialist credo on health provision: State good, private bad.Much will need to change after Covid-. And that change must start with Public Health England.MINISTERS are looking at a traffic-light system to lt lockdown. Red for Stop, green for Go, with amber in between.Overzealous cops and councils are being reined in. ­Common sense is taking over. Families can now attend funerals.We might be able to say goodbye to dying ­relatives. Parks will reopen to the ­public. Benches have been deemed safe to sit on.So how about allowing non-contact sporting activities that boost both physical and mental health Swimming pools are surely safe.

Do they really think that is the priority right now The Sussexes - from their Los Angeles bolthole - issued the tetchy statement saying they would no longer deal with The Sun and Britain’s other tabloid newspapers.It was reported on the front page of the republican sympathisingnewspaper.s story mentioned that the Sussexes were thought to be “angered” by a Sun exclusive that they were relocating to North America.That story was, of course, true.I fear Harry has already soaked up too much of the Hollywood “me, me, me” culture.He and Meghan appear to want to shape their media profile by press release and their own social media channels.That way they believe the coverage will be more glowing.It’s how celebrities try and control their public image.But I think British public will see through all that.I suggest the Sussexes time right now might be better spent writing letters to NHS workers and people who have lost loved ones to this awful virus.Or sending letters of comfort to those confined to their homes or the soldiers who have been helping Nightingale Hospitals across the country rather than whining about the media.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.If they need to see how it should be done they only need to look at the way the Queen, Charles and Camilla and William and Catherine have gone about things.They’ve shown resilience and leadership in these dark times.

On each phone there is an app that reports back to the authorities on the users’ health and online activities.Nor is there any escape in the home. The very concept of privacy barely exists when the state can use sophisticated technology to keep watch on our behaviour.This vision sounds like a nightmare, but it could become all too real thanks to the coronavirus.In its fallout, Covid- may end up causing as much damage to our essential freedoms as to our health # with the new menace of Big Brother on its way.Already the current emergency has led to the first comprehensive lockdown in British history.Evenit has been necessary to slow the spread of the virus, it is nevertheless a draconian measure that would have been unthinkable only a few weeks ago.Effectively the entire public has been placed under house arrest.Normal le has been brought juddering to a halt, while the police have been given unprecedented powers to enforce the quarantine.Even sitting for too long on a park bench or taking a leisurely drive have become offences against the state.With heroic stoicism, the vast majority of people have accepted this policy, seeing it as the only realistic means to protect the NHS and lessen the transmission of coronavirus.They hope that once the worst of the crisis has passed, there will be ato the Britain that they love, where inidual rights are respected and the power of the state is limited.Above all, this is my deepest wish too # though the chances look slim.One of the reasons why I, as an Irishman, admire this country so much is because of the British tradition of liberty, reflected in Magna Carta, parliamentary democracy and the defeat of Nazi tyranny.Unfortunately, even when the current lockdown is lted, it is possible that heavy-handed control by the state will remain.Quarantine may be temporary, but authoritarianism could be permanent.This is because officialdom, shaken by the unexpected scale of the coronavirus crisis, will be determined to prevent its resurgence by any means necessary.That will involve far more than just the maintenance of social distancing and the wearing of face masks.An arsenal of other measures could be deployed in the fight.One will be the reintroduction of curfews at the first sign of any new flare up in cases.If there is such a setback, the mood of the authorities will be even more intolerant towards any breaches. Fines will be heavier, jail terms longer.The skies will be filled with the sound of helicopters and the sight of drones as police — or even the Army — embark on ruthless enforcement.Another change is likely to be the advent of biometric identity cards, backed up by a comprehensive database of the entire population.Such a system has long been the dream of bureaucrats in Whitehall, and the aftermath of the crisis provides the perfect excuse for its imposition.Its appeal is all the greater because the latest type of cards operate with biotechnology that scans eyes and fingerprints.Only last year, the European Union passed a regulation requiring all national identity card systems on the continent to comply with new biometric standards.The British state will not stop there in its new crusade.In the name of health protection, mobile phone companies could be required to share data on their clients.According to the New Statesman, British Telecom, which owns the EE network, is already “in talks with the Government about handing over phone location and usage data” for the purpose of monitoring adherence to the lockdown.Similarly, tracking apps on devices could also be made obligatory so that the Government will be able to trace the contacts of anyone infected and ensure compliance with quarantine rules.Just as some criminals on release have to wear electronic tags, anyone who has tested positive for the virus may be ordered to wear a medical wristband even when self-isolation is over.Alternatively, those who test negative could be given immunity certicates.These initiatives will be accompanied by a political drive to reinforce support for the state, as happens in wartime.In a distinctly un-British way, people will be encouraged to snitch on those who fail to abide by the rules.Challenges to ruling orthodoxy will be seen as a form of subversion.If that sounds far-fetched, consider how laws to tackle discrimination or terrorism are now used to uphold fashionable ideology, as highlighted in the outrageous recent case where Lincolnshire businessman Harry Miller was questioned by police for allegedly sending a “transphobic” tweet.In the new Britain scarred by corona, the whole relationship between the state and the public will be inverted.The Government is meant to be accountable to the people.But, burdened with ID cards, curfews and tracking apps, the people will be accountable to the Government.There is an echo here of the George Orwell’s novel , which painted a terrying picture of Britain under totalitarian rule.In Orwell’s society gripped by permanent crisis, the citizenry were monitored day and night by the state.The propaganda and all-seeing eye of Big Brother could never be avoided, “always watching and the voice enveloping you, asleep or awake, indoors or outdoors, in the bath or in bed#.In the present global crisis, many look to the experience of Asia, which has had far lower Covid death rates than the West.But that is a dangerous stance. First it ignores the fundamental point that China is responsible for the spread of this disease through its cover-up, persecution and lies.The country should be in the dock, not garnered with praise.Second it glosses over the oppressive nature of many of these Asian regimes, particularly that run by the tyrannical Chinese communist party.China has eagerly embraced new technology, like tracking devices, facial recognition cameras, eye-scanning security barriers and online data gathering, precisely because they drastically enhance the power of the state machine.Indeed, the country likes to boast that it is building the “world’s largest camera surveillance network”.As an example, in Guangzhou province, the commercial hub of southern China, tablets have been recently installed on buses to promote safety.Passengers are expected to lean their foreheads close to the tablet so that their photos and temperatures can be taken.China is also establishing a sinister “social credit system”, where behaviour is monitored to assess a citizen’s trustworthiness.Those given high ratings by the state can receive rewards like employment offers, shorter waiting times in hospitals and discounts at hotels.It is a recipe for bureaucratic despotism and political infantilisation.Other Asian nations, while nothing like as cruel as China, are also using technology as a tool to corral their public.Hong Kong has introduced mandatory wristbands for those in quarantine so they can be tracked.Taiwan has a monitoring system known as “the electronic fence” where those who are meant to be in isolation will be visited by the authoritiesthey turn off their mobiles.In South Korea, the government gathers huge amounts of data from phone records, CCTV images, and credit cards to help track citizens during the Covid crisis, while in Singapore, phone users are encouraged to download the “TraceTogether” app.This keeps a record of all the other numbers that have been in close proximity to the smartphone, making it easier to trace anyone who might have been near the owner in the event of a positive Covid-test.Not all of these developments are bad, provided they are genuinely used as weapons against disease rather than vehicles for the expansion of state power.But we have seen since   how the excuse of security can be used as a cover for bullying by the authorities, with the result that international air travel is often a miserable experience.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.We should not allow the same to happen on a national scale in the wake of the pandemic.As the great author C.S.Lewis wrote: “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.#It would be better to live under robber barons than omnipotent moral busybodies.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As I say, this baffling statement will make zero dference to their already fractured relationship with the UK.In an ideal world, every media outlet worldwide would form a pact that they will never again write about or use a photograph of the Sussexes.The effect would be swt and damning.For without the oxygen of publicity, what are they Married to a home-body, I have always rather envied those whose other halves travel frequently for their job.It gives you the house to yourself sporadicallyand makes you appreciate them when they .But in lockdown we are faring well because we are already used to being together most of the time.A friend whose husband usually travels for work called me the other day to say that his sudden, constant presence in the home was causing friction.And yesterday, Boyzone star Shane Lynch announced the sad news that lockdown has put his -year marriage to Sheena White under intolerable strain.He says: “I’m not even in my family home right now because me and her were at each other’s throats.“It wasn’t a good time or a good space.“I’m usually on the road and for the first time I’ve spent three months in my house . . . it can be a struggle.”Indeed it can. Let’s hope they sort it out for the sake of their two children.Now the dust has settled around Professor Neil Ferguson’s original estimate of , Covid deaths, it’s perhaps time to stand back and take a logical overview of the situation.While the death toll is still worrying, the mantra that we are critically harming the economy to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed is undermined by the news that many of the private hospitals repurposed for Covid patients are lying virtually empty and the ,-bed facility set up in London’s ExCel centre is only treating  people.It’s adding credence to the burgeoning mindset that, perhaps, those who are considered vulnerable should remain in lockdown while the rest of the country makes a gradualto school or work while maintaining strict social distancing measures.On GMB yesterday, a gruff, Swedish professor, whose name escaped me, was asked to explain the thinking behind his country’s policy to keep everything open.He replied: “People are not stupid.”In other words, the Swedes are taking personal responsibility for how they behave and, as of earlier this week, the death rate was starting to decline.It remains to be seen whether Sweden’s outlier stance proves to be the correct one, but one thing is for certain: Its economy may be weakened at the end of it, but it won’t be on the critical list like ours.Model and businessman David Gandy talked about the importance of fostering at the weekend, under the headline, “OMG. He’s so cute!”Indeed he is, was my immediate thought. My second was that I would happily foster him anytime.However, it turns out the headline and suggestion of benevolence was aimed at Dora, his rescue pup from Battersea Dogs Home, for which David is an ambassador.He says: “What I love about the evenings now is the calmness of a tired, sleeping dog at your side. I watch Dora dreaming.”Lucky Dora.One wondersshe knows that, when it comes to good fortune, she has won the canine equivalent of the Lottery.Last year, I read to kids in a primary school and, with rare exception, every time I asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, they replied: “A YouTuber.”Yet last week, while queuing behind a mother and her daughter outside the supermarket, the young girldeclared her desire to become a nurse when she left school.Now that is something positive to come out of the Covid- crisis.Jigsaws are getting me through the long days of lockdown.Despite The Bloke’s lame attempts to hide the last pieceI completed my fth at the weekend and, as an exercise in mindfulness, it’s right up there with any yoga retreat.So imagine my joy when Kodak announced last week that it has produced the world’s largest jigsaw with, gulp, , pieces.It is  separate images of world landmarks and, when finished, covers  square metres – about the size of a standard living room. Sadly, it also costs £, so I’ll stick to my ,-piece cheapies. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

£.billion of PPE like gloves, gowns, and eye protectors, and up to £million worth of ventilators.None of the equipment has yet arrived, but contracts with most suppliers have been signed meaning Member States can now submit orders.EU officials expect the first batches of personal protection kit to be delivered next month.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL

First, the EU scheme has spectacularly failed to deliver anything.Indeed — as I suggest below — the EU is coming apart at the seams over this virus.And second, the invitation to join the scheme was sent, by those EU genii, to the wrong address. Duh.It is becoming more apparent with every day that passes that the civil service is the biggest impediment to the UK reforming itself.It is hostile to the Government, to the people — and deeply hostile to change of any kind.It is a vast congregation of time-serving bureaucrats dedicated only to saving their own jobs.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealEven now, red tape may be stling our efforts to deal with the coronavirus.It will be interesting to discover, once this pandemic has receded, what part the civil service played in the UK’s failure to carry out adequate testing for the virus, right from the start.And the failure to bring in vital equipment.Government ministers carry the can for these sorts of failures, of course.But it is the civil service charged with enacting the decisions.I wonder how many ventilators have failed to arrive here because of some bureaucratic hitch I wonder what would have happenedthe civil service, rather than the military, were charged with building those Nightingale hospitals.They might just about be ready by the end of the century.It was clear, when this Government came to office, that the real opposition wasn’t the ragged hounds and trots on the Labour benches, but from the very people paid to enable the government — the civil service.There needs to be a clear-out, from the top down.Because this battle — between civil servants and Government ministers — will continue long after this virus has been defeated.Their opposition to Government policy hampers almost everything we do.That’s no way to run a country.I see The Vicar Of Dibley is back.

Everybody is very clear on that.“If you actually have symptoms you need to isolate, full stop.“A cloth mask is not a replacement for staying at home and nobody should think otherwise.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Government is following SAGE advice, but will not be handing out free masks, as some other countries have.He added: “We have to make sure we have supplies available for health and care staff.”Prof Whitty also warned ministers today they face dficult “trade-offs” when they review the lockdown again by May , when the three-week extension ends.He said SAGE is working on options to ease some restrictions, but they will have downsides.None could happen until the rate of transmission ­— known as R — was below one person giving it to one other “at any point”.Prof Whitty added: “We have to be very realisticpeople are hoping it’s suddenly going to move from where we are in lockdown to where suddenly everything is gone.“That is a wholly unrealistic expectation.“If you release more on one area, you have to keep on board more of another area so there’s a proper trade-off.”He added: “It does not take very long from bad numbers to really bad numbers.”No  officials refer to what happens after May  as the “next phase”.A “suck-it-and-see” plan is being drawn up based on scientists’ data to see what restrictions to try easing first.One senior figure told The Sun: “We will try a bit at a time, and then pause, so we can see what effect that has on the transmission rate.

Weve lost too many lives already.When you follow the guidelines, when you stay home, you are doing something directly personally that is not just helping the NHS, but saving lives.BQ had been closed since the end of March since the introduction of lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-.Customers had been able to use click and collect services to purchase goods after hardware stores were included on the governments list of essential retailers.The store carried out a trial in  stores over the weekend and opened them fully - with restrictions.It today opened a further  stores and pictures show Brits following rules as they patiently queue to enter.A BQ spokesperson said: As an essential retailer, we’re committed to providing the best possible service to support customers’ home improvement needs at this dficult time, while keeping customers and colleagues safe.Having watched other essential retailers support social distancing in their stores, we are now following their best practice and are re-opening some stores with strict social distancing measures in place.Similar to shopping at a supermarket, we’re strictly limiting the number of customers in store at any one time, and so customers are typically queueing before entering stores.All stores have a designated queuing area outside and these have two metre markers to help remind everyone to respect each other’s personal space.To further support social distancing, we have two metre floor markers throughout the store and have also installed perspex screens at the checkouts.We’re urging all customers to follow the Government’s social distancing guidelines, to shop responsibly only for what is necessary and to be patient whilst we give them the best possible service in the safest possible way.The warm and sunny weather has made coronavirus lockdown even harder for Brits, with it forecast to be hotter than Lanzerote today and tomorrow.It brings fears the temperature will be too tempting for some as the weekend arrives at the end of five weeks of being stuck indoors.Most of the country will enjoy the balmy weather, with temperatures hitting C in Wales and C in Scotland.The shocked journalist who saw the footballers in Burgess Park yesterday tweeted: Not surprising that Southwark is one of the worst-hit London boroughs from #COVID.

including a steady drop in new infections and deaths.And ministers have insisted they will not begin to talk about how the measures will end just yet because they dont want to muddy the water by talking about an exit.The focus should be on staying home, Government ministers have repeatedly said, and they dont want to confuse the message.Ms Sturgeons intervention comes as Brits start to head to parks and more people travel on the roads in defiance of lockdown restrictions as the weather heats up.More traffic was reported in last nights Downing Street press conference, as some begin to tire of the measures in place.Last night Professor Whitty said the nation was still weeks away from seeing a signicant decline in numbers.He said: We are working with a disease we are going to be with globally for the foreseeable future. lots of options which ministers will have to consider.They key to ending lockdown was to ease measures in way where no infected person is, on average, infecting more than one person.Ms Sturgeon also said she could introduce dferent measures in Scotland to that of the rest of the UK -

we are going to expose more people to the virusHe said it was essential to open up parts of the economy, to rescue them from being completely decimated by the lockdown.I see no reason why garden centres, DIY stores with proper social isolating couldnt begin to open.Sir Geoffrey and other members of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers called a private meeting yesterday where they unanimously expressed deep concern of the continual lockdown, according to The Times.Sir Geoffrey said: The nation is quite ided on this and its up to the government, I think, to exercise leadership.Unless we do something fairly soon the economy is going to take a real hit.Vice Chairman of the committee Sir Charles Walker said There has got to be an economy to go back to.All MPs right now are dealing with dozensnot hundreds of local businesses that are fearing for their future.Building capacity within the NHS, reducing infection rates has to be the precursor to lting the economic lockdown.

So what top tips do we have for fasting during Islams holiest month Ramadan marks the month when the Koran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad by Allah.Ramadan will see Muslims around the world fasting during daylight hours for  days.Those observing the fast are encouraged to read the Koran and the holy text is recited at the Tarawih, special nightly prayers that would normally be held at mosques throughout the month but cant this year due to coronavirus.Coronavirus lockdown has hit all religions hard, with services and places of worship being shut down and moved online.Fasting begins at sunrise on Friday, April , .During the month of Ramadan, Muslims are obliged to abstain from eating or drinking during daylight hours.If a fast is broken, it will need to be compensated for by fasting at a later date. Or they can pay fidyah, a religious term for donation of food or money.Adult Muslims are also expected to read and reflect on the entire Koran, the holy book, while abstaining from smoking and sex.Muslims break their fast at sunset when they partake of tar, a social occasion.Suhoor is the meal Muslims eat before fasting for the day.We recommend eating something filling that will get you through the day to tar.Foods that are high in fibre release energy slowly, keeping you fuller for longer.They include oat porridge, wholegrain cereal, breads, fruits and vegetables.Salty foods like crisps will make you thirsty, and we all know that drinking is banned during daylight.Bonus tip: drink as much water as possible when youre allowed to as this will keep your body hydrated throughout the day.However, the NHS recommends adults break their fastthey become very dehydrated.On their website they warn: “Poor hydration can be made worse by weather conditions and even everyday activities like walking to work or housework.“If you produce very little or no urine, feel disoriented and confused or faint as a result of dehydration, you must stop fasting and have a drink of water or other fluid.”You cant eat when youre sleeping! Take naps whenever hunger seems to get the best of you.With any luck, youll wake up feeling refreshed and will have more energy to fight the hunger.It is no secret that lockdown is boring, and boredom can lead to hunger.Keep yourself busy to help repress your hunger.Paint, exercise, clean, or have a Netflix binging session.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Christine Farquharson, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: Key workers are essential to the UKaposs response to the Covid- pandemic, and they have certainly earned our gratitude. While some key worker sectors have very low pay - those in the food sector earn just £. per hour on average - other key workers earn much more. Any policy plans to change key workersapos working conditions after the pandemic has passed will need to take these dferences into account. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: There are millions of key workers earning less than the real Living Wage of £. in the UK and £. in London. As we emerge from this crisis, we have the opportunity to reassess how we value these critical roles - the best way to thank key workers is by paying at least a real Living Wage.

The document adds: If, after easing any restrictions, the evidence tells us we are unable to contain the transmission of the virus then we will have to re-impose them, possibly ing to lockdown with little notice. While we will do our best to avoid this, it is possible that such a cycle may happen more than once until we reach a point when we have in place an effective vaccine. While the paper was produced by the Scottish government, it gives an insight into the sort of approaches that might eventually be taken across the whole of the UK. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sits in COBRA meetings with the UK government, and the four home nations have broadly taken the same approach to the lockdown. The UK government has refused to comment on its own exit plan, saying people must focus on the message of staying home to protect the NHS. But Downing Street today appeared to voice a similar approach to the possibility of multiple lockdowns to the Scottish government. The PMaposs spokesman said the most important factor is that R, the number of people each carrier infects, is below one. We cannot allow the R to go above one for any extended period at any point, he said. No also did not contradict Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, who last night said some restrictions will need to last until .Boris Johnsonaposs said the government must do everything we can to keep the infection rate down. Mr Johnsonaposs official spokesman insisted the UK government was treating the public like grown-ups, despite not spelling out an exit plan.

Experts are aposfinalisingapos advice to ministers, Number  said yesterday. The SAGE advisory group met on Tuesday to discuss whether to change the UK’s guidance on the general public wearing masks, and are meeting again today. It follows reports that experts were recommending face coverings - such as cloth masks or scarves - could stop people with the disease but without symptoms from passing it on to others. But there are fears telling the public to wear masks could lead to more shortages of equipment to keep NHS staff safe. Hereaposs the science, the current advice and what might happen next. What is the UK advice on face masks  It is currently not compulsory to wear a mask or face covering but the Government has said it is continuing to monitor the situation. Public Health Englandrecommends masks for NHS staff and social care workers but does not suggest other people wear them outside.London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for a change in advice to add another layer of protection to members of the public against Covid-.He has previously said: In those circumstances where we canapost keep our social distance, we canapost keep two metres apart, think about when youaposre using public transport and you really have to, or youaposre in a shop and you canapost keep two metres apart. Wearing a non-medical facial covering makes it less likely you may inadvertently give somebody  Covid-. Will the advice change   Scientists are expected to discuss the usage of masks in a meeting on Thursday. A top doctor has said it would make sense to advise the public to wear coverings on a voluntary basis and expects the Government to alter its guidance. The chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Professor Martin Marshall said: If [people] are coughing and spluttering then it makes complete sense to wear masks in order to protect other people. He told the BBCaposs Today Programme: I think the guidance that weaposre expecting to hear is that the wearing of face masks is a voluntary activity not mandated and it certainly makes a lot of sense to focus limited resources that we have at the moment on those who have greatest need and thataposs the health professionals.Are there enough masks for key workers and the general public  NHS bosses have urged the Government to make sure that there are enough masks for medical staff before making any compulsory orders for the public. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and NHS trusts in England, asked ministers to fully assess the potential impact on healthcare supplies.In a statement on Monday, he said: Fluid repellent masks for health and care staff are key to safety and to avoid the spread of coronavirus.Securing the supply of masks, when there is huge global demand, is crucial. This must be a key consideration for Government. There needs to be clear evidence that wearing masks, along with other measures, will deliver signicant enough benefits to take us out of lockdown to potentially jeopardise NHS mask supply. Will I be given a maskthey are made compulsory   The Government has said it canapost promise everybody will be given a mask for freethe public are forced to wear them.Matt Hancock was asked the question by former Labour minister Hilary Benn in the House of Commons, and replied: I canapost promise that we will give everybody free masks, I mean that would be an extraordinary undertaking, and we do have to make sure that we have supplies available especially for health and social care staff, where the scientic advice throughout has been that the wearing of masks is necessary in those circumstances and weaposve got to make sure the provision is there for them.Are they effective  According to European scientists there is no evidence that non-medical standard face masks or other covers offer protection to wearers. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that a non-medical mask has a filter efficiency of between two and %. However, the World Health Organisation recommends face mask use during pandemics to reduce transmission from asymptomatic people.  Can I make my own mask  Masks can be made from cloth materials found at home, or items that can be wrapped around the face such as a scarf. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary healthcare at the University of Oxford, told a Royal Society of Medicine web briefing: How do you make your own mask  You take two pieces of cotton, or a piece of cotton folded over, and you take a pantyliner or something like that [with] waterproof backing, you stick it between those. And then you hook it around the back of your ears.

Former UK Government adviser Daniel Sleat and Ryan Wain are two of the authors of The Path to Mass Testing, a report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. It  a blueprint for how contact tracing can bring countries out of lockdown.Here they write exclusively in the Mirror and discuss the only way the UK could ease its coronavirus lockdown before a vaccine is found - something which it was warned today could be many, many months away.The Government has two choices. Remain in lockdown and suppress Covid- or leave lockdown and contain the virus. We believe that containment is possible but only through mass testing and tracing. This means millions of us being tested regularly and – should we test positive – being isolated along with those who have come into contact with us. This is a huge operation. Perhaps the biggest in peacetime.  So when Matt Hancock set a target of , tests a day, it was ambitious but only the start of what needs to be done. The truth is we will need much higher numbers of tests available and an army of people to deliver them. We will need technology that doesn’t yet exist in Britain.  Testing figures need to be much higher and accompanied by the right strategy on which groups the Government intends to roll out testing to. We can look abroad for inspiration. The Germans can test , per week and in South Korea they flattened their infection curve through mass community testing and contact tracing.  They were prepared better than the UK. It’s critical that the structure of government changes during these extraordinary times. Testing is so important that a senior Minister should oversee it, reporting directly to the Prime Minister and have a team of the brightest minds from outside politics who are experts in procurement, logistics and scaling big projects. They should have the authority to find every inch of laboratory space in the country and use it for testing. That’s what the renowned Robert Koch Institute did in Germany. Finally, the government has shted its gaze from antibody tests.

Asked directlymeasures could stay until , the Prime Ministeraposs spokesman stressed the government must do everything we can to keep the infection rate down. And he did not deny claims by Englandaposs Chief Medical Officer - who last night said the country will likely need very socially disruptive measures into next year.It raises the bleak prospect of pubs and restaurants - which Michael Gove said would be among the last to reopen - remaining shut until autumn or winter.The PMaposs spokesman today stressed he was not making a prediction as it is too early to discuss lting the lockdown - and said he would not pre-empt scientic advice. But he did not disown or deny remarks by Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty. Prof Whitty last night warned the public must be realistic that the only way back to normal le is a vaccine or treatment. He added: The probability of having those any time in the next calendar year are incredibly small. Prof Whittyaposs claim was similar to one by Chief Scientic Advisor Patrick Vallance, who last week said some measures need to continue until thereaposs a vaccine.  Today, the PMaposs spokesman confirmed Prof Whitty was referring to the end of  in his remarks. And Downing Street did not distance itself from his claims. AskedProf Whitty was right, and highly disruptive measures could remain in place for that period, the PMaposs official spokesman said: The key to this is not having a second peak.Having a second peak would be bad not only on health grounds, but also bad for business and the economy. We have to do everything we can to keep R below one and prevent that second peak. In terms of the steps we take in the coming weeks and months will be guided by the scientic advice. It’s not sensible for me to pre-empt that. aposRapos refers to the number of people each virus carrier infects on average. If it is more than one, the virus spreads exponentially. If it is less than one, it dies back. The No spokesman added the most important factor is that R, the rate of transmission, needs to be below one. We cannot allow the R to go above one for any extended period at any point.  He went on: I think the Chief Medical Officer set out in a signicant amount of detail the issues which himself and his colleagues and then ministers will have to look at as we go forward. It comes as Tory backbench MPs pile pressure on the government to spell out its plan for easing the lockdown.Scotlandaposs First Minister today published a -page document on her possible exit plan, saying businesses might be able to reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart.Nicola Sturgeon also suggested schools could reopen with modications needed in some classrooms. Outdoor activities mighttoo.  But Ms Sturgeon warned pubs may not be back any time soon, and the nation would need to find a new normal. Senior Tory MPs believe the lockdown risks causing harm in dferent ways to the disease by crippling the economy. Senior Tory Geoffrey Clton-Brown told the BBC: We need to start this discussion about how we get back to normality. We could begin to think about what are the next steps on a step-by-step basis. The PMaposs spokesman stressed that any work on easing parts of the lockdown UK-wide will be done by scientic advice group SAGE.

The slowdown in infection rates prompted Dominic Raab to claim there is now a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is a tribute to all our NHS staff but also to the way the country has stoically accepted the social distancing restrictions. But we have to accept there is still a long way to go. The Government’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said there is an incredibly small chance of developing an effective vaccine within the next calendar year. This implies we may have to weather the economic and social turbulence for longer than had been hoped. This will be especially challenging for those who are having to self-isolate. And families will be worried about schooling and finances. Which is why it is all the more important ministers are candid about what lies ahead. It is also essential the Government raises its game when it comes to supporting those working on the front line. Each day staff are placing their lives at risk because of a shortage of protective kit. The Government says it is doing everything it can. But this does not ring true when we learned yesterday that at least three dozen firms had reached out to offer to manufacture supplies only for their offer to fall on deaf ears. Labour leader Keir Starmer got it right in his impressive debut at Prime Minister’s ­Questions. There is a pattern, he said, which has seen the Government being too slow to bring in the lockdown, too slow on testing and too slow on protective equipment. NHS staff, carers, volunteers, the Armed Forces, unions and business have stepped up to the plate. It is time for ministers to do so.

Downing Street will reportedly ask businesses to introduce staggered start times for their employees to reduce the possible spread of coronavirus. One option being touted would see the busy morning commute separated into three separate slots, with workers beginning their shts at am, am and pm. Bosses could also be asked to introduce weekend working or working alternate days instead of the typical Monday to Friday week. A Cabinet source told the Sun : “We have to get the wheels of the economy turning again soon or there won’t be much left of it. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.“But le and work is going to look very dferent when it happens, whether itaposs staggered rush hours or going in every other day.” The news comes as the UK government said it was planning for new normal once stringent lockdown restrictions were finally lted.

The measures are due to next be reviewed on May  and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in an indication the lockdown will be eased then, said he was preparing to ramp up contact tracing on a large scale as a way of keeping the virus under control. In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hancock said he was confident the country was at the peak of the outbreak but stressed that continued social distancing was currently needed to bring the number of new cases down.  He also said a contact tracing app which will alert peoplethey have been in contact with somebody with the virus and should self-isolate was currently in trials. He said: “We have to make sure we’ve got that evidence before we start touting around ideas. “The minute we can responsibly do so based on the evidence, we will.” Passenger numbers in London are down around % on the Tube and % on buses, cutting income from fares to a fraction of normal levels. The capitalaposs mayor said that TfL had lost hundreds of millions of pounds of revenue as a result of the measures.  Mr Khan said: Unless the Government gives us a grant, we will not be able to continue to run the service we have. Mr Khanaposs comments come after Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram, the metro mayors for Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region respectively, called for Government funding to support city centre transport. Mr Burnham said Manchesteraposs link system may have to be suspended as it was losing millions of pounds a month. Merseyrail, which operates in Liverpool and surrounding areas, was losing £. million a week and was being reduced to a core service for essential workers, Mr Rotheram said. Last month, the Department for Transportsuspended traditional rail franchise agreements to avoid train companies collapsing, but the metro mayors said the rail systems in their cities had not been given any support.

The major roads are not back to normal, but the photos do show a steady stream of traffic. This apparent upturn comes despite non-essential journeys still being outlawed, with police forces able to collar and fine those who venture out without a proper purpose. On April  - Easter Sunday - traffic on UK roads fell to just % of pre-lockdown levels, according to data from the Department of Transport. A week later however, and that figure had risen to % - equivalent to the highest number of daily journeys than since the lockdown began. As well as lockdown fatigue, the reason for these extra trips may be to do with the increasing number of destinations on offer.  Stores including BQ, Nandos and Burger King have begun to remove the mothballs and fire up their tills again. BQ carried out a trial reopening of  stores over the weekend, in order to try out whether social distancing measures could be followed. Today it was announced that a further  outlets would be reopened, with two metre floor marking throughout the building and clear guards in front of the cashiers desks. BQ is not the only business which has reopened. KFC has opened the doors of  of its restaurants, for delivery only, and with staff having to volunteer to work.  The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. Nandos has also reopened four shops - four in London, two in Manchester and one in Dublin. The chicken business is putting its peri-peri expertise to good use by providing , free meals to key workers each day. Burger King is also tentatively warming up its engines after a month of being closed.  The fast food giant has reopened two restaurants in Bristol, one in Coventry and one in Swindon. Staff will wear masks and gloves to cook food, which will be delivery only. While it is offering a parred-back menu with % of the usual items, it is donating , meals to NHS staff a week. The royal patty provider is not the only burger shop up and running either. Five Guys is opening a further seven stores, adding to the  that remained open during the lockdown.  The reopening of parts of Britainaposs hospitality sector comes despite the fact that most journeys are still outlawed.

Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders , warned that planning would need to begin very soon for that to happen. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said on Sunday that the Government had not yet reached a decision on when to reopen schools. Britainaposs schools were ordered to close more than a month ago, except for children of key workers and vulnerable children, as the coronavirus pandemic sent the country into lockdown. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. There are many details to be worked out to ensure the safety of pupils, staff and their families at home once schools re-open. Headteachers are expecting a lead in time of weeks to prepare for a stagedthat aims to maintain social distancing. It means pupils could rotate between studying in the classroom and at home so schools are not at full capacity. There could be limits on class sizes and staggered break times. Many teachers have said they will not go back to work without adequate personal protective equipmentand measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. Mr Barton said June  is the earliest that schools could re-open. He told the BBC: We cannot see any realistic way that schools could be re-opened to more pupils before the second half of the summer term. He said school leaders back the reliance on medical advice. During Sundayaposs media briefing at No, Mr Williamson said no date has been set for re-opening schools and there are no plans to open them over the summer. He said five tests must be met before schools can re-open. Mr Williamson said the five tests are protecting the NHSaposs ability to cope, seeing the daily death rates come down, having reliable data that shows the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels, sufficient supplies of testing and protective equipment, and no risk of a second peak of infections. He said: People are anxious to know when weaposre going to relax restrictions, when schools are likely to be fully back and open again.  Of course, I want nothing more than to see schools back, get them back to normal, make sure the children are sat around, learning, and experiencing the joy of being at school. But I canapost give you a date. Because before we do, we need to meet five tests. He added: There are currently no plans to have schools open over the summer period and we havenapost been working on plans to have them open over the summer period. Headteachers have expressed doubts over whether social distancing is even possible in schools and noted the challenge of getting pupils to practice it.

The letter stressed the need for a phased approach to avoid a #xCyo-yo effect#xD of openings and closings which could see businesses fail and up to a million jobs lost. The six-point plan sets out the level of support the sector needs to reintegrate into the economy, to avoid mass redundancies and to ensure local businesses and high-street brands can survive. Recommendations included extending the Government#xs furlough scheme beyond the end of June for hospitality businesses, legislative intervention on rent payments, improved access to capital and an overhaul of business regulation. UKHospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said: #xCWith social distancing measures still in place, reopening the hospitality sector without a plan would be catastrophic. #xCThe hospitality sector was one of the first hit by the crisis and the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue. It will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. #xCAn extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully, and many will not be able to open at all. Hospitality is a sector built around socialising, so there must be Government support for businesses that continue to be hit by this crisis. #xCWe need a plan of phased opening for our sector. For those businesses that can trade safely with social distancing measures still in place, they should be able to. #xCFor the many venues where it is not possible, support, such as the furlough scheme, must be extended to make sure these businesses stay alive and jobs kept open. We can#xt have a situation where, overnight, the entire sector is suddenly expected to hit the ground running. #xCIf the correct support is not in made available to help businesses get back to work when the time is right, then businesses will have survived the immediate crisis only to find themselves out of business during the aftermath.#xD\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",Read more here. \",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\", The number of confirmed cases in the country rose by , to ,.\",\"author\":[,],\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"mainEntityOfPage\":\"https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-pandemic-uk-live-updates-\",hay fever.

His friends and family, we were all fighting for him but he couldn’t do it anymore and gave up the fight.” In a tribute to her son, Red’s mum Polly Gale said: “You had a soft, warm and loving heart. A heart that would fiercely protect the vulnerable, because you understood how it felt. You lived with a wounded heart for far too long and I wished everyday that the universe would protect you to heal that beautul heart of yours.” The family are now asking for more support for people  struggling with their mental health, especially during the lockdown. “He was let down, we reached out to services, GPs, hotlines and everything but as soon as the pandemic started it felt like he was being passed around and that they closed the doors on him, Autumn said.

The mum-of-three had been rushed to hospital on March  when she began to feel as though she was suffocating. Although initially diagnosed with pneumonia, Danielle, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, later tested positive for Covid- on April . Her partner Bryan Green feared the worst and at one point was told it was highly unlikely their unborn child would survive. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here But a few days later, he was grinning from ear to ear when Danielle phoned and told him she was out of intensive care, and expecting twins.At first, I just had a sore throat which led to a bad chest and I thought it must be a chest infections but I could barely breath after six days, Danielle recalls.It felt like I was suffocating so Bryan decided to call an ambulance who came within five minutes and took me away. I was put on a ventilator which helped and I was managing - I was struggling to breath and talk - it was terrying. Overnight, Danielleaposs oxygen levels dropped, leaving medics with no choice but to put her into an induced coma. Bryan , refers to her time in hospital as a living nightmare. It is crazy how quick things can take a turn for the worse - one day Danielle was sending me photos telling me about the toast she is eating in hospital and then the next she is in ICU, he said. The doctor rang to say her oxygen had dropped and sheaposs been put into an induced coma - I was devastated and worried sick.  The security guard says it was particularly hard to explain to their children Jaiden, nine, Parker, three and Joshua, two where their mum was. They had watched her go in the ambulance from the window, he continued. I had to put on a brave face and reassure them she will be fine and be home in no time. The hospital rang me daily with updates but it was always up and down - one day it would be good news and the next bad.  I was hoping she would pull through with all my heart. At one point, the doctor rang him to say Danielle was spotting and that it was highly unlikely their baby would survive so early in the pregnancy. It was a living nightmare knowing she is fighting for her le and our unborn baby too, Bryan said. But thankfully, we started to receive some good news - she was getting better and they are weaning her off the ventilator. Once she was out of ICU and on a ward, she rang me to tell me both babies are fine - I was like aposboth apos At first I thought maybe she is still a little confused from everything she had been through. But when she said twins, I was so happy and grinning from ear to ear. Danielle hadnapost been out for ten days prior to catching the virus, and says she feels incredibly lucky to have survived. She has warned others to stay at home as it could happen to anyone. I woke up feeling very confused an agitated from the coma but once I had came round, I was extremely grateful, she said.

It was a very special day for the Cambridges and the rest of the Royal Family, but it will also go down in history. When Kate gave birth to her third child at .am, Charlotte made his history thanks to a change in the law years before. The little princess became the first female royal to retain her claim to the throne and not be bumped down the line by the arrival of a new male. The change is thanks to the Succession to the Crown Act . It states: In determining the succession to the Crown, the gender of a person born after  October  does not give that person, or that person’s descendants, precedence over any other person . If this change hadnapost been introduced Princess Charlotte, who is currently fourth in line to the throne, would have been bumped down to fth and Louis would have taken her old spot. Instead, Louis is fth in the line of succession after his grandfather Prince Charles, dad Prince William and siblings George and Charlotte. The last woman to be affected by this is Princess Anne.  When she was born in August  she was second in line to the throne after her big brother Charles. However, before long the Queen and Prince Philip had welcomed Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. The boys overtook Ann, leaving her in fourth in line to the throne.  When she fell pregnant, she knew her children would be bumped even further down the list when their cousins were born, so opted against giving Zara and Peter HRH titles. This allowed them to lead more normal lives and have careers of their own. The world celebrated with Kate and William when they announced their little boy had been born.

People have been ordered to stay in their homes unless they are shopping for groceries, exercising, helping a vulnerable person or going to work . All non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, with pubs, restaurants, bars, cinemas and clubs all shutting up shop for the foreseeable future. Thousands of staff members have been put on furlough, with the government paying % of their wages in an effort to protect jobs.When will pubs reopen  There is no official date for pubs to reopen, and the government has refused to rule out the possibility that theyaposll be closed until Christmas. Itaposs thought that the lockdown will be relaxed in stages, with restrictions gradually lted from June. Itaposs likely that essential businesses will be allowed to reopen first, and itaposs also possible that dferent areas of the country will have dferent rules lted at dferent times. Vulnerable people may also be asked to remain in their homes for longer, while younger people with no health conditions could be allowed toto work. The government has suggested that the hospitality industry will be one of the last to get back to normal. Pubs encourage the public to socialise in small spaces, making them the perfect breeding ground for COVID-. One person could infect countless strangers, who would then each carry the virus to their own families, co-workers and friends. Itaposs therefore unlikely that pubs will open until the coronavirus crisis has substantially subsided.

Itaposs thought the South American Andean Condors were going hungry with less food to scavenge during lockdown and may have been on the look out for something to eat. The intimidating birds can be seen landing on the ledge of the apartment as the dogs bark at them from the other side of the glass. As the poodles run up and down, the birds are trained on them, following the pups along the windowsill. When one of the dogs shows no fear to jump on to ledge and put its paws against the glass, one of the condors pecks at the glass in a failed attempt to get to it.The footage is thought to have been shot in Chile and local media reported the dogs remained completely unharmed as the windows were closed at the time. South American Andean Condorsare the largest flying birds in the world in terms of combined measurements of weight and wingspan, which can stretch to . metres. The International Union for Conservation of Nature classies them as aposnear threatenedapos in their red list. They have white feathers around black plumage and have a distinctive bald head which can change colour depending on its emotional state.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund.

Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies.

season in the lower isions and dish out much-needed prize money.That was after the American’s initially-intended “no” vote changed to a “yes” to allow the resolution to pass in exchange for firm promises on league reconstruction five days later.That sparked an outcry from the club’s fans over the U-turn which saw Dundee United crowned Championship winners.And the Dundee Supporters Association – which is made up of  clubs comprising , members – sent an email to the Dens supremo asking for “clarity” over the change in position and how it would benefit the Dark Blues.Nelms responded with a club statement to reiterate he “got the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration proposed” and followed that up with a phone conversation with DSA chairman Kenny Ross.The DSA committee then released a statement stating they were pleased that the push for league reconstruction shows Nelms and owner Tim Keyes “are in this for the long haul”.The statement included: “We were pleased that the club not only released an updated statement later that day but that managing director John Nelms also personally contacted a member of the DSA committee by phone.“Mr Nelms was more than able to adequately explain the club’s thought processes and position and demonstrate how he was able to get the best possible outcome for Dundee Football Club in an impossible situation.“When Dundee realised their vote hadn’t been cast on April , the dynamic changed and it is clear to the DSA that Mr Nelms has worked tirelessly since and as a result of the SPFL releasing the results of the ballot before all of the member votes were in, was put in an unfair, undemocratic and dficult position.“With regards to league reconstruction we suspect that none of the  SPFL chairmanpushed harder for it than John Nelms and, as a result, a working party has been established to discuss it, which was not on the table in the original resolution.“It would not have been convened had Dundee voted ‘No’ as they had originally intended and this has to be a good thing and in the best interests of Dundee FC.“We were therefore pleased to learn that John himself will be on that working group and gives proof,any were needed that John and Tim Keyes are in this for the long haul.“The DSA are therefore happy and satisfied that Mr Nelms worked in best interests of both Dundee FC and Scottish football in general and got the best possible outcome for our club in a very dficult situation.“The Dundee FC Supporters Association has had a good working relationship with Mr Nelms and his board in recent years and we are grateful that he responded to our request swtly and satisfactorily and look forward to this relationship continuing in the future.”EXCLUSIVE: John Nelms answers fan worries saying #yes# vote got best possible deal for Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp exclusive-dundee-fans-want-answers-from-john-nelms-over-vote-u-turn embed # secretVsoNNDXU\" data-secret\"VsoNNDXU\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.40533577-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.40533577-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.40533577-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.40533577-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united reconstruction spfl","story":"It’s great to see talks have already begun over league reconstruction and I’m glad they will be speedy ones – getting all this mess behind us will be for the better.Even a global pandemic can’t stop the drama that continually surrounds Scottish football.This past couple of weeks have taken the biscuit, though.I read Ann Budge’s comments recently about getting the plans in place as soon as possible and, for me, that’s the right idea.The quicker we get things sorted the better for everyone – clubs can plan ahead for whatever ision they will be in and there will, at last, be some clarity over what the future holds.Evenwe don’t know when the game will .I suggested a few weeks back that revamping our set-up to include  teams in the top flight would be a way to stop anyone being unfairly damaged by the coronavirus shutdown.I stand by that. In an ideal world I’d like to see an even bigger league with Dundee given the chance to join United in the Premiership.Whether that can happen, we’ll have to wait and see.We’re right at the start of the process so I’m sure almost anything is still on the table.I hope all the clubs in this area get something out of reconstruction. What we get should be better for Scottish football.I just hope we can avoid the same sort of voting farce we had  days ago with the SPFL.Dundee and managing director John Nelms were left in an impossible position, evensome of the behaviour has been questionable.As far as I’m concerned we should move on now and look to a better future. Ideally one with United and the Dark Blues in the top flight together.I know the existing Premiership clubs would certainly want the Dee up, too.What we know for sure, having seen the goings-on for the past couple of weeks, is clubs will only vote for something that is in their own interest. That’s just the way the world is.The good news, I think, for Dundee in all that is having them catapulted into the top flight would be seen to have plenty of plus points for it.Just ask Aberdeen – having both our city clubs back in the top flight gives them more decent away crowds coming to Pittodrie and their fans good away days.They wouldn’t be the only ones that benefit from having the Dundee derby back in the Premiership.We need the biggest teams at the top table – make it happen!It’s a few days ago now but I want to offer my congratulations to Robbie Neilson and his team after Dundee United were crowned Championship winners.The Tangerines have been in pole position right from the first whistle and it’s more than deserved for all at Tannadice.We don’t know what the top flight might look like come next season but the main objective has been achieved by Robbie – get United back in the big time.That’s been the target for four years now.It’s taken far longer than anyone associated with the club would have liked but they’ve finally done it.With all the noise going on over the past couple of weeks over the season, just having their top spot confirmed must be a huge weight off their shoulders.With the way the world is, relief will be the main feeling I’d bet for Robbie, Tony Asghar and Mark Ogren.They’ve done their bit – now it’s about improving the team for a shot at what is likely to be a bigger Premiership next campaign.Well done United!Having only seen the info that’s come out in the press, I’ve found Dundee United’s fall-out with a supporters’ group strange.It sounds like the money the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation were looking to put into the club would be a benefit for everyone at Tannadice.There’s obviously been a disagreement behind the scenes but it doesn’t sit right with me having a go at your own fans – and on the day before the club were crowned champions, too.Jackie McNamara being up and about again was great to see last week. We were together in Scotland squads and he helped me a lot at that time. It’s fantastic to hear he’s on the mend again after a real health shock.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This has been clearly signposted and we have removed the pins, plugged the holes and are keeping the grass on the greens as long as possible to discourage play.“Despite these efforts, we continue to have iniduals out on the courses, deliberately ignoring the clear guidelines set out.“To make matters worse, greenkeepers carrying out essential maintenance have faced abuse when they have asked people to leave the course.”He added: “We have a fantastic golfing community in Aberdeen and the vast majority are abiding by the rules. However, a few continue to disregard them.“To them we have a clear message – our courses are closed.“I would urge iniduals to be respectful of this and to follow the current guidance: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”It has emerged that police issued a fixed penalty notice to one person who was caught golfing at the MacKenzie course on April .The game’s national governing body Scottish Golf has also issued guidance urging players to stay away.In a statement, it said: “While golf is an outdoor sport that allows players to exercise in the fresh air, the message to all of us is clear – we must stay home and play our part in containing the spread of Covid-.“Scottish Golf asks that all golfers in Scotland refrain from golfing until further notice.”Private courses have also reported problems with non-golfers abusing the facilities.Westhill Golf Club hit out at members of the public who let dogs off their leads, walked across greens and even played football on the course.And staff at Peterculter Golf Club have also reported problems, including dog owners leaving excrement on the course."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital.

He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

The school has an approximate  percent drop-out rate as the young men learn more of what God is calling them to do, and as they face the sometimes hard-to-accept vows which they must take.\"Every guy is dferent,\" said Bobby. \"To be honest, Im not  percent sure  percent is the rate of drop out Ive experienced over the past few years Ive been there. Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-economy-braces-biggest-recession-300-years-due-lockdown---likely-recover","story":"While adjusting to le in isolation has been dficult, businesses have been hit particularly hard by the restrictions, with the budget watchdog now warning the country could suffer its biggest recession in  yearslockdown continues into the summer.The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the economy could shrink by  per cent this spring, with unemployment levels reaching . million over the coming months - its highest level since the s.The struggling economy has sparked comparisons to the financial crash in , and the Great Depression of the s, but experts are now predicting the outcome will be much worse.Experts now believe the UK is headed for its biggest economic slump since , when the country was hit by a deep freeze that spread across Europe.Temperatures plummeted on January , bringing with it the worst winter in  years and freezing over several countries, including France, England and Russia.The lsquoGreat Frostrsquo, as it came to be known, lasted for three months and sparked food shortages, thousands of deaths in France, and a huge deficit to the economy.The coronavirus pandemic could see the economy shrink by a record  per cent by June, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas warned.A drop this big would mark the largest decline ldquoin living memory, Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR has said.However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak stressed that this forecast is just one possible scenario, and it merely suggests the scale of what the country is currently facing will have ldquoserious implications for our economy.He said: ldquoWe came into this crisis with a fundamentally sound economy, powered by the hard work and ingenuity of the British people and British businesses.ldquoOur planned economic response is protecting millions of jobs, businesses, self-employed people, charities and households.ldquoOur plan is the right plan.Mr Sunak assured that the government would not stand by and will act to support the economy, adding that the OBR expects the economic impact of the pandemic to be temporary.Despite being forecast for a signicant decline, the UK is expected toto its pre-coronavirus economic growth by the end of this year, with the OBR stating this amount will depend on how long the lockdown lasts.The OBR predicts that any drop in growth will be reversed in the three months to September, as the economy starts to recover.However, it warned that the pandemic may have a more lasting impact on unemployment, which is estimated to rise to . million by the end of June.Unemployment levels are currently . million, marking a rise from . per cent to  per cent.Unemployment rates are expected to remain high until , before dropping back to four per cent, according to the OBRrsquos forecast."},{"url":null,"title":"11-year-olds-thank-letter-delights-ambulance-staff","story":"Sarah Brady, , a primary seven pupil at Wallyford Primary School, was taking part in the first lsquoClap for our Carersrsquo event on March  with mum Samantha.She noticed the ambulance sitting at the end of her street so quickly drafted a letter and ran over with a rose and gave it to them.The letter read: ldquoThanks for everything yoursquore doing for the world, love Sarah Brady.Samantha said: ldquoThe clap was amazing.ldquoA few days later the ambulance had to come back to my house for my partner.ldquoThe ambulance lady said that two men were in Wallyford recently and someone gave them a letter and that they were really overwhelmed.

If you donrsquot let me explain. Adelphi is like the Linn of hi-fi, the Aston Martin of motoring, the Gleneagles of hotels ndash basically,you see anything with that name on a bottle, you know yoursquore in for a serious treat.So why does a company like this need to get involved in virtual tastings  Surely they donrsquot need the money, or the publicity  Connal Mackenzie, group sales manager with the company, says the reason theyrsquore doing it is much more basic than that.ldquoThis is the only way we can get out to the Adelphi people, he says. ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for this virus, wersquod be gearing up for festivals.ldquoWe were going to be launching a new whisky list anyway, and we usually try to fall in to some kind of festival to do that, get feedback them and pour some drams for people.ldquoWe wanted to bottle up some samples and get them to the people who are missing out on festivals around the UK and further afield. This was the ideal  to do that.Interest in everything that Adelphi produces is usually huge, and new bottlings usually sell out very quickly, so it came as no surprise to me when Mackenzie told me that when the event was publicised, the tasting packs ndash five new expressions that will be tasted during Fridayrsquos session ndash sold out within  hours, with interest from as far afield as Australia and America.Mackenzie will be conducting the tasting, alongside Alex Bruce, managing director of Adelphi, and Arthur Motley, of Royal Mile Whiskies, which sells Adelphi whisky and has worked closely with them on Fridayrsquos event.But he is at pains to stress that the tasting is no exclusive event. ldquoA total of  people will have a tasting pack ndash however, this is not just for those people.

Yet caring, sharing Jacinda Ardern has done exactly the same in New Zealand. No foreigners have been permitted to enter since the Antipodean country the lockdown.Nor is there any certainty that New Zealandrsquos borders are going to reopen any time soon. At the very least, future immigrants will have to put up with quarantine and long delaysthey are allowed into the country at all. Itrsquos a Brexiterrsquos wet dream.In Scotland, the Government is under pressure to explain why, as The Herald reported recently, , people have been allowed to enter the country apparently with barely any health checks at all. This seems to be a UK policy. Border controls are not devolved, and the UK Government seems to want to keep airports open for business.SNP MSPs and MPs are also talking about closing Scotlandrsquos border. MP Joanna Cherry has demanded, at the very least, rigorous health checks and quarantine at airports. Commentators, like our own Neil Mackay, are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to detach Scotland from the failing Westminster Government and introduce a rigorous independent policy of test, track and trace following Germanyrsquos lead.You only need to look at what is happening in Singapore to understand why voters are concerned about the UKrsquos laissez-faire approach to border security. This scrupulously tidy city state had been the poster child for Covid management. Thanks to its experience of SARS a decade ago it was well prepared.The lockdown was rapid and the country adopted mass testing and contact tracing from the start. By the beginning of April, Singapore seemed to be well on top of he disease. Then came the second wave.On Monday, Singapore recorded more than , new cases of Covid , its highest ever. The country of five million people now leads south-east Asia in the virulence of this disease.And who are they blaming  Well, the one million migrant workers, from countries like Bangladesh, who sweep the city streets and tend its butterfly gardens. The most virulent new outbreak is in their cramped dormitories.The Singapore authorities have quarantined thousands of migrant workers into what are to all intents and purposes Covid concentration camps. Eye witnesses report squalid conditions, rats and poor food.Now, New Zealand is one of the most liberal and open societies in the world. But it is going to allow migrants to enter the country freely any time soon  Is it going to allow the four million or so annual tourists  My daughter is one of them. Shersquos been in a Queenstown backpackers hostel under lockdown for the last month.The ethnic dimension to Covid is going to be a huge issue in the near future. Itrsquos already clear that BAME people are more prone to getting this disease. That may be genetic, or it may be to do with their social circumstances and over-crowding. But it means that, in authoritarian countries, they risk being singled out for epidemiological social cleansing.Covid is changing the world in dramatic and disturbing ways. We are seeing a big increase in economic nationalism. The European Union has been riven with tension over Germanyrsquos reluctance to share the Covid-related debts of Italy.Global companies are suffering billions in losses from the disruption of international trade and are repatriating supply chains. This re-shoring, as it is known, had already been happening before Covid, as wages have risen in China, making manufacturing there less attractive.Apple canrsquot market its new phones because of disruption to factories in China. It canrsquot rely on foreign sweatshop labour any more because the sweatshops are going to be transformed to combat the disease.But the pandemic has added yet another dimension to it. There is huge uncertainty about when andborders will relax. It is beginning to look aswe may have economic disruption until a vaccine is found, and even after that.This is why Mr Trumprsquos much-criticised travel ban makes a great deal of sense from his nationalistic, America First, politics. The Presidentrsquos Twitter rants seem arbitrary, contradictory, callous and unthinking. And they are. But they are also politically astute.The Democrats have got themselves into a mess by attacking Mr Trumprsquos border closures. They accused him of racism when he banned flights from the European Union back in February. And again today. But his voters only see him following the example of other countries.America is a vast country, with a erse economy providing most of what it needs from corn to cars. It could effectively shut the world out. Indeed, the US is arguably much better placed to do that than New Zealand because it can do without many of the imports other more open countries depend on.Here, SNP supporters argue that, since Scotlandrsquos death rate is currently running at around half of Englandrsquos, Ms Sturgeon should be following Jacinda Ardern and locking the border. There is immense frustration that Nicola Sturgeon appears to be dictated to by the UK Government.Health is devolved and the Scottish NHS could have pursued a dferent policy. However, as this column has repeatedly pointed out, the Scottish Government is following the same scientic advice as England. There is no evidence that Ms Sturgeon would have followed a dferent course had Scotland been independent.But social media is echoing to demands to lock foreigners out of Scotland for safetyrsquos sake. Ms Sturgeon is an internationalist and will never do that. But the resurgence of nationalism across the world is making borders ever more important to voters.

Up until then, the UK Government had given out very mixed messages. It allowed international sports fixtures to go ahead, allowing , fans from virus-hit Madrid to come to watch Liverpool play on March . It allowed racingrsquos Cheltenham Festival to go ahead from March -. It stopped contact tracing on March  with no apparent strategy to replace it.Between March  and , the hospital death rates were doubling every two-to three days. On March , Boris Johnson gave a speech which advised people to socially distance and not go to pubs and restaurants. Schools remained open. Although a section of the community took this advice, public transport was still very crowded, people were still going out, and on the following weekend, we saw thousands of people flocking to beauty spots across the country. Obviously the message that Mr Johnson had given was not understood and did not have the intended effect and transmission was still occurring to a great extent.Finally, on March , the present lockdown was announced. If this had been done a week previously, as in Germany, Austria and other places, our death and infection rates would be up to a quarter of those at present. With a doubling rate of three days, simple mathematics shows that in a week, the infections will quadruple. If the present lockdown had been announced a week earlier, a lot of our present problems would not be as great. There would be less need for PPE, intensive care beds and mortuaries. The lockdown would not be required as long as the virus would not have infected as much of the community. The economy would perhaps be less affected.A few weeks ago Professor Jason Leitch was talking about achieving herd immunity in an interview on BBC Scotland. Todayit has been reported that the WHO estimates only two to three per cent of the population is infected. It has also been suggested that having had Covid- does not guarantee immunity. This should hopefully stop any suggestion that we should allow successive waves of infection until we build up herd immunity.The Scottish Government needs to organise testing in the community and contact tracing so that we can ease the lockdown and keep the virus under control. The suggestion that this could start off in the more easily-isolated areas of the country seems a good idea. The Scottish Government should not be waiting for a ided, leaderless UK Government Cabinet to make a decision.Rob Evans, Dundee DD.IT is vital that the Scottish Government follows the advice from Neil Mackay. Health issues are devolved to the Scottish Government andNicola Sturgeon is unable to draw up regulations appropriate for the conditions which pertain in Scotland then that does call into question how Scotland could operate as an independent country. The Scottish Government must show that it is capable of governing the country in a distinct and appropriate manner.The regulations in all four home countries appear to have been cut and pasted from the same source. As an initial response that was quite acceptable, especiallythe source document has originally come from the World Health Organisation or the regulations imposed in another European country. However, now that the regulations have been in force for a month the four home countries need to develop their own regulations. The lower population density in Scotland presents both opportunities and challenges. The easy option is to follow Boris Johnson and then claim a big boy did it and ran away.Sandy Gemmill, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay has deemed Boris Johnsonrsquos approach to the coronavirus pandemic as a ldquodisaster and has urged Nicola Sturgeon to ldquobreak away. Ms Sturgeon has been at pains to stay more or less aligned to the Westminster approach, so far, which is to her credit, but deviation can only be sensiblethe course ahead is definite.All politicians will make mistakes over this new and uncharted coronavirus outbreak, it is inevitable, and sadly lives are always subject to such political judgments. At this stage no one can be sure about most of the answers but what is terribly obvious is that this whole episode has exposed the fragilities of Scottish independence. Just look at the oil price situation for example, hence Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire not to be out on a limb for fear of it breaking, and rightly so. It will not please some nationalists but we are definitely better together at this point in time and our First Minister seems to be aware of this fact.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IT is almost impossible to try to make sense of Neil Mackayrsquos article in a non-political perspective. First, no one can at this stage know what the result of the UK Government strategy will be. His criticism based on personalities is hardly factual. The main thrust of his argument that the Scottish Government should take a dferent approach is confusing, as there has been nothing to stop it doing so up to now presumably it believes the UKrsquos approach to be correct. Mr Mackay now needs to inform us in detail what detailed steps we should take in Scotland that are dferent.Colin McKay, Newton Stewart.THE UK Government has been on the receiving end of criticism from people and organisations across the political spectrum for its handling of some of the UK manestations of the Covid- pandemic.In particular, when the decision was announced in the last week or so in March, that the country would enter a period of lockdown which brought the economic le of the country to a juddering halt, there was comment that this action should have been taken seven,  or even more days earlier, and perhaps it should have. However, I wonderthe decision to postpone the onset of lockdown was made for very pragmatic reasons.Scroll back six or seven weeks or so, and we were being regaled on an almost daily basis in both print and broadcast media of y queues of people with trolleys waiting for supermarkets to open, and some time later, leaving these emporiums with trolleys stacked high with toilet rolls, kitchen paper, rice, pasta, part-baked bread rolls and other non-perishable goods, stripping the shelves bare in the process.Despite repeated pleas from civic, political and religious leaders, and the supermarket chains themselves, this activity continued for many days. I would imagine that, when introducing a new policy, particularly one which imposes considerable new restrictions, ministers and their advisors would consider what would be the likelihood of the target population co-operating with these new impositions, andimprobable, what scale of resources and expenditure would be required to compel and maintain their compliance.Given the response to the appeal for shoppers to revert to the pattern of purchasing that they had found perfectly adequate in the last week of January, the Government probably felt that it would have little chance of persuading the general population to accept much more drastic restrictions, at least until it had been persistently exposed to the carnage taking place in Italy and Spain. Even then, there were a signicant number of so-called Covidiots who seemed intent on defying any attempt to curb their liberty.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.THE language of war and battles to fight the coronavirus must stop.Language is a powerful tool. It can be used to both praise and demonise but either way it has an effect of on people, their wellbeing, their mental health. However, just as important as the adverse or positive effect that language can have on us as iniduals, words are also capable of shaping the public narrative to convince us what to think. Using war language to fight a health crisis is not helpful for at least three main reasons.The first is that it undermines legitimate challenge which, when it is absent, encourages systemic negligence to run rampantly unchecked.Secondly, it lulls us to uncritically accept the inevitability of thousands upon thousands of deaths, especially enabling the expendability of the costly, most vulnerable people in our society.Thirdly, war language demands sacrice and a culture of silence. This expectation is unnecessary, unwanted, and unhelpful it is anti-democratic and smacks of political expediency.All of these impacts are worrying and serves only as power and compliance tools for our political governors. Frontliners are workers, consistently undervalued ones, granted, but they are not warriors and they deserve the best protection. In light of this, more, many more questions need to be asked and answered.Why were we not prepared for this  Why are so many people dying compared to countries like Germany  Why are so many people dying in our care homes  Why are we demanding that our friends and family work on the frontline without full and proper protection for themselves and their patients  Why is there no urgency or recognition of the need to test and track Finally, in this modern Scotland, is it too much to ask to be treated like adults and receive honest answers in this bumbling, post-truth political world Councillor Brian McGinley , Ayr.I AM one of those people who go out every Thursday at pm to say thank you to all those dedicated people who are putting their lives and those of their families at risk to save others. I am, however, disappointed that the only references made regarding the Police Service are of issuing fines and heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the public in these dficult times.Their job is dficult enough and there is always a fine balance between discretion and enforcement.

There they sat in the Commons chamber, the carpet marked with black and yellow hazard tape as a guide to social distancing. Benches blocked off with plywood. Parliament looking even more like one giant building site.The Scottish Parliament, modern and therefore more adaptable, was slightly smarter when it ed on Tuesday after recess. Fty seats had been removed from the chamber, making the place look even airier.At Westminster yesterday the first virtual Prime Ministerrsquos Questions, or VPMQsyou must, took place. With the PM convalescing at Chequers, the new Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer making his debut, and the leader of the SNP in the Commons beaming in from his constituency of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, it was a dear diary day.: Government criticised for being slow to actSir Keir and Dominic Raab, First Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary, standing in for Boris Johnson, began by jabbing politely at each other like the lawyers they are. The Labour leader asked about the Governmentrsquos continuing failure to get anywhere near its own target of , tests a day. Mr Raab tried to turn the focus on the number of tests that could be done, rather than how many were being carried out. Sir Keir, thinking on his feet, picked up on this and came right back at the First Secretary of State. Just for a second, Mr Raab looked rattled.This was the cut and thrust of parliamentary democracy as it should be. Sir Keir also managed to secure that all-important sound bite for social media, in this case about the Government being ldquoslow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment.There were obvious problems, the lack of atmosphere most of all. The place was almost as empty as the average high street. Technical glitches occurred. ldquoDavid Mundell wersquove been unable to connect, announced the Speaker in sombre tones. Was the computer switched on, Mr M  Conservative MP Peter Bone was cut off midway through a rant on banks. SNP leader Ian Blackford used the occasion to punt the idea of a universal basic income perhaps not the most pressing concern of the day.Sir Keir missed a trick in not asking the Foreign Secretary about the UKrsquos involvement, or lack of it, in EU schemes to procure ventilators and protective equipment.: Building industry calls for supportIt was a Foreign Office official, after all, who told a Commons committee it had been a ldquopolitical decision not to take part, though he later said there had been a misunderstanding. Too messy for Sir Keir to raise, or did it not fit in with his ldquoconstructive opposition approach PMQs were a little rough round the edges, then, but it will get better. The crucial thing is that MPs and MSPs are back at work. They have been missed. Recent months have been a stress test for democracy as much as they have been for the operation of the NHS. Cracks have begun to show, and nowhere more so than in holding government to account.But we have the daily pm briefings at Number , do we not  No Scottish Six, but here is your Downing Street Five. To think the British press used to envy their American counterparts and the daily White House briefings on camera. So much more accountability and transparency. If only we could have our very own CJ Cregg from the West Wing instead of an anonymous bod who goes by the name of ldquoa Downing Street spokesperson.Except it has not worked out like that. The White House pressers are still going strong, and in their own way are providing a vital insight into a presidency. Americans are at once enthralled and appalled by their commander-in-chief.Back in Downing Street, meanwhile, we continue to slog through the motions of the  orsquoclock briefing. Up pops the Minister of the day followed by the experts. After the now ritual statement and reading of the graphs we switch to the screen for journalists to ask questions that are routinely swerved.Much of the problem is caused by journalists not being in the room. As any interviewer will tell you, there is a world of dference between talking to someone in person, and speaking to them at one remove.: Charity demands actionIn person you can look them in the eye, read their responses, adapt the questioning. An interview conducted via video call is almost as bad as one by phone ndash worse, possibly, because landlines tend not to have technical hitches.If it is possible for people to be in the same place in the Commons, at Holyrood, and in the White House briefing room, why canrsquot a small band of journalists take it in turns to attend the Downing Street press conference in person Politicians have a particular and crucial role to play when it comes to holding the executive to account. It is easy to sneer at your average backbencher or committee. What do they do all day  Why do they take so long to produce a report  How much more effective, as we saw during Brexit, to go through the courtsyou want something done.Yet the courts are not plugged into the community in the same way as politicians. MPs and MSPs see and hear what is happening on the ground, and in some instances they are better placed to get answers. Their role as advocates will become even more important as the months go by and le becomes harder for people. Many citizens are going to be coming into contact with the state as never before, and they will need help from those who know their way around.From the expenses scandal to Brexit, recent decades have not been the best of times for politicians. Now they have a chance to redeem themselves.There is a sense of drt in the country at the moment. People are stunned. Fearful of what is coming next. While no-one has all the answers it is time to start asking more questions with greater urgency, and politicians have a front line role to play in that.

The results will help scientists and the Government in the ongoing response to the coronavirus outbreak, with initial findings expected to be available in early May.Led by the Department for Health and Social Care and the Office for National Statistics, the study will draw on the world-leading scientic expertise of the University of Oxford, backed by the proven testing capabilities of data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes. No cost of the study has so far been given.ldquoUnderstanding more about the rate of Covid- infection in the general population and the longer term prevalence of antibodies is a vital part of our ongoing response to this virus, said Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary.ldquoThis survey will help to track the current extent of transmission and infection in the UK while also answering crucial questions about immunity as we continue to build up our understanding of this new virus.ldquoTogether, these results will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict the future trajectory and inform future action we take, including crucially the development of ground-breaking new tests and treatments, he added.Participants will provide samples taken from self-administered nose and throat swabs and answer a few short questions during a home visit by a trained health worker.

Blood will not be taken in any households where someone has symptoms of Covid- or is currently self-isolating or shielding.The trained study health workers will use all the recommended precautions to protect themselves and everyone in the household from getting the virus.

Irsquove spoken to one or two of them and, while some are more cautious than others, many believe they could safely re-open now and common sense says theyrsquore right.Garden centres, for example. I spoke to Adam McGowan, the general manager of McLarenrsquos Nurseries near Barrhead, and he told me a bit about how theyrsquove been affected by the crisis. The staff at the nursery spend years nurturing their stock, but under lockdown some plants have had to be dumped, others may not survive much longer, and anyone whorsquos a gardener will know how that feels. Itrsquos gutting, says Adam.The business model has also come under huge pressure. McLarenrsquos are still taking some orders over the phone while the nursery itself is closed to the public, and their drivers are doing  to  drops a day. But therersquos no way deliveries can replace the business they would have had: there are lots of customers who canrsquot get what they want and the business is losing potential profit.The thing is: therersquos no reason for it to go on like this. McLarenrsquos, and other businesses like it, could re-open tomorrow. Indeed, a handful of bigger BQs have reopened with social distancing in place.Therersquos plenty of space at the McLarenrsquos site ndash more than  acres ndash but even smaller garden centres usually have plenty of space and big aisles. They could also, as supermarkets have done, introduce a one-way system and put up signs to remind people of social distancing.Following the same principles, there are other businesses that could open right away: DIY stores, bike shops, car dealers, even museums and book shops, provided of course they had an upper limit on customers. Not only would it apply a couple of spark plugs to the economy, it would be good for the mental wellbeing of the people stuck at home % of the time. And, although it might seem counter-intuitive, allowing people to go out to buy plants and DIY supplies would also encourage them to stay at home more by giving them things to do while theyrsquore there.Not every business thinks this way, of course. I spoke to the owner of the hardware store, Timbermills in Cumnock, and he was cautious about re-opening. Like everyone , hersquos lost trade, but he thinks re-opening too soon would end up costing more money in safety measures, PPE equipment for staff, and so on. Hersquos also concerned customers coming back to the shop might lead to another spike in the virus, another lockdown and an even bigger hit to profits.Then there are the businesses who feel that even being allowed to re-open would not help at this stage. Shaun Bythell, who owns The Bookshop in Wigtown, has seen positive signs in other countries ndash in Italy and Austria bookshops and garden centres were among the first to reopen. But he says the majority of his customers are retired, which means theyrsquod be self-isolating anyway evenhe did re-open.And it doesnrsquot end there: therersquos the added worry that the moment restrictions are lted, Shaunrsquos business would no longer be eligible for government assistance ndash not that hersquos received a penny so far. As for his assessment of the future of the bookshop, itrsquos suitably literary ndash he is, he says, ldquoin blood stepped in so far, ing were as tedious as go orsquoer. Macbeth, Act , Scene .Listening to Shaun talk about his experiences isnrsquot easy, but other businesses that do feel that they could reopen safely should be allowed to do so. Adam at McLarenrsquos told me the nursery could reopen tomorrow and do it safely and he believes the vast majority of garden centres are in the same situation.So let them do it, and the shovers, draggers and nudgers will do their thing. The shovers will push the limits but will be forced to obey the rules on social distancing. The draggers will stay at home for quite a bit longer. And the nudgers will get out and start shopping and feeling normal again. The point is that we cannot stay like this for much longer. We need the first relaxation, the first let-up, the first nudge.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Within Scotland there are, after all, wide iations, for example National Records Scotland reports that, up till April  NHS Grampian, population ,, had  Covid- deaths, or  per million, and Greater Glasgow and Clyde, population .m, , or  per million, almost three times as many and nearer Londonrsquos  per million.Similar wide iations occur across the UK, so I can understand Nicola Sturgeon and the UK Government considering dfering approaches on lockdown and resourcing that are regional or situation based, but why Scotland vs rUK What astounds me is the attempts to blame it all on politicians, and UK politicians at that. Undoubtedly there have been screw-ups, but little is made of the Herculean efforts to build the Nightingale hospitals, including one in Glasgow that will probably not be needed, arguably because the politiciansrsquo, expertsrsquo and NHS strategies and efforts are working.On Channel  last night , Professor Dame Anne Glover, the Glasgow-based former scientic adviser to the EU, opined that experts had been advising on the basis that this was a flu epidemic, did not advise lockdown earlier than it was carried out, and did not strongly propose mass testing.Tellingly, she said it is the expertsrsquo job to advise the politicians, but that politicians do not always want to hear. But in the case of Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon they have by and large been following a strategy based on their expertsrsquo advice.Who can imagine either leader attempting to force us into a lockdown that the estimable Jason Leitch, for example, said wasnrsquot yet required, and in the face of public and press outrage Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.HAVING watched the excruciating performance of UK Heath Secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday eveningrsquos Downing Street briefing, I feel that I must agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed in Neil Mackayrsquos article .Surely the present UK Cabinet must be one of the most incompetent on record. Despite the Tory Party being in government now for some  years it is utterly depressing that the leadership of the UK is so manestly weak. It is tragic that a time of such national crisis we look in vain for Government ministers who can at least give a much-better impression that they know what they are doing. Instead the last few weeks have been characterised by missed opportunities, strategic mistakes, confusion, a failure to learn from the experience of others and a chronic inability to be honest with the public. I would absolve the Scottish Government from this criticism. Of course there have been mistakes and problems, but at least they are being tackled with an honesty and transparency sadly lacking where.What a contrast with New Zealand. In todays edition you quote Helen Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Aucklandwho very succinctly summarises the misery being endured in the UK. ldquoThe countryhas managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that had hampered the response in many other placeshellipNew Zealand got everything righthellipdecisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody. What a contrast with Westminster.A glance at the membership of Boris Johnsonrsquos Cabinet helps explain why the UK is in such a dreadful situation with a shockingly high death rate. Mr Johnson has surrounded himself with a team of sycophantic young Brexiters with virtually no track record of successful ministerial responsibility. His vindictiveness on taking office has seen most of the Tories of experience and ability such as Jeremy Hunt, languishing on the back benches or, like Dominic Grieve, driven out of politics altogether. It is not decisive leadership on the part of the UK Government that is pulling us through. Rather it is the hard work, dedication and sacrices of the devoted members of our NHS together with all those others support and care workers who are doing their best at great risk to their safety and emotional well-being.Eric Melvin, Edinburgh EH.I WOULD have thought thatthe Tory Party had any real sense of duty to the British public it would have invited the experienced Theresa May back into power as acting PM while Boris Johnson is hors de combat. I doubt, however, she would accept, having been stabbed in the back by the very same people.The one good thing about the Covid- pandemic is that for the generation to come at least, the records of the time-line from the initial whistleblowing of Dr Li Wenliang until we find ourselves back to normality will be embedded in their psyche. We will not, I pray, have to require drills and exercises between pandemics, as next time we will be fully prepared. Wonrsquot we What will be the date we stop clapping frontline staff every Thursday evening  I understand that Mr Johnson likes to quote the ancient Greek historian Thucydides. He would be better referring to Bertolt Brecht, who said: ldquoUnhappy the land that is in need of heroes. Thank goodness we still have so many ordinary people who can become valiant and heroic. The ordinary people of the UK have shone while our leaders have proved wanting.It is, however, a lesson in preparedness that only  years after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles to formally end the ldquowar to end wars we were at war with Germany yet again. It is within the grasp of humanity to learn nothing.Questions have to be asked, therefore,the World Health Organisation has the power and capacity to effectively force the containment of another such viral outbreak to within its own zone  Perhaps there is the need for a newly-drafted international health treaty with robust penalties on all nations where they fail to act decisively and swtly.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.IT is clear that this country will be facing immense economic and social challenges throughout the years ahead. There is already a widespread recognition that much has to be done in order to restore public expenditure to a level appropriate for any enlightened country. For instance, no longer must those essential workers we celebrate each Thursday evening be refused decent levels of remuneration. No longer can we be indferent to the consequences of  years of austere Conservatism for those at the margins of society referred to by David J Crawford in his letter of  April.There needs to be a debate on the redistribution required to create a far less unequal society. That means that those of us who are in receipt of generous salaries and pensions must face up to the consequences for us of any such redistribution. This is not only a matter of sourcing the resources needed. It is a matter of demonstrating that we, the more fortunate, must admit that our relative prosperity is dficult to justy while child poverty, being one example among so many, is such a scandal.I quote the recent words of the Bishop of Kensington. We must ldquolearn the capacity to sacrice our own desires for the sake of the wider community, recognising that ldquomaybe coronavirus is giving us a crash course in a dferent moral universe ndash one that might just be the saving of us.John Milne, Uddingston.I WORK in construction in England and have done for four years due to the lack of work in Scotland: in England and Wales with the exception of TFL Projects in London, all construction work is still ongoing, builders merchants and manufacturing companies which closed initially have all now re-opened and operating sites have re-written their safe systems of work to ensure they are working safely within the Governments guidelines on social distancing, as is the case in Europe in Spain, Germany and Sweden as an example.In Scotland this industry is currently at a standstill unless it is essential work the construction of the Louisa Jordan hospital is one example. How come this pound million project was delivered safely while all other construction work in Scotland is on lockdown A lot of construction work can be achieved with simple social distancing measure Ts. so why is the Scottish Government not looking to give this industry the same advice and support issued by the UK Government his would be one industry that could start to support the Scottish economy immediately as well as many of the self employed who will not benefit from the UK Governments wages support schemes. The last thing the Scottish workforce needs now is further contraction of an already seriously diminished market.On whose advice is the First Minister basing her Governments guidance when the industry is operating normally everywhere  John McWilliams, Coatbridge.THERE appears to be growing unease in some countries about the part played by the Chinese government in allowing the initial spread of coronavirus.The US state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government for \"lying to the worldrsquorsquo and \"silencing whistle-blowers\". The Chinese Embassy in Australia has accused Aussie politicians of joining in US orchestrated anti-Chinese rhetoric.The last thing the world needs at the moment is a witch hunt and blame-pinning exercise, but anyone following events from the start would, I am sure, agree that the Chinese authorities have at the very least serious questions to answer.At the end of the present nightmare, a thorough investigation is needed and lessons learned.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service. I welcome that assurance and hope it will allow access to justice for more people in Orkney, and where in Scotland, who need it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

In addition, recreational flying should not take place below  feet in the air space immediately around the airfields.The restrictions are in place to slow the spread of COVID- infection, save lives and protect the NHS.Brian Archibald, OIC’s head of marine services, engineering and transportation, said: “Higher risk recreational activities such as flying, yachting or mountaineering are actively discouraged and could be regarded as irresponsible during the pandemic.“In the event of an accident, the emergency and services and NHS could face considerable added pressure at a time when so much effort is going into the local and nationwide response to COVID-.”The airfields were reportedly used without prior permission being sought.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in .

Prof Pennington said the Western Isles, which at the start of the week had only six confirmed cases of Covid-, could exit the restrictions as a “test-bed” before wider lockdowns were lted.Politicians said the idea was worth considering, but still carried risk.Prof Pennington said: #There could soon be a case for a geographical lting of restrictions # such as in some of the Scottish islands and the Highlands and Grampian.#The Western Isles and Orkney are the obvious candidates to be the test beds for an exit strategy for the country. Travel is restricted because they are islands and have extremely low levels of confirmed cases. You can control access to them and re-open things like shops and churches etc and get back gradually to normal le again.#As for people travelling to the islands it is to be remembered that the vast majority of people have not been affected.”He added that effective testing facilities, which would give a quick result, must first be in place to allow any restrictions to be eased.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said that while the idea had merit, islanders would be alarmedthey felt their health was being compromised as part of an experiment.He said: #It is unfortunate that the language of ‘testbeds’ has been used by some to describe the Western Isles, which has disturbed a number of people who have contacted me about this subject.“We have a population that is more elderly and more vulnerable to this virus than most, and so slowing down the spread of the virus has to be our overriding priority.“Despite the fact we have a low number of confirmed cases, the true number of infected islanders is likely to be signicantly higher. There is certainly now a need for more testing locally.#We need to keep observing the social distancing guidelines and cannot allow any room for complacency.“Given that we may well be behind the infection curve for the rest of Scotland, there is a good case to be made for a regional approach to lting lockdown restrictions, when that happens. However, this also has to ensure that the islands are not subject to any influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has already peaked.”Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Donald Cameron added: “Any proposal to trial a relaxation of the lockdown rules must have the full support of local residents with the protection of the most vulnerable remaining paramount, as well as ensuring the NHS is not put under any unnecessary strain.“However, the geography of the islands means they are suitable for a possible trial and Professor Pennington’s suggestions certainly deserve serious consideration.“Given the fragile nature of the islands# local economy at this time, we need to give our communities every chance of not only getting through this pandemic but also kick-starting a recovery as quickly as possible. This proposal may well help in that endeavour.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/grimsay.jpg","title":"grimsay boat haven virtual launch replaces scheduled weekend of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA video has been made to launch the new boat haven in Grimsay after lockdown procedures forced original plans to change.Grimsay Community Association had originally planned a two-day extravaganza of events and activities over the Easter weekend to celebrate the launch of the new Grimsay boat haven.Unfortunately, current travel restrictions and social distancing meant that this could not go ahead.Organisers say that as soon as it is allowed and practicable they will be organising a celebratory event at the new haven. includes a virtual tour of the boats that are on display.

I#m agreeing with you, Piers, I think it#s dreadful that we can#t get more people tested, Mr Lewis replied.That#s why it#s important we do upscale the ability for people to access these tests both with more test centres, the ability to have the tests at home and the ability to apply for them directly rather than having to apply through their employer, which has been slowing things down.The government has promised to increase testing to , people a day by the end of the month.The target is still to do , tests a day, Mr Lewis insisted.On Thursday Mr Lewis told the BBC that he believed Sinn Fein#s Declan Kearney may be reading too much into newspaper reports after he suggested that right wing elements in the UK Government and some unionists were in favour of easing lockdown measures to benefit the economy.Mr Kearney said that some politicians were willing to put corporate greed over public welfare.At a meeting of the Conservative Party#s powerful  committee of backbench MPs on Wednesday a number of MPs expressed concern at the damage the lockdown is causing to the economy.The Northern Ireland Secretary said he believed protecting the economy and public health were not mutually exclusive.

I wouldn’t rule anything in or out, he told the Impartial Reporter in a video interview on Tuesday. “But the challenge with having iations within Northern Ireland is around the messaging. We all understand the messaging of stay at home and save lives… every reader of yours, every resident who has stayed at home and has followed the guidelines has directly helped to save a le and protect the NHS’ ability to look after people. That has been hugely important.“The challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how you manage that, how you message that. I think it’s unlikely, but I wouldn’t rule it out. In a practical sense I think it’s quite unlikely. Asked when restrictions could be lted, Mr Lewis said: “The short answer is I don’t know”.“We are going to do a review in three weeks’ time. The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. It’ll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence,” he said.I think it’s unlikely to be dferent within Northern Ireland, it’s not impossible. I wouldn’t rule anything in or out. NI Secretary Brandon LewisMr Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Ireland’s border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Tanaiste Simon Coveney.“Even where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there. “The challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.”An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government “missed the boat on testing and PPE”and “just watched” as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China. The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial Cobra meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr Lewis said: “I didn’t recognise some of what I saw in the Times”.“I was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. It’s a place, not a thing.“We were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.”The challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that. NI Secretary Brandon LewisTurning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been “no problems” with accessing equipment.He added: “We’ve had gowns sent over to the UK, O’Neills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.“We’re shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. We’ve been able to supply that it’s in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.”Mr Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure “we don’t hit the second peak” of the virus.“One of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown – restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again – and suddenly you have to close down again and that’s not viable.“I think it’s right to be cautious about this we’ll make that decision in a few weeks. “The science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeks’ time.”He believes the government could “flatten the curve” of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: “We want to see past the peak, you don’t want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.”“If you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be.

Mr McGowan said the classes will be extended to other streets in Creggan over the weekend because the response has so positive.He added: This has really struck a chord with everyone. We have children doing squats and a woman at  years of age out jogging on the spot outside her front door.It is creating a great buzz around the streets. A lot of people aren#t getting out for the hour#s exercise they are permitted so it is giving them a safe space to do that.These are properly qualied instructors who are coming into the streets and leading them in a structured routine that is also a bit of craic and a bit of fun.They arrive with a PA, system, a cordless mike - they put the music on and away they go for half an hour.We are mindful as an organisation about the guidelines around gathering crowds so that is why this works so well because people are staying in their own gardens.

The items were collected by the group, who are one of the those involved in the Strabane Together Against Covid- organisation. They offered their centre as a donation point, and several generous local residents and businesses answered the call in donating hundreds of items, worth approximately pound,. Mayor Boyle said she was absolutely delighted to join the group in handing over the donations at the Western Trusts drop-off point at the UA Foyle building in Gransha. googletag.cmd.push I want to say a huge well done to Lynn Maguire, Mary Deery, and all at Fountain Street Community Association for their contribution in the organising and supporting of the Altnagelvin Covid- appeal for non-perishable items. Yesterday I joined members of the association and along with the assistance of Strabane Community Search  Rescue we delivered a signicant number of much-needed items to the drop off depot.A representative of the hospital who met with us was overwhelmed and paid tribute to the generosity of the people of Strabane for their kind donations, which will go a long way in helping both patients and staff within the Western Trust. googletag.cmd.push I am heartened but not surprised at the kindness and support shown by the folk of Strabane in this time of crisis. The people of the town have suffered their own hardships down through the years, but nothing on this scale. And yet, the unity and the responsiveness of everyone coming together in a compassionate and caring way has been second to none. People reaching out to those most in need is exactly how we can overcome this pandemic together.

Redmond McFadden has written to the First and deputy First Minsters and Health Minister Robin Swann this week asking the Executive to bring forward a decision on the Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee to ensure it can open to new students in September . The establishment of a Medical School at Magee in Derry is a core commitment within the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ Agreement which led to the restoration of the Executive in January. googletag.cmd.push Redmond McFadden, President of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School in the city has long been promised for the North West. Its importance, however, has been made even clearer in light of the COVID- crisis. By training and retaining new doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers locally, we can signicantly bolster Northern Ireland’s healthcare workforce and ease pressures on our health service. “A medical school in the North West would not just have signicant benefits for our health service but also for our regional economy. It has also been identied as a core capital project of the Derry and Strabane City Deal. An increase in students in the city would lead to an economic boost and a more highly-skilled local labour force would be a key economic driver for the entire region. googletag.cmd.push “Our health service is under extreme strain at the moment and our health and social care workers are undertaking huge efforts to keep us safe. Delivering a Graduate Entry Medical School in the North West would be a fitting legacy to the efforts of our frontline healthcare staff. I am urging the Executive to deliver on its commitment, bring forward a decision on the medical school, and urgently consider establishing the school to strengthen our health service and boost our regional North West economy.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Teresa’s son Joseph O’Kane was involved in the show and admits that the production would certainly not have happened in the current era. “It wouldn’t be too politically correct now,” he told the County Derry Post. “She had to get black and white dye out of some theatrical place in Belfast. Everybody was blackened up with white eyes.

A spin-off stage show also played for a decade at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, before going on tour to Australia and New Zealand. It courted controversy, however, when it was accused of racism and ethnic stereotyping by anti-racist groups in the UK due its use of the theatrical make-up known as ‘blackface’. From the boardwalks of London, the local production in rural south Derry proved a hit from the moment it debuted at St Patrick’s Hall in Castledawson on October , . googletag.cmd.push  The hall itself was built in  after local businessman Patrick Convery donated land on New Row and was used by both parish and club until it was rebuilt as St Patrick’s Church in . “They went round all the local clubs – Glen, Slaughtneil, Swatragh, Kilrea, Bellaghy and Lavey and the rest,” recalls Joseph. “It was really good. They had a chorus of these black and white minstrels and girls and then they had a few solo artists and other groups.” Joseph remembers Frank Toner standing out as the star, closing the show with a stirring rendition of a well-known classic. “Frank was a cousin of my mother’s, a big, stout man, I remember him well,” he said. “He sang ‘Mammy’ by Al Johnson and was really good at it. He looked the part, but he was a referee as well. “I remember him refereeing one day in Claudy and there was a wee bit of a skirmish. I was playing at the time and he come up to me and says “Right Joe, what’s your name ” One set-piece from the show has caused Joseph no end of amusement throughout the years that followed. “There was a thing called the Tiny Tots,” he said. “My mother found all these cubs of three or four years of age. She had gathered up a kit for every county in Ireland. I don’t know how she did it, there were no O’Neill’s shops back then. “I don’t know whether she got someone to make all those jerseys, because I don’t think they did children’s jerseys back then in . “So as the wee lads came out dressed in whatever county it was, the chorus would have sung a verse of a song that would relate to that county. “I get grown men coming up to me when I’m out and telling me: “I remember being in the Tiny Tots – I was Wexford”. The Black and White Minstrel show was cancelled by the BBC in , but its  adaptation on the banks of the Moyola still brings fond memories to all who witnessed it.

Minus the suspended duo of Cathal O’Kane and Fergal Moore, it was always going to be an uphill task for the Derry side, who hadn’t lost since their defeat to Newtownstewart in the first game at the start of March. But against the strong breeze in the first half, they failed to score and Killybegs racked up seven first half points to give them a handsome lead going in at the break. Killybegs were quickest out of the blocks with Conal Molloy bagging a brace inside the opening ten minutes. Ciaran Tully then hooked over a huge effort from outside the forty to increase the dference out to three. googletag.cmd.push Conal Molloy then grabbed his third of the day from a free two minutes shy of the quarter hour mark. However, all that endeavour was nearly undone in one fell swoop. Lee Moore somehow managed to wriggle through at the town end, but found Killybegs netminder Anthony O’Hara equal to the task. Senior list Shane Boyle then strolled up from centre-half-back to split the posts and make it - to - with eight minutes of the first half remaining. And during the remainder, the impressive Ciaran Tully drilled over another two points to make it a seven point game. Concerns expressed by Manus Boyle during the half time interval as to whether his side had done enough, looked to be genuine, when Craigbane pegged on four quick-fire scores inside the opening ten minutes of the new half to cut the deficit to just three points. Lee Moore got the salvage operation under way before number eleven Gavin Conwell dissected the posts from distance with two fine frees and one point from play. Killybegs responded and defenders Ronan Boyle and David Conwell started to open their legs to give then zip on the flanks. googletag.cmd.push Man-of-the-match Ciaran Tully drove at the Craigbane defence to send Conal Molloy through to post, before firing over his fourth of the day just after the third quarter. And fittingly it was veteran Mark Boyle who finished the scoring for the victors after he had linked up superbly with Pauric Gallagher and Ciaran Tully. With the result well and truly in the bag the Donegal side took their foot of the gas and that allowed Craigbane to fire over a late consolation point through a Moore free.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Castledawson man Dean McErlean made the discovery while walking his dogs at the foot of the Moyola River, where it enters Lough Neagh. “It says ‘Joseph McManmoy’ on it,” he told the County Derry Post. “We would take the dogs down there for a walk and let them swim and we found it lying in the sand. It was half-buried but I saw the top of it. “It doesn’t look like a medicine bottle – it’s clear. I knew it was old glass because you could still see the bubbles in it, and it wasn’t symmetrical. googletag.cmd.push “I knew it was a good age, but I didn’t know what it was for, whether it was for whiskey or medicine or anything.” Dean then took to the internet to seehe could unearth any details about the mysterious ‘Joseph McManmoy’, but his search drew a blank. “The first thing I did was Google it, but there was absolutely nothing and no name the same. It’s not a usual name. “The name has thrown everybody that I have asked because it’s so unusual.” The search for any trace of the name is still ongoing, but Dean has ensured the bottle has found a safe home. googletag.cmd.push He said: “An aunty of mine is big into traditional, vintage, oddly shaped stuff. “She would have wee medicine bottles and stuff around the house, so I took it home to her. She loved it, she was like an excited child.” While his efforts to find Mr McManmoy have not yet proved fruitful, Dean has his own theory about how the bottle came to rest on the Loughshore. “I would say it has come down the Moyola and washed out in the floods over the wintertime. God knows how long it was lying somewhere .”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The bottle, bearing the name of ‘Joseph McManmoy’, was discovered by Dean McErlean where the Moyola River enters Lough Neagh and the unusual name had everyone stumped. After reading the County Derry Post report on the event, Magherafelt man Eugene Kielt got in touch to shed some light on the situation. He said: “The names McManmoy, McManmey and McManemie were older iants of a family name common in the west of Ulster and now standardised as ‘McMenamin’. googletag.cmd.push “In the official Register of Marriages for Magherafelt in  there is a Joseph McManemie of Magherafelt who married Eliza McGurk of Brackagh, S.Gallon at ‘Coolcam’, Desertmartin on  Sept . “The name ‘McManemie’ sounded similar to the name displayed on the bottle. When I then examined the name in the original church register, the groom’s name is given as ‘McManmey.” “Whilst it is dficult to see clearly whether the name on the bottle ends in ‘oy’ or ‘ey’ I would be confident that the Joseph McManmey who got married in Desertmartin in  was the same person whose name is on the bottle. googletag.cmd.push “Not only is the name similar, the time period fits too, for the bottle looks like it could have been produced a hundred or more years ago.”  The fact that McManmey’s name is embossed on a glass bottle hints at a man who was well ahead of his time when it came to business development. “During my research I discovered that Joseph McManmey was a publican,” explained Eugene, who, along with his we Gerardine, runs Laurel Villa Guest House  Tours in Magherafelt. “In those days local publicans would have had the name of their business stamped, embossed or added in some way to the bottles and jars of liquor they sold. “McManmey seems to have had an eye for marketing, dispatching his liquor in attractively branded bottles like the one which has just been found. “His bottles were obviously very durable too, going by this example that that has survived in perfect condition despite the ravages of time and nature. Joseph McManamey operated licensed premises and an undertakers on Rainey Street from around  until he died in . The business continued to operate until the s under the stewardship of his son Thomas John. An obituary in a local newspaper at the time described Joseph as ‘a man of the highest integrity and his genial temper, urbanity and affability made him a general favourite with all’ He is buried in Milltown graveyard in Magherafelt.

Friends of Africamembers are running km each day to accumulate a total of km, with Bellaghy’s Voice UK semi-finalist Brooke Scullion joining those pounding the tarmac. The initiative came about after the organisation were forced to shelve international work planned for the summer months in the wake of the coronavirus’ spread. Ciaran McShane said Friends of Africa had gone the extra mile this year and were looking forward to the summer. The Kilrea man told the County Derry Post: “This year for the first time we had taken the decision to invest in our membership. googletag.cmd.push “All our volunteers have been trained in accredited youth work training, which is the focus of our work in Africa. “When we, like everyone , were faced with the reality of the Covid- pandemic we decided to to postpone all our international work planned for June, July  August of this year. “It wasn’t an easy decision as months of training, fundraising and planning had been done but integrity, solidarity and the common good are values which are central to our mission.” With their efforts frustrated, the organisation looked to find a way to continue their fundraising efforts and support their partners and the communities in which they work. googletag.cmd.push “Shauna O’Neill, who has worked with Friends of Africa in South Africa, came up with the idea to run k a day for  days  – k to raise funds for our appeal,” said Ciaran. “Our members took up the challenge without much convincing and we have  people signed up to the challenge. It started on Saturday and has raised over pound, to date. “We are also delighted to have our x challenge being taken up by FOA members living in Thailand, Australia  New Zealand as well as by our partners in Ghana and South Africa. “This expression of solidarity is keeping us all going and reminds us that no matter how dficult it is for us here, living in poverty makes this much virus more deadly.” While lockdown is an inconvenience to many here, it is almost impossible in the conditions that are common in many areas where Friends of Africa work. “Once we began to understand how the virus works and the effect it was having in Europe we began to fear for the people and communities we work with across Africa,” said Ciaran. “How can you implement social distancing when you live in a squatter camp with , other people  How can you practice proper hygiene when you have no access to running water  “How can you stay at home and stay safe when you live hand to mouth and no work means no food on the table that evening  “This is the sad reality forhundreds of millions of people across the continent whose lives were already dficult because of poverty and inequalities made worse by the corona virus.” Donations to the x campaign can be made on the Just Giving page.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of . He was the GP in Tynan, Co Armagh, for  years.Dr Gillespie was one of the nicest men that I have ever met and was a long serving member of the Turf Club and IHRB.

He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland.

I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

I’ve done half marathons but never a full marathon.“The London Marathon is still going ahead in October, but I thought it would be nice to have something on that day to mark the day I would have done it.“The new date is two days after my wedding, hopefully it all still goes ahead.

Attempting to run  laps of the driveway outside his home in Islington, north London, Ryan is undertaking this challenge in response to local charities’ appeals for help during the pandemic: “I was sitting at home thinking, ‘what can I do ’ It’s devastating to think that all those local charities that do incredible work, day-in, day-out, are now finding themselves without the necessary funding unable to provide the vital services that they do. “Marie Curie, in particular, is a cause close to my heart, so I couldn’t bear to see them struggling. I walked outside and measured the distance between the top and bottom of our road which is .km. After some quick maths I realised  laps would equal the distance of a marathon.” The official London Marathon was due to take place this Sunday, however Ryan was not set to run the race himself: “I haven’t been training for the . miles distance – in fact, I’ve done zero training for this – which perhaps doesn’t leave me best prepared, but the thought of those in the care of the amazing Marie Curie nurses will spur me on, as will the memory of my mum and aunt Eileen.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusCountry and FarmingFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...Make sure your dog has a comfy bed or den, where they can relax in peace.Give them something fun to occupy them, such as a long-lasting treat or puzzle toy.While your dog is enjoying their treat, take a couple of steps to the other side of the room. If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If your dog stays where they are, wait a moment, then go back and reward them with an extra treat.Increase the distance you move away and the time you wait before ing with the extra treat. You should soon be able to leave the room and close the door or gate. Progress to spending more time in a dferent room. Build this into the daily routine.It’s important that your dog remains relaxed. If they show signs of distress, leave them for a shorter period, or don’t move as far away, next time.Rachel Casey, Director of Canine Behaviour and Research at Dogs Trust, said: “For many of us it has been great to spend so much time with our dogs during lockdown andmostly our dogs love us being around too. But all this extra attention could potentially create a ticking time bomb of separation anxiety for our dogs. If they expect us to be about all the time, it will be more dficult for them to cope once we go back to our normal lives and aren’t in the house  .“Now is the time to act to avoid future problems – and it’s easy to do. Just make sure that you factor in time apart from your dog each day to help them be able to cope when alone – this could be separated from you by a door or child gate for an hour or two whilst you’re working or home schooling the kids. By organizing your dog’s day, with time apart, play times, exercise, other activity sessionsand quiet times, you can make sure that your dog maintains their ability to cope with the dferent aspects of ‘normal’ le when we get back to it.”For more ideas on how to keep your dog occupied visit www.dogstrust.org.uk--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffbddbbcfb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceddceddb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
