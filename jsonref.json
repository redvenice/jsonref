Many are repeat offenders – including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd.Nine MPs have had their card suspended more than ten times over the past three years, including prominent Tory backbencher Damian Collins and constitution minister Chloe Smith.Other Cabinet ministers, or MPs who sit in Cabinet meetings, to have had their cards suspended include Stephen Barclay, Greg Clark, Chris Grayling, Robert Buckland, Claire Perry, Rory Stewart, Jeremy Wright and David Mundell.         They are among the 377 MPs to be penalised since 2015 for breaking the rules by not providing receipts or failing to pay back ineligible expenses.

The rest of the nation would only expect to have to comply in similar circumstances.’Parliamentary credit cards were introduced following the expenses scandal to ensure spending could be closely monitored.Sir Alistair said MPs have ‘clearly become lax’ and ‘casual in their approach in meeting the rules’.He added: ‘If MPs can’t deal with this rather narrow sphere of finances, why should we trust them in dealing with the nation’s finances?’A spokesman for Miss Rudd said: ‘Some payment deadlines were missed by the member of staff responsible for these matters. These issues were subsequently resolved.’A Labour spokesman said: ‘Our MPs’ offices rectify all such administrative issues as soon as they are identified.’Ruth Evans, Ipsa chairman, said: ‘Ten years ago, the difficulty of having politicians self regulate their pay and expenses became all too clear. It led to the establishment of Ipsa.‘Since then, Ipsa has established a clear set of rules for MPs to follow and enforced them fairly. The openness and transparency has become a model for legislatures worldwide.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/08/08/13232824-0-image-a-7_1557300198876.jpg","title":"Royal baby Meghan Markle early stages labour Kensington Palace says","story":"Share this articleLayer up like Meghan in a blue coat by SmytheBuy it at Harvey NicholsThe Duchess of Sussex launched a charity cookbook back in September last year, marking her first solo project as a fully-fledged member of the Royal Family.She looked as elegant as ever for the occasion, combining some of her favourite labels.

The price Eir charges for access to its poles and ducts was a major sticking point in the early part of the negotiations.The company insists its wholesale prices accurately reflect the costs involved and were agreed with the regulator Comreg.Procurement processEir had originally been favourite to win the NBP contract but controversially dropped out of the procurement process last year, citing commercial issues and complexities around the tender.Before it exited, it successfully convinced the Government to remove 300,000 homes originally earmarked for the plan, undertaking to service them itself as part of its own commercial rollout.However, the move was seen by many as cherry-picking the quasi-commercial part of the project.The Government’s decision to farm out nearly 40 per cent of the homes in the original intervention area has been one of the principal reasons why the cost of the scheme has ballooned to €3 billion, from an estimate of €1 billion as recently as 2016.Remote locationsThis is because the remaining homes left to be covered are located in the most remote locations, which increases the average per-unit connection costs, and ultimately the subsidy required by the likely operator, US investment firm Granahan McCourt.If the Government had opposed Eir’s move, it could have faced a legal challenge under EU state aid rules, which prevent governments from intervening in areas where commercial entities are willing to operate.It is understood that it will cost on average €1,000 to connect a premises to the new network but that National Broadband Ireland, the newly incorporated company set up to operate it, will only charge €100 to the retailers operating on the network in order to boost take-up.It will be up to each retailer whether they wish to pass this on to the customer.

Photograph: Saul LoebAFPGetty ImagesThe question of who is the most Irish contender in the race for the White House has set off a jovial debate among Democratic candidates running for the US presidency.And the issue might yet be resolved in traditional fashion: over a pint of Guinness.Joe Biden, the former US vice president and Democratic frontrunner, claimed that there was “only one real Irishman” in the 2020 race for the White House before declaring, “and it’s me.” The statement was taken by some on social media as a slight directed at at least four other candidates with Irish ancestry running for president in a crowded field of 21.They include former Maryland congressman John Delaney former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Ohio congressman Tim Ryan. Mr Delaney responded by challenging Mr Biden to settle the matter over a pint.“I’m sure there’s a civil way to figure this all out,” Mr Delaney tweeted on Tuesday. “Maybe over a pint of Guinness in Rehoboth, ” he added, directing his message at Mr Biden and referring to the seaside resort in the former vice president’s home state of Delaware. It all started at the weekend when a reporter for the Financial Times, the newspaper’s Washington bureau chief Demetri Sevastopulo - who is originally from Dublin - asked Mr Biden after a campaign event in South Carolina: “Can an Irishman get a question?” The approach worked, and in a video posted by Sevastopulo on Twitter, the journalist asked Mr Biden had he changed as a candidate over the years.“I’m still the same guy,” Mr Biden responded.As he was leaving the event, the US politician, who regularly talks with affection about his Irish roots, rolled down the window of his car and joked with the reporter in a moment not captured on camera: “The Irish guy? There’s only one real Irishman running for president, and it’s me.”Some supporters in Mr O’Rourke’s camp did not see the funny side to Mr Biden’s remark.“Beto has done nothing but praise Biden and this is what Biden says in return,” one Twitter user posted using the subject line “#Beto2020.”The former El Paso representative’s full name is Robert “Beto” Francis O’Rourke and his great-great-grandfather Bernard O’Rourke was born in Glencar, north Leitrim in 1830. Asked by Mr Sevastopulo on the campaign trail in March if he intended to celebrate St Patrick’s Day with a pint, Mr O’Rourke said he would “delegate the pint drinking to a friend,” before adding: “If in Ireland, you can count me in.”Another Twitter user named TxBlueBanshee referred to Mr Biden’s career-long weakness for gaffes. “Oh-why? I love Joe but that mouth. There is no reason to dis the other candidates that have Irish ancestry. I mean, what a waste of breath,” the user tweeted.

After the US withdrew from the accord it restored crippling sanctions on Iran, exacerbating a severe economic crisis.Iran sent letters on Wednesday on its decision to the leaders of the UK, China, the European Union, France and Germany via their ambassadors in Tehran. All were signatories to the nuclear deal and continue to support it.A letter also was given to Russia. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was meeting his Russian counterpart in Moscow.“If the five countries join negotiations and help Iran to reach its benefits in the field of oil and banking, Iran will return to its commitments according to the nuclear deal,” Mr Rouhani said.However, he warned of a “strong reaction” if European leaders sought to impose more sanctions through the UN Security Council. Mr Zarif issued his own warning from Moscow.“After a year of patience, Iran stops measures that US has made impossible to continue,” he wrote on Twitter. World powers have “a narrowing window to reverse this”.Mr Rouhani also said that if the 60 days pass without action, Tehran will halt a Chinese-led effort to redesign its Arak heavy water nuclear reactor. Such reactors produce plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons.There was no immediate response from the US. The White House said on Sunday that it would dispatch an aircraft carrier and a bomber wing to the Persian Gulf over what it described as a new threat from Iran.Tehran reached the deal with world powers in 2015. Western governments had long feared Iran’s atomic programme could allow it to build nuclear weapons. Tehran has always maintained its programme is for peaceful purposes.Under terms of the deal, Iran can keep a stockpile of no more than 300kg of low-enriched uranium, compared with the 10,000kg of higher-enriched uranium it once had.The US last week ended deals allowing Iran to exchange its enriched uranium for unrefined yellowcake uranium with Russia, as well as it being able to sell its heavy water to Oman. The US has also ended waivers for nations buying Iranian crude oil, a key source of revenue for Iran’s government.Currently, the accord limits Iran to enriching uranium to 3.67 per cent, which can fuel a commercial nuclear power plant. Weapons-grade uranium needs to be enriched to around 90 per cent. However, once a country enriches uranium to around 20 per cent, scientists say the time needed to reach 90 per cent is halved. Iran has previously enriched to 20 per cent. –AP"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignRoyal baby latest news: First picture of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s boy as world awaits name - live updatesFootage of London Bridge attack shown at inquests into the victims’ deathsBrexit latest news: Theresa May on collision course with Tory Eurosceptic MPs after ruling out resigning earlyRoyal baby Sussex first picture: everything we know about Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s baby boyMeghan Markle\u0026#39s family: from her diplomat uncle to cannabis-growing nephew, who will meet the royal baby boy?Comment: Corbyn should beware a huge Tory comeback once the party\u0026#39s leadership bloodbath is overComment: Westminster is playing into Nigel Farage\u0026#39s hands with its shabby approach to BrexitHome Office minister admits she does not know how many young people are at risk of knife crimeNicky Morgan had to install panic alarm and was unable to go out alone after threats from online troll, court hears Bikes to be prescribed on NHS for first time in attempt to improve health of overweight patientsMichel Barnier accuses Nigel Farage of lying during Brexit referendum campaignComment: Politics is totally gridlocked while Mrs May remains in charge.

It was this blockade which was to blame for Venezuelan suffering, Mr Arreaza claimed.These are resources of the Venezuelan people for their food, for their health, for their public services, for their housing, for their infrastructure, it\u0027s criminal what the United States is doing, he said. When a housewife can\u0027t get a product or it\u0027s more expensive, it\u0027s thanks to the blockade, When a child can\u0027t be operated on, it\u0027s thanks to the blockade, the foreign minister alleged.Mr Arreaza did not address why these funds had been erted overseas rather than used to met urgent needs at home prior to the sanctions introduced earlier this year. But he said Venezuela was now seeking help from allies such as China and Russia to create alternative routes ... to bypass the American blockade. The Bank of England in January denied Nicolas Maduro\u0027s request to withdraw the gold after the US lobbied for the regime to be cut off from its overseas assets amid the leadership standoff with Juan Guaidó. Mr Guaidó, the National Assembly leader who declared himself the constitutionally legitimate president on January 23, asked for the funds to be erted to him instead, though at present the assets are believed to remain frozen.The US imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in late January. Prior to that - aside from a 2017 ban on US loans to state oil company PDSVA and another in 2018 on the purchase of state debt - it had only targeted the assets of iniduals accused of siphoning off Venezuela\u0027s wealth or involvement in other criminal activity such as drug trafficking.Washington in March introduced sanctions on the state mining company, Minerven, which has been accused of acting as a front for the sacking of the country\u0027s vast resources of gold and other minerals in the Arco Minero (Mining Arc). Lawmakers and residents of the southern mining region have told The  of collusion between the Venezuelan army and armed criminal groups including Colombian guerrillas in the extraction of its mineral wealth.Sick, starving and seeking a better life: Venezuelan migrants\u0026#039 harrowing storiesThe International Crisis Group says that as oil production has declined in the South American nation, the Maduro government and the army has come increasingly reliant on the coveted revenue stream of illegal mining profits.The Maduro government and its supporters at home and overseas have long claimed that sanctions are the cause of Venezuela\u0027s woes, which independent observers instead say are the result of decades of economic mismanagement and corruption. The country\u0027s GDP has fallen by around 50 per cent since Mr Maduro took over from the late Hugo Chavez in 2013.In March, Mr Maduro claimed that days-long nationwide blackouts were the result of an electric war waged by the United States, despite previous warnings from electricity workers that the system was on the verge of collapse following years of deterioration and rolling power cuts.Caracas has consistently refused international offers of humanitarian assistance in recent years, even as more than 3.4 million people - more than 10 percent of the population - have fled the country, mostly to other Latin American or nearby Caribbean nations.Mr Maduro\u0027s government has been accused by groups such as Amnesty International of stepping up human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, since the leadership crisis began in January.Royal baby latest news: First picture of Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s boy as world awaits name - live updatesFootage of London Bridge attack shown at inquests into the victims’ deathsBrexit latest news: Theresa May on collision course with Tory Eurosceptic MPs after ruling out resigning earlyRoyal baby Sussex first picture: everything we know about Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s baby boyMeghan Markle\u0026#39s family: from her diplomat uncle to cannabis-growing nephew, who will meet the royal baby boy?Comment: Corbyn should beware a huge Tory comeback once the party\u0026#39s leadership bloodbath is overComment: Westminster is playing into Nigel Farage\u0026#39s hands with its shabby approach to BrexitHome Office minister admits she does not know how many young people are at risk of knife crimeNicky Morgan had to install panic alarm and was unable to go out alone after threats from online troll, court hears Bikes to be prescribed on NHS for first time in attempt to improve health of overweight patientsMichel Barnier accuses Nigel Farage of lying during Brexit referendum campaignComment: Politics is totally gridlocked while Mrs May remains in charge.

Earlier this week the High Pay Centre attacked big shareholders for failing to act on excessive boardroom payClick to followThe IndependentBritish Gas owner Centrica is at the centre of a row over boss Iain Conn\u0027s payIs Centrica’s annual meeting going to provide another example of the failure of big institutional investors to act on excessive pay?The owner of British Gas is coming off a thoroughly miserable year. It angered consumers by imposing price increases, issued a profit warning, and announced thousands of job cuts. The performance of the shares, meanwhile, was miserable.\u0026nbspDespite all this, CEO Iain Conn saw his overall packaging rising to £2.4m from £1.7m thanks to bonuses, including an annual award and a payout from the long term incentive plan the company gave him.\u0026nbspBritish Gas owner’s stock falls to 20-year low after warning on profitBritish Gas owner Centrica will cut 1,000 jobs this yearNeedless to say, the rise has come in for considerable criticism. The latest to take a shot at it is Pirc, the voting adviser, which has urged shareholders to vote down the remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.“The change in CEO total pay over five years is not commensurate with the change in TSR (total shareholder return) over the same period. Awards granted during the year under review were excessive at 250 per cent of salary,” it said in a report.\u0026nbspJust so. Quite how such a package can be seen as in any way in shareholders’ interests when shareholders\u0027 interests\u0026nbspin the company have so obviously been declining in value is beyond me.Pirc’s intervention is worth of note because it comes just a day after the High Pay Commission\u0026nbspsharply criticised Britain’s institutional investors for failing to curb excessive executive pay.\u0026nbspIt took a look at the rules that gave shareholders a veto on companies’ pay policy but failed to find an incidence of them actually using their power at a\u0026nbspFTSE 100 company.\u0026nbspOf 700 pay related resolutions in total, only 11 per cent attracted “significant” levels of dissent among 20 per cent or more of shareholders. Meanwhile, the median (most common) level of CEO pay in the FTSE reached £3.9m in 2017, 137 times that of the typical UK worker. Now you know why.\u0026nbspThe point about institutions is that they act as a proxy for you and me.

The catch is that the customer has to pay the fee regardless of whether their property is sold or not.\u0026nbspThe model has nonetheless rapidly gained traction in the UK, and the company’s successful marketing\u0026nbsprecently got it named on one of those “super brand” lists people like to put out.\u0026nbspLondon house prices fall at fastest pace since 2009Purplebricks founder and CEO Michael Bruce resignsPurplebricks to put its own house up for saleBut there’s nothing super about the way it has performed as an investment. Purplebricks joined the stock market at a quid in 2015 and backers\u0026nbspwere richly rewarded in the early days. The stock was touching a fiver within 18 months as investors got stars in their eyes over the plans by Bruce and his team to take the brand global.\u0026nbspBut the shares hit a bump in the road when stockbroker Jeffries last year issued a sharply critical research note, questioning the company’s sales success rates, and describing selling with it as “a £1,000 coin toss”, a reference to the fees which top that in London post codes.\u0026nbspThe broker argued the model hadn’t been sufficiently tested and claimed that the shares were priced for “perfection”.\u0026nbspThe latter part of that has proved prescient given the less than perfect performance the company has put in. Chairman Paul Pindar issued what can only be described as a grovelling apology to its investors in the latest update.\u0026nbsp“We are very conscious that the group’s performance has been disappointing over the last 12 months and we sincerely apologise to shareholders for that,” he said.\u0026nbspHowever, Purplebricks denies that there is any problem with the model per se.\u0026nbspPindar rather put the blame for the company’s issues on trying to go global too fast and making some bad investments, or, as he put it, “we have also made sub-optimal decisions in allocating capital”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It said its Twitter handle would go from being a reference to The Independent Group, its name until relatively recently, to ForChange_Now.When it moved its Twitter account, it took all of the followers and posts that had existed on that old handle with it. But it failed to register that old name, allowing anyone to use it – and very quickly someone, apparently enthusiastic about Brexit, did.The party\u0027s old campaign literature and documents still link out to the old name, instructing people to head to that Twitter account for further information about the party.Anyone visiting that account will see a torrent of pro-Brexit propaganda.

Here\u0027s exactly what has changed, what stayed the same, what the specs are – and how much it will actually cost.The new phones\u0027 key selling point – and the main thing that sets it apart from the Pixel 3\u0026nbsp– is the price.\u0026nbspThe 3a starts at £399 and the 3a XL starts at £469. That\u0027s nearly half the price of their bigger siblings: the 3 starts at £739 and the 3 XL costs at least £869.Those same price differences will be reflected across different markets and on pay monthly plans, too.The phone is available to buy immediately, and is being sold in the UK by Google itself as well as other retailers including EE and Argos.The first thing to mention is that there\u0027s nothing new in the Pixel 3a that wasn\u0027t there in the Pixel 3. The only extra thing it has is the return of the headphone jack, which disappeared on the Pixel 3.So the only real advantage the new phone has over the old one is the price – though that of course is fairly significant.There are some features slashed from the Pixel 3 to get to that cheaper price, and some specs have been downgraded.\u0026nbspIn full, they are: a slightly slower processor, the removal of the selfie cam that allows you to zoom out extra wide and get everyone into a picture, the lack of wireless charging, slightly less high-powered speakers, and no water resistance.The screen sizes are also slightly different. The display on the 3a XL is smaller than its more premium counterpart at 6-inches\u0026nbsp– and is a slightly\u0026nbsplower definition –\u0026nbspand the display on the standard 3a is a little bigger than the Pixel 3 at 5.6-inches.You also miss out on the option to upgrade your storage. The Pixel 3 range allows people to buy up to 128GB of space – but the 3a is stuck at 64GB.Everything else – from the display to the memory – is unchanged.Even the external design is so similar that you can only spot it from the minor tweaks on the outside, like the added headphone jack and the lack of lens for the selfie camera.For your (reduced) money, you get a whole host of decent if downgraded specs. The screens are both FHD+ OLED\u0026nbspdisplays, the phones have Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processors, they have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. On the back is a\u0026nbsp12 megapixel dual-pixel camera, just like on the Pixel 3.As well as all of the specs, Google has promised that the 3a and 3a XL will receive three years of security and operating system upgrades. That\u0027s intended as a way of stressing that this phone won\u0027t be left out in the cold despite its cheaper price and the fact that its processors could become too slow for new updates more quickly.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will learn from these errors and will not make them again.”Purplebricks bemoaned “increasingly challenging” conditions in Australia and confessed to “execution errors”, adding that returns from the nation are “not sufficient to justify continued investment”.It will now commence an “orderly run down” with immediate effect, pending closure.In the US, Purplebricks has put its operations under review.Brexit a major drag on UK housing market as demand slumpsAsking prices slashed by £26,000 as UK housing market slows downThe firm said: “Whilst good progress has been made in launching our brand across the US, the board has materially cut investment in marketing and other overheads to reduce expenditure to sustainable levels and begun a strategic review.”In February, Purplebricks warned over headwinds in the Australian housing market when it admitted that it does not expect to meet revenue forecasts for the year.In the US, the company cautioned that there has been a “slower-than-expected response” to its marketing initiative and it also does not expect US revenue to meet expectations.To compound matters, last month analysts downgraded the online estate agent and said it would have to raise fresh cash.Berenberg warned in a research note that the group should either give up on its international expansion plans or raise more funding as it slashed its rating from buy to sell.It cited a slowdown in Purplebricks’ core UK market, as well as tough conditions in Australia and the US.Purplebricks confirmed that it expects revenue to be within the £130m to £140m range it guided for in February and cash balances will be no lower than £62m.Shares in Purplebricks shed over 5 per cent\u0026nbspin morning trade to 127p.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets, said: “The UK housing market has softened, prices are falling in Australia and cracking the US is proving very difficult.“It’s tried to expand a little bit too quickly, but clearly the market conditions in the UK and Australia have been less than favourable.“In fact, it’s got so bad in Australia that the company is pulling out. In the US it looks like it will materially scale back the business. Canada is better, but small. The focus will now be on Canada, where growth is good, and shoring up the core domestic market in the UK.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Should Iran cease meeting its nuclear commitments, there would of course be consequences.But for so long as Iran keeps to its commitments, then so too will the UK. It is critical that we maintain an open dialogue with Iran.NEW: Theresa May will defy growing pressure from Conservative MPs to speed up her resignation, vowing to stay until Brexit is completed – however long that takes.Backbench Tories will meet later today, having given the prime minister an ultimatum to make clear she will quit No 10 by the summer\u0026nbspin all circumstances.But her spokesman insisted she would defy her own MPs, saying: “That is the timetable she is working towards – she wants to get Brexit done.”Story here:Scottish Tory Colin Clark says he enjoyed welcoming the PM to Scotland and claims it is time for Ruth Davidson to take over leadership.\u0026nbspHe doesn\u0027t seem to acknowledge that Nicola Sturgeon is in charge because the SNP have more MSPs...\u0026nbspMay says the SNP\u0027s record is poor in Scotland.Julian Lewis, a Tory former defence committee chairman, says allowing Huawei to play a role in the UK\u0027s 5G network would be a disaster and praises ministers, present and former - eg Gavin Williamson - for standing up against it.\u0026nbspMay says she takes security very seriously and her record speaks for itself.Labour\u0027s Mary Creagh tries to do another Liverpool question, as Jurgen Klopp has backed a People\u0027s Vote. Why won\u0027t May back it and what is her plan?\u0026nbspMay says the Commons has never supported a second referendum.Tory MP Richard Drax\u0026nbspcongratulates Penny Mordaunt for her appointment as defence secretary.

She says Mordaunt is a former naval reservist and defence minister so she is in a good position. She also has plenty of work to do on equalities within the armed forces.Leadership klaxon - Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns says May has tried her best but she has failed.

MPs murmur at this.\u0026nbspMay says she is sorry for the loss of candidates and she understands what it feels like as she was a councillor herself. But she says it is not about her - if it was, the UK would already have left the EU.Labour MP Gill Furniss\u0026nbspasks May if\u0026nbsppolice cuts and rising knife crime are linked.May says she accepts that knife crime is an issue but rejects the link, saying there are erse causes.Tory MP Rehman Chishti\u0026nbspasks why Asia Bibi has not been offered sanctuary in the UK after being persecuted for her Christian beliefs in Pakistan. She has been offered refuge in Canada.May says the UK has always prioritised her safety - and it supported Canada in its offer. She says the UK has a good record on helping those who are persecuted for their faith.Tory MP Rebecca Pow asks if the government will legislate for net zero emissions by 2050.\u0026nbspMay says the government is looking at the recommendations from the climate change committee and will respond in due course.Tory Sir Edward Leigh\u0026nbspsays the refurbishment of Westminster is very important but must be done in a cost effective way.\u0026nbspHe also raises concern about the planned move to Richmond House for MPs.\u0026nbspMay says its important to keep the bill as low as possible.Change UK MP Joan Ryan gets a question.

To avoid further costs, the withdrawal agreement bill will need to be put before MPs within a week or so – but that will not happen without a Labour agreement not to vote it down.At the weekend, the acrimony was laid bare when John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and other Labour figures accused Ms May of refusing to budge on the party’s central demand for a permanent customs union.How the MPs’ expenses scandal paved the way for BrexitJuncker says mistake for EU to stay silent during Brexit referendumMay faces renewed Tory pressure to quit over Brexit handlingHow to register to vote for the European electionsCorbyn should back a second referendum – but with a crucial conditionHeading into the talks, Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: “The time has now come to a crunch time, where the government has to decide whether it’s serious about significant changes capable of actually carrying a majority in the House of Commons.”He pointed significantly to the clamour over a further referendum, adding: “A confirmatory vote will also be on the agenda, and we’re going to discuss that this afternoon.”No 10 has refused to provide “a checklist” of her continued red lines in the talks, but her own MPs made clear the referendum issue could no longer be dodged.“If there can be no compromise between the parties, I can actually see then the logic, and other people will be demanding another referendum,” Mr Kawczynski added.Mr Vaizey, a former minister, said: “I\u0027ve always been against a second referendum. But I think what is changing my mind is this talk about any agreement reached by parliament being seen as illegitimate.”Any cross-party deal would pass only narrowly, which means MPs would “spend their whole time telling the public that this isn\u0027t Brexit, it’s not the Brexit they voted for – it\u0027s illegitimate”.\u0026nbspEarlier, the prime minister met Graham Brady, the head of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, who was expected to again urge her to set a rapid timetable for her departure.If she refuses, the 1922 will consider rewriting the rules to allow a fresh vote of no confidence this summer – but Sir Graham made no immediate comment on Ms May’s response.\u0026nbspAsked about the EU elections, the prime minister’s spokesman said she “deeply regrets” the fact the UK would be taking part, admitting: “Many members of the public will feel great frustration at this.”The spokesman declined to say whether Ms May thought people should vote in the elections – or whether she would take part in any election campaign launch by the Conservatives.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They want a clean break.Ignoring them will be politically fatal.A FOREIGN holiday is a well-deserved break for many hard-working families.So it beggars belief that Labour is considering slapping a new tax on Brits who diligently save up their cash so they can fly abroad more than once a year.Under a frequent flyer levy, anyone will be penalised when they land back in Britain for the second time. The amount would rise for subsequent journeys.Labour eco-zealots said the plans were aimed at the rich.But millions of ordinary families will find the cost of their holidays rising yet again.Jeremy Corbyn and his Marxist rabble plan to use every aspect of our lives to fleece us.THE police have announced that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson didn’t commit a crime by allegedly leaking information about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.In fact, they said, he didn’t break Britain’s Official Secrets Act, didn’t commit an act of misconduct in public office and it wasn’t a police matter at all.Anyone might think he was fired on Wednesday to ert attention from Mrs May’s Brexit deal with Labour on the eve of the local elections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s their antics that have cost us tonight.”He was just one of several leading Labour councillors who spoke in similarly scathing terms about the damage done by their party’s Brexit shenanigans.And it affects the Conservative Party just as much — , lost council seats can be seen no other way.Anybody who has knocked on a door in the last few weeks knows this is how the country feels and realises the danger our democratic system facesthis lack of trust is not addressed.The public holds both major parties responsible.Unfortunately, it has reached the stage now where one fears the worst and wonders what next pitfall awaits.There are at least two imminent bear traps.The first is a pact with the devil, whereby the Prime Minister does a deal with Jeremy Corbyn simply to wish the problem of Brexit away.Of course, it won’t work. If the UK remains in the Customs Union, it will be a betrayal of Brexit.It will lead to a path that leads to remaining in the single market and subjection to EU law, and it will stop the UK making trade deals with the rest of the world.What a pathetic state of affairs. Essentially agreeing anything, just anything, so long as we no longer have to talk about Brexit. Of course, this would be disastrous. Corbyn is a neo-Marxist.The public do not trust him. This is another clear message from these local elections. Why do deals with somebody so discredited  The very idea filled Conservative councillors, and not a few Tory voters, with fury during this campaign.The second trap would be carrying on regardless.Stick with the Prime Minister’s thrice-rejected deal and claim “there is no alternative”.This seems to be the default position on this Government since last summer.This path will lead to more disagreement, more misery and a hammering in the European Elections the like of which no governing party has ever seen.The Government’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement is deeply flawed.How many times have they been told this  It subjects the UK to EU law-making and hands over £billion for very little in .It was only able to be made tolerablethe Northern Ireland backstop was scrapped or time limited. This is why the House of Commons passed the Brady Amendment.Notably it was literally the only thing the House could agree on.The message was clear — scrap the backstop. Replace with common sense proposals. Anything less is unacceptable.So, what should the Government do now Obviously, it should honour the pledges of all major parties and carry out Brexit speedily and cleanly, preferably with a deal, but failing that, without a deal.That is what the public was promised and that is what the public expects.I have lost count of the number of members of the public who have come up to me, astonished bythe “naivety of a House of Commons who threw away our strongest negotiating card, the threat of No Deal”.It might be politically dficult. It might need courage. But nothing  will suffice.Ignoring the millions of protest votes and spoilt ballot papers will lead to nothing but further misery.The public will respect an admission that mistakes have been made.It will respect an attempt to reconnect the Conservative Party with its voters, activists and members.To ignore one of the angriest responses we have ever witnessed at election time would be suicidal. Surely nobody wants that  Face up, be realistic and put right the mistakes.Go back to the EU and give it one last chance. Renegotiate an acceptable agreement, or we will leave calmly and speedily without a deal.Scrap the European Elections and set the date for leaving as June . It is the only way forward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit. They want it sorted. More than half the adult population want Out.This is natural Tory territory. All it needs is a decent leader.Right now, voters think ex-Tory Nigel Farage is the best on offer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can’t simply take something off somebody and refuse to pay them the proper price.Nobody will shed a tear for the handsomely paid CEOs in Corbyn’s line of fire. But the damage will be felt by all of us. It is a matter of urgency that the Tory party wakes up to the threat.We are perilously close to finding out what socialism looks like in the st century — not in Venezuela but here at home.OUR military is renowned the world over as an elite fighting and humanitarian force.Such professionalism is only possible because of a structure of hard work and discipline in training and beyond.So the plan to encourage lags behind bars into the Army is a welcome one indeed.The values that run through our services are exactly the sort of thing that many a tearaway needs.We hope that the Army gives them a chance,they put in the hard yards, to turn their le around.And go from harming Britain to helping it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college. Gill ­Biggeloe’s “been given a new identity”and flawed hero Ted Hastings is back in charge at AC- where he’s free to complete his Edge Park Hotel TripAdvisor review.“Faulty toilet, no guests, great wi-fi connection.”MY COLUMN s in a fortnight. In the meantime, can I recommend you watch the actor-to-stuntman handover, about four minutes into tonight’s EastEnders, as a topless Keanu escapes down Louise Mitchell’s drainpipe ’Costhat segment doesn’t win the Best Comedy Weight Loss category, something’s gone terribly wrong at next month’s Soap Awards.Piers Morgan: “My collar size used to be  and a half, it got to  and I didn’t like it.”And who would, on their first day at school But let’s talk about the here and now, Chunk.A MAJOR shock during the final episode of Channel ’s absorbing Sunday night series Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.Rugby player Ben Foden voluntarily withdrew, during the interrogation phase, having been subjected to several hours of “disturbing and repetitive noises”.The one thing you’d think he was prepared for, after marrying one of The Saturdays.Whatever demons those ungodly howls awoke in Ben, they didn’t seem to bother Frankie Bridge’s husband Wayne, who’s been the obvious and deserving winner of the series since episode one.The final was still well worth an hour of your time, though, just to see the interrogation of Made In Cha’s Sam Thompson, whose endless backchat, sulking and general toddler antics went down every bit as well as you’d expect with the show’s battle-hardened Special Forces veterans.“Are you pulling a fookin’ face ” “No, Sir.” “Then stop being a fookin’ c*** then.”When verbal threats failed to register, the staff tried guilt-tripping him by menacing Victoria Pendleton with two alsatians.A tactic that probably went down badly with all those people who think the real SAS operates like a community outreach theatre group, pacying hostile forces through the medium of dance and mime.Personally, I thought the whole series was so brilliantly executed it should become an annual fixture, with celebrities forced to do it at gunpointnecessary.And,anyone disagrees, just try telling me you wouldn’t like to see Gemma Collins shoved out of a helicopter backwards.THIS Morning, April , “The woman who can predict the future by throwing asparagus”, Jemima Packington: “Meghan’s going to have the baby by the end of April. Twins, one boy, one girl. By the end of April.”And I’m sure the other one will be out any moment, Jemima.Glenn Hoddle: “The defender’s lying down completely flat with his legs in the air.”APOLOGIES for the recent lack of EastEnders updates.Five months seemed a safe enough gap to leave, and I’m pleased to report the coupling’s been forgotten by everyone – including Louise Mitchell, who was blackmailing Sharon over the affair.There now also seem to be more people living at the Slaters’ house than in Basingstoke – and Robert Kazinsky has even ed from Hollywood to reprise his role as Jean’s prodigal son Sean, having clearly benefited from the experience of landing such stellar parts as Randy in Hot Pursuit and George Jetson in Robot Chicken.The bad news, though, is that EastEnders is on to its sixth version of the endlessly useless Ben Mitchell and, having gone through his gay, incontinent ballet dancer phase, this one clearly thinks he’s Michael Caine, trying to put the heat on Lola’s Geordie boyfriend with this less-than-menacing line: “I’m gonna come up to Noocastle, to that grotty little flat, above that grotty little shop, in Westgate, and I’m gonna kill ya. Any questions ”Just one.How come you’re not deaf any more No. But it is a really terrible f***ing idea. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Theres no getting away from the fact we could have left by now.People will be furious being asked to vote in elections they never wanted and which shouldnt be on.Tories have already blasted the elections as a total waste of money that could be far better spent as we leave the EU.And now its emerged that the cost is set to rocket from around £million to £million since the elections were last held.The extra cash includes £.million of money to be set aside for parties which could have to be reimbursedthe representatives never take up their seats.Deposits for those who say they will stand will have to be repaidthe election is scrapped, the Dailyreported.Staffing and officers will come to around £million and another £million is earmarked for posting out polling cards and information.Brexiteer MP Peter Bone told the paper: It’s a complete waste of public money because there is absolutely no need for these elections, and it should be spent on things people care about, whether that’s operations in hospitals or more police on the streets.Government sources insisted the money was going up because there were no other elections happening on that day, unlike in .The Tories are set for a drubbing in the upcoming poll, as voters punish them for failing to deliver Brexit.Meanwhile, Nigel Farages Brexit party are set to dominate, and are on track to WIN the election, one bombshell poll revealed.The PM is still in talks with Labour over a possible deal in the hope they can avoid taking part in the polls, or take part in them but the candidates never take their seats up.Discussions between the Government and the Opposition were set to take place this afternoon, and Mrs May was rumoured to offer them a customs union deal soft Brexit.However, MPs from both sides are fuming with their leaders.Tories hate the idea of a customs union which would deliver us a soft Brexit without the ability to get trade deals done with countries around the world.And Labour MPs are demanding a second referendum on leaving the EU as the price of their support - something neither Mr Corbyn nor Mrs May want to promise."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000470565031.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pro remain change uk have twitter handle hijacked by hard brexit pranksters in latest blunder from new party","story":"The anti-Brexit party was humiliated yet again after they changed their Twitter address from @TheIndGroup to @ForChange_Now.All their tweets and followers have been moved over to the new address.But the old one was immediately seized by jokers, who started using it to tweet out pro-Brexit messages.The account tweeted copies of the Conservative manesto, which promised to leave the EU.It also put out a picture of one of the groups MPs, Anna Soubry, with the fake quote: Id like to apologise to the British people for the absolute f**king state of me and my views.And they added: Remember, the people that cannot operate a twitter account want you to give them a shot at running the country. I can see why they want the EU to do it for them.The party sent out a message from their new account saying their website and Twitter address had changed.But their website and emails were still redirecting to the old social media address this afternoon.Interim leader Heidi Allens account was still pointing people to the joke handle too.The gaffe is just the latest in a string of humiliations for the new party, which launched earlier this year.One of its candidates was forced to stand down within hours of being revealed - over offensive online comments.Ali Sadjady wrote on Twitter: “When I hear that  per cent of pick pockets caught on the London Underground are Romanian it kind of makes me want Brexit.”And despite pledging to support another referendum, he also wrote back in  that it would be a slap in the face of democracy.A blank space will also appear on the ballot papers later this month for the party - after their logo was rejected by the elections watchdog for having a hashtag in it.All other parties will have a logo there instead.On the partys launch today in February, Labour defector Angela Smith had to apologise for appearing to use the phrase “funny tinge” to describe ethnic minority people.Then when the rebel MPs – eight from Labour and three from the Tories – said they wanted to be known as Change UK they were hit with an angry response from petition website Change.org.Brits are also confused about what the official name for the party is.Theyve known to go by Change UK, The Independent Group, TIG, The Tiggers and other names.The For Change Now handle is likely to confuse their brand even more.The party wants a peoples vote on Brexit to try and overturn the result of the referendum and stay in the EU.The party have been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000477133484.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry birth misled","story":"A couple of weeks ago, that most “woke” of royal couples, Meghan and Harry, made a self-important statement to say there would be no statement about the forthcoming birth of the  squillionth in line to the throne.The nation stopped what they were doing for a moment, muttered “Yer what ” then gave a collective shrug and carried on trying to pay the bills.Then came yesterday’s weird stage management of what could have been a simple “They’ve had a healthy baby boy” statement made at a time that suited them.Instead, at pm, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duchess of Sussex was “in labour” then,  minutes later, followed it up with the news that it was a lb oz boy who, it later transpired, had arrived in the world in the early hours of that morning.So why the smoke and mirrors nonsense  It begs the question: If they put out misinformation about something so innocent, why should we believe what they say in any future statements As the old saying goes, “Don’t start drama and then say you hate drama”.Prince Harry has a special place in our hearts for many reasons, but particularly because he lost his mother at such a young age and was forced by royal duty to walk behind her coffin in full view of the world — a move that, today, seems even more unthinkable than it did then.So it’s understandable that he wanted to keep that most private of moments — the birth of his first child — out of the public gaze for a few precious hours. Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight.

We need to promote activities, services, experiences which connect people and which you just can’t do sitting at home.’But Mr Brokenshire’s comments threatened to spark ridicule from store giants furious at Government apathy over the , high street jobs that have been lost in the last year alone.Mr Brokenshire also criticised town halls for hitting motorists with sky-high parking fees - and suggested that had also had an impact on falling footfall.And he made an appeal to Brits to do their own bit to save high streets with a new ‘think before you click’ attitude.He said: “Next time you flip open the laptop or browse on your mobile for that new outfit for yourself or toys for the children or a special gt for a friend, think about taking a trip out to bag that bargain. It’s often onlyyou touch it, see it and try it that you’ll know it’s right for you.“That’s what will continue to make our high streets special in providing experiences which shopping from the sofa can simply never do.”The Government has spent £ billion in business rate support to help high street stores and has overhauled planning rules to make it easier to build new homes above shops and at the centre of towns and cities.Last year Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged £ million to the Future High Streets Fund to reinvigorate high streets.And Mr Brokenshire also pointed to the Government’s Open Doors’ project that will allow empty high street outlets to be taken over by community groups.“Councils have an important role to play in designing and supporting the vibrant town centres of our future.“It is, of course, up to local authorities to set parking charges but I would urge all councils to think carefully before introducing sharp increases that could turn more people into stay at home shoppers.“Councillors in Ashford saw a surge in shoppers in their town centre after they cut parking fees and put on popular public events to encourage people back to the high street.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her ’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic.”Watching Mrs May give her Tory party conference leader’s speech, in which she says she wants a deal, McLaughlin shouts at the screen: “Oh, f*** off.”He is backed up by Edel Rettman Crosse, Verhofstadt’s top aide.After a row over the Irish border question with Leave-supporting MP Andrew Rosindell, she tells Verhofstadt: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”She adds: “I was delighted. You should shoe the f***er out.

This rule prevents any binding no confidence vote in Mrs May as leader, until December - one year after she survived the last effort by  to . A previous bid to scrap the apos-monthapos rule was blocked by the Committeeaposs executive last month.  But that vote was narrow, and some Tory members now say they could change their minds and back a rule change. Mrs May has said she will quit - but only once her Brexit deal is agreed. And yesterday Downing Street responded to pressure by putting the date for a Brexit deal back even further.Mrs Mayaposs loyal deputy David Lidington confirmed the UK will enter EU elections on May  - costing £million.And the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We would look to complete this ideally by June , butnot then, by summer recess. The summer recess begins near the end of July and lasts well over a month - about the same as school holidays. This could delay her departure to September by holding up a Tory leadership contest.

The Brexit referendum in  cost £.m. According to the Electoral Commission, three-quarters of the cost was for running polling stations - hiring halls, paying people to count, sending out postal ballots.So this new vote will cost £.m to elect each of the UKaposs  MEPs, who stand in  dferent regions. If everyone who was registered to vote in the last general election took part, that would be a cost of £. per vote.Not quite so eye-watering a cost, when you look at it like that.Thereaposs also around m EU citizens resident in the UK, a good chunk of whom will be eligible to vote. Suddenly, the Brexit Partyaposs amazing popularity takes a slight dip, and the cost per vote comes down to around £.. Look at that, European migrants making things cheaper. Itaposs still a lot of money though, right  The traditional nurse-cost ratio performed at such times indicates the price of the EU elections could otherwise buy the services of , nurses. But rarely mentioned in the nurse sums is the fact youaposd get said medic for only a year, andyou evened it out over a -year career youaposre looking at a more modest  nurses. In much the same way, those complaining about the cost of the EU elections are not showing you how they arrived at their outrage. Because the cost of Brexit is bigger. Much, much bigger.Let us start with the £.m in statutory grants given to the two main referendum campaigns, the £.m spent on mailouts by each side, and £m expended by the Electoral Commission to explain things. Added to the polling stations and postal votes, it added up to £.m - slightly less than a general election. Then, of course, we held a general election we didnapost need. It cost £m and ed a hung Parliament, which meant the Prime Minister gave the DUP a £billion bung to support her government.The DUP has since repeatedly abstained or voted against the PMaposs Brexit plans, while spending a little under half the money in its last budget, and watching the New IRA use Brexit as a recruiting tool. That groupaposs murder last month of journalist Lyra McKee, according to a report last year by the Home Office, would cost an average of £.m in criminal, social and health costs. The police work done to uncover old arms caches, investigate car bombs and track down suspect parcels in recent months will add to that figure.And since the referendum, Brexit has cost billions more.  Two new government departments were set up. Thousands of civil servants were recruited or transferred, with their previous posts backfilled. Around , EU regulations were adopted into UK law, which takes time and paperwork, and a further  statutory instruments were processed to amend some regulations before adoption. Each SI was about  pages long, and was scrutinised by Parliament.Both the Commons and Lords have spent three years arguing about Brexit. Select committees have scrutinised it, legislation has been passed, rejected and amended, and almost all other work has ceased while a gridlocked government tries to do things it canapost.The annual cost of Parliament is £m. Even taking into account time spent on other things, Parliament and the government have have probably burned £bn arguing with each other.A further £.bn went on a bung to left-behind towns in Labour heartlands ahead of crucial Brexit votes. That didnapost work, either. In  the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced £m for Brexit planning, and earmarked a further £bn. Defra had a spending increase of £m, and having lost a third of its staff in the cutbacks that began in  now has % more than it started with.HMRC needed £m, and , personnel, for border preparations. The Department for Exiting the EU now has  staff, all with pensions, while the Department for Not Negotiating Much In The Way Of Trade Deals has . The Home Office recruited , people. The Department for Transport signed £m-worth of ferry contracts.Last month, it was revealed the government had stood down , civil servants at a total cost of £.bn and the ferry contracts we didnapost need were paid in full. These hastily-grabbed figures, which are a far from comprehensive list of the costs that can be attributed to Brexit - you could add the price of David Cameronaposs security when he goes to the beach, for example - add up to £,,,. Or, in language weaposre more used to, that would pay for , nurses for a year, and , nurses for  years. And in simpler terms still, £.bn would pay the NHSapos budget deficit FIVE TIMES OVER. If we had spent that money on the NHS instead, thereaposd be no more winter crisis. No more waits that are so long theyaposre being scrapped as an embarassment. No more problems retaining doctors and nurses, no more waving goodbye to EU staff. Itaposs a  equivalence, of course, because had the referendum not been held or gone the other way that money would not have been spent on the NHS.We would just have been told there was no magic money tree. Which, it seems, blooms only in the event of a narrow, non-legally binding, criminally-corrupt and impossible-to-deliver referendum. When they tell you the cost of the EU elections is too high, remember it is not a price charged by the EU. It is a result of  promises, lying buses, leadership coups, bad maths and emotional demands made by racist blow-hards who only ever wanted headlines, TV cameras and a grab at power. They never had a plan, and they still donapost. Thataposs why Brexit has cost you £.bn without even happening.Thataposs THIRTY FOUR times the cost of the EU elections, andNigel Farage wishes to continue taking credit for winning the Brexit vote single-handed it will take him , years of his MEP salary to repay the debt he owes.When you vote, do the maths first.

The new record - the first coal-free week since use of the fossil fuel for electricity began in the th century - was set at .pm on Wednesday, a week after the last generator came off the system. It comes just two years after Britain marked its first full day without coal, but National Grid Electricity System Operatordirector Fintan Slye predicted coal-free generation will become the new normal. He said: As more and more renewables come on to our energy system, coal-free runs like this are going to be a regular occurrence. We believe that by  we will be able to fully operate Great Britainaposs electricity system with zero carbon. Zero-carbon operation of the electricity system by  means a fundamental change to how our system was designed to operate - integrating newer technologies right across the system - from large-scale offshore wind to domestic-scale solar  to increased demand-side participation, using new smart digital systems to manage and control the system in real time.    And he said: Operating a zero-carbon electricity system in , whenever there is sufficient renewable generation, is a major stepping stone to full decarbonisation of the entire electricity system. This will enable new technologies and removes barriers to ever increasing levels of renewables.  Government figures show that renewables - wind, solar, bioenergy and hydropower - accounted for a record .% of electricity supplies in . Low-carbon generation, which also includes nuclear power, accounted for half of supplies , a new record high for clean electricity. Coal, which the Government has pledged to bring off the system by , fell to new lows in , accounting for just % of UK power supplies, while gas made up .% of the supply mix, down from .% in . Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said: Going a week without coal for the first time since the Industrial Revolution is a huge leap forward in our world-leading efforts to reduce emissions, but weaposre not stopping there. To combat climate change and seize on the opportunities of clean growth, weaposre phasing out coal entirely by  and building a cleaner, greener energy system. Government advisers the Committee on Climate Change have outlined how the UK could and should reach net zero emissions by .    Mr Clark said the UK was now on a path to become the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions. Industry body RenewableUKaposs deputy chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, said: Wind has become a mainstream power source for the UK, providing up to % of our electricity over the weekend. Renewables overall are playing a leading role in our energy mix - and have been crucial to phasing out dirty coal. Greenpeace UK chief scientist Dr Doug Parr said: Just a few years ago we were told Britain couldnapost possibly keep the lights on without burning coal. Now coal is quickly becoming an irrelevance, much to the benefit of our climate and air quality, and we barely notice it. But he said quitting coal was the low hanging fruit and action was now needed on phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles, improving home energy efficiency, cutting meat consumption, and planting millions of trees to tackle the climate emergency.

Ofsted inspector Anne Clft said staff were aposnot considering the potential risksapos in a scathing report. The nursery has closed down after the inspection said the safety of young children was apossignicantly compromisedapos. Inspectors, who have just published their report after a visit last month, labelled the nursery inadequate in all areas - the worst rating. Ms Clft said Childrenaposs safety is signicantly compromised. Staff do not risk assess childrenaposs activities. They do not consider the potential risks as children play with large hammers and metal tape measures. Children are not safe when they play with this equipment because staff fail to supervise them adequately. She said staff failed to lock doors which lead out on to roads, meaning children can aposeasily leave the premises without staff noticingapos.    At the time of the inspection  children aged from newborn to four were on the roll. Ms Clft said staff followed strict routines that did not meet the needs of inidual children. For example, staff do not notice when children need to have their nappies changed and only take them to be changed when this is pointed out to them. They delay the opportunity for younger children to sleep because it is not sleep time. This means children are upset and frustrated because they are clearly tired. She described the nursery as aposchaoticapos and said children were given blankets at nap time that were not washed for up to two weeks.  Staff do not motivate children to play, explore and to make new discoveries. Children wander around aimlessly. They are bored, restless and not engaged in purposeful play or learning. This leads to a chaotic and disorderly environment. Their learning and development was poor, as they failed to aposthriveapos and were not well prepared for the next steps in their learning and starting school. She said leaders did not noty Ofsted of apossignicant eventsapos within the required timescale. But staff did check visitorsapos identication and request that they sign the visitorsapos book. The one key strength mentioned in the report was that staff provided the children with healthy snacks and drinks.

The substantial detached house with a garden on a street overlooking Roath Parkaposs Victorian lake in Cardf is on sale for a mere £,. Asfrozen in time it incredibly has the original kitchen and family bathroom from the inter-war period still virtually intact.No integrated appliances or rainforest shower heads are to be found here, instead its kitchen and bathroom decor are straight from the past, Wales Online reports.Itaposs no surprise then to learn that the estate agent selling this four-bedroom period property says they have been showing house every day to potential buyers since it went on the market.  Many of the houses of similar size to this home on this street are valued at way over £, with some easily breaking the £m barrier, should they be put on the market at this time. According to property portal Zoopla, the most expensive sale of a detached house on this road so far was £, in . The three reception rooms have original fireplaces and doors but, while in need of some updating, donapost look too dferent from what youaposd find in many Cardf homes of this kind. But itaposs rare to find a house in this area that comes with its original kitchen and bathroom untouched. Thought to have been built between the two World Wars,  and , visiting this house is like stepping back in a time when electric televisions were a new invention and cars were anything but luxurious.    Set back from the road and overlooking nearby botanic gardens, the double fronted period property has a bonus first floor balcony to enjoy the view outside but the view inside is just as incredible. In particular, the kitchen is the showpiece space thataposs stuck in the past. In here thereaposs no integrated appliances or American-style monster fridge. There is a delightful ceiling drying rack though, so a tumble dryer is not an essential addition. The cupboards look like they were installed at the time this house was born, although there is no sign of a hoosier cabinet, a free-standing kitchen aposworkstationapos cupboard that was the height of fashion in a s kitchen. Thereaposs little doubt that the tiled terrazzo floor and metro wall tiles are original to the  and s and have seen thousands of dinners made up.  Hopefully the metro tiles will escape an interiors cull so many people are now buying modern metro tiles to create character in their homes, when this house comes with the genuine article already in place. Most interiors magazines are currently celebrating thein popularity of the kitchen pantry and the new owner of this house can certainly claim to have the original article to make their friends and neighbours jealous. Another breathtaking space is the bathroom which is very distinctive avocado colour. The toilet is separate to the main bathroom and although some people are not keen on this configuration, it used to be popular as a way of maintaining the privacy of anyone taking a bath not being interrupted by other members of the family desperate to use the other facilities.  And anyone who thinks that heated towel rails are a fairly new home addition should investigate this incredible and substantial original. But the kitchen and bathroom are not the only rooms to boast aposfrozen in timeapos features. The three ground floor reception rooms and hallway still all have their s and s fireplaces plus the beautul parquet wood block floors so popular in the homes built in the inter-war period. And the bathroom isnapost the only facility to sport its first ever suite, it looks likely that the cloakroom sanitary-ware is the original too. In the past the formal dining room was probably the poshest reception room in house, where visitors and guests were fed and entertained and were surely impressed by the wooden wall ling that embraces the whole space. There are numerous original interior doors and built-in cupboards that are sporting their original handles, keys and latches and throughout the home there is an abundance of coving, skirtings and picture rails.

The Duchess of Sussex - who gave birth at dawn on Monday - has kept the unnamed Baby Sussex away from prying eyes so far. But the first photos of the two-day-old baby will be released later today. And Meghan, , requested CBS be involved in the coverage - the broadcaster whose morning show is hosted by friend Gayle King. King, one of the Duchesses best pals, attended Meghanaposs baby shower in New York earlier this year. For all the information and updates on the royal baby click here.    The decision came as a surprise to British television channels including the BBC and ITV – not to mention many at Buckingham Palace. There have been claims the inclusion of CBS was to aposreflect the international interest in the storyapos of Baby Sussex. But the Daily Mail claims that British broadcasters are furious - and that there are concerns the decision will be seen as a aposslap in the faceapos to Commonwealth broadcasters, particularly in countries such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The paper quotes a source who said: It’s a decision that has taken everyone by surprise and has not gone down well in some quarters.    Last month Harry and Meghanaposs office announced they would be keeping details of the birth private. There were no photos of the Duchess of Sussex just hours after the birth, as there was of Kate Middleton with all three of her children. So the first glimpse of the unnamed baby will be had by the world today following a small photocall and chat. The request to include an American broadcaster was allegedly initially refused by the palace because according to tradition only UK broadcasters were invited to aposrepresentapos the UK taxpayer.    Buckingham Palace was not involved in the decision to pick CBS, with sources saying the US network was ‘self-selected’, causing some consternation among other domestic and international outlets. Ideally for Gayle King, who was a guest at Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, it is expected that footage of Baby Sussex will be broadcast in America in time for her popular breakfast show, This Morning.

Wendy Unettaposs teenage son Liam Roche was punched in the temple while protecting a younger friend from “drunk thug” Samuel Kelly outside a McDonaldaposs in Birmingham on January  last year. She sang to Liam, , as she watched him take his last breaths two weeks later when doctors turned off his le support machine. As a kne crime epidemic has continued to sweep through Britain since his death, the -year-old mum-of-three was horried to see people urging others on social media to aposuse fists - not knives.apos Speaking for the first time since her sonaposs death, Wendy said: Thereaposs so much talk about kne crime, which is right, but people forget that punching also kills.    Iaposve seen so many posts on social media where people say aposuse your fist not a kne.apos But fists kill too. People fight all the time and they donapost realise the damage they could be doing. That one punch took Liamaposs le and totally changed all of ours forever. An investigation by Mirror has revealed that dozens of messages are prolerating on social media, urging people to aposuse fists not knives.apos Facebook and Twitter have had a deluge of comments and threads, many written by mums and dads unaware of the dangerous message they are sharing. One dad wrote on Facebook: “Fight with fists, not knives!!!” A woman from London wrote: “What happened to fighting with fists like a proper human being, who gives you any right to decidea human deserves to live or not ”    Another mum-of-two wrote: “Fight with fists, not knives! Cowards!” And a father, commenting on a recent stabbing wrote: “This is why you donapost use knives people, what happened to the old days where you use your fists you get up shake hands and it’s done with a real mans way   Another man wrote: “Heartbreaking! only the weak need to stab somebody, learn to punch you fools.”  But Liamaposs mum Wendy knows just how devastating the consequences of one single punch can be. Recalling the night of the attack Wendy said: When he got home that night at about .am I was sitting up waiting for him downstairs. He said that he was out at McDonaldaposs and aposfully grown bloke, really bigapos who was drunk and being abusive with everyone went to grab his friend, who is .    Liam told the man to leave his friend alone, he was never tolerant of bullying, and then the man just punched him. I told him he had to go to hospital, that he might have a brain injury. But he said he was fine. Then at about am he called me and said he felt sick. I said: Liam, you need to go to hospital.apos But he refused again and said he just wanted to go to bed. I asked himhe wanted me to get into bed with him and lie at the opposite end and he said, aposyeah.apos Almost as soon as I got into the bed he started fitting.  I could feel his leg shaking then his whole body started moving. I shouted for his brother as I called the ambulance.    It was horrible. His brother held him and I rolled him onto his side. There was foam coming from his mouth.” Liam was rushed to Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital where Wendy kept a bedside vigil for the next  days but sadly Liam’s body began shutting down. Doctors said that theyaposd already kept him longer than they should have”, said Wendy. He wasnapost able to retain liquid food, his organs were shutting down, he had pneumonia and he was brain-dead. So on Friday, February , Liamaposs machine was switched off. Before they switched it off, loads of his family and friends came into the cubicle. They played music for him and kissed him. Some of them stayed the night. I lay next to him in his bed that night. A family friend stayed on a campbed in the room. Four of Liamaposs friends stayed by the bed and held Liamaposs hand.    Nurses moved Liam over on the bed so that I could stay with him. I didnapost eat or drink that day. We played the Bette Middler song aposWind Beneath My Wingsapos and as I sang it to him, his breathing started to go and he passed away minutes later. I havenapost listened to that song since.” Heartbroken Wendy still keeps the Tommy Hilfiger pouch Liam wore that night with his money still in it, - a precious reminder preserved forever in a glass cabinet at their home which also holds his ashes and framed photos. And she’s haunted by dreams of her deceased son. I havenapost been able to sleep properly since he died. I wake up through the night thinking about him. Heaposs the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of at night. Sometimes heaposs still alive in my dreams but sometimes heaposs already dead but I canapost find his body.” Liam’s killer Samuel Kelly, , was sentenced to seven years in prison in November after being found guilty of manslaughter. Liam stuck up for his friend and thataposs why he got hit,” said Wendy. I have a lot of emotion because of that. His death says everything about how he was as a person because thataposs how Liam was. He always stuck up for friends, he didnapost agree with bullying. Liam had an eggshell skull. We didnapost know it at the time but his skull was much thinner than average so any form of impact could lead to death. Doctors told us that with a head fracture, there can be a delayed reaction, but as soon as he was punched that night there was very little anyone could do to save him.  “It was already too late. So evenhe went to hospital sooner that night, the outcome would not have been dferent. Where he was punched was the thinnest part of the skull.” Wendy has some comfort in remembering how happy Liam was on the last day of his le. He had received a £ insurance payment that day and had just bought a motorbike and an expensive helmet. Hours before his death, he touched his temple where he would soon receive the fatal blow, and told his mum that the helmet was aposto protect his headapos. Wendy said: Liam had just had a payout that day after he was in a car crash the previous year. He bought a small motorbike and a £ helmet. I asked him why he bought such an expensive helmet and he touched his head, just where he was hit, and said aposI have to protect my head mum.apos He was really happy that day. He was out with friends but he kept coming home to see his new baby brother Hugo who was just two weeks old.  Liamaposs family wanted his funeral to be a celebration of his le so called it aposLiamaposs Le Partyapos. A Harley Davidson pulled his pure white coffin to the church where family and friends sang R-Kellyaposs aposWorldaposs Greatestapos. They then danced and sang in memory of Liam all night long. He had a really lovely send-off. The funeral was rammed, they had to open the doors of the church. Most people wore t-shirts with his face printed on them. We had a humanist give the service rather than a vicar because Liam wasnapost religious and we wanted the funeral to be about Liam.  We sang the R-Kelly song aposWorldaposs Greatestapos and where the lyrics say aposyouaposre that star up in the skyapos we sang, aposLiamaposs that star up in the sky.apos Everyone boomed it out.  We hired a hall and a DJ and his friends danced and sang for him all night long. Liam was cremated with the childrenaposs book aposGuess How Much I Love Youapos with the famous words aposI love you to the moon and backapos which Wendy read to him every day in hospital before his death - and in the funeral home before his final road trip. The family placed a bench with a plaque for Liam on it in their garden in Birmingham where people can remember him.  Wendy said: His friends come and sit there to be with him.

The two-day-old royal baby is being referred to as Baby Sussex until the proud parents let the world in on their secret. But the coupleaposs fans wonapost have to wait long - the newbornaposs name is set to be revealed on Wednesday afternoon after he is introduced to his great-grandmother the Queen. The monarch doesnapost have the final say on the name, but the couple will take her opinion into account, according to experts. After former Suits actress Meghan, , gave birth on Monday morning, the couple took a few days to celebrate in private and adjust to le with their bundle of joy.  Royal watchers were hoping the couple would reveal the babyaposs name as they showed him off for the first time on Wednesday, but that didnapost happen. They are now hoping the announcement will come later on Wednesday after the newborn meets his great-grandmother at Windsor Castle. Baby Sussex was sleeping soundly, wrapped in a white blanket and wearing a delicate white knitted hat as he was shown off. It is expected the couple will follow in the footsteps of other royals and give their baby a traditional name.    There is also speculation over whether the Queen will allow Baby Sussex to become a prince. Bookmaker William Hill said the favourite is Spencer at   - the maiden name of Harryaposs late mother Princess Diana. James and Alexander were both at  . Paddy Power says the favourites are Alexander , Spencer , James , Theodoreand Arthur . It is the Queenaposs decision as to whether the baby receives a royal title.    But the decision over the babyaposs name is more relaxed, and Meghan and grandson Harry, , donapost necessarily need her approval for the babyaposs name. Experts say it is likely the -year-old Queenaposs opinion will be taken into account in an informal conversation. If the Queen says she doesnapost like the name, the couple is likely to take that into account, according to experts.

Amid surroundings steeped in royal history, the latest royal baby made his debut behind closed doors, with a small press pool of only one reporter, one photographer, three cameramen, as well as the coupleaposs own private photographer and a household press officer photographer. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcomed their first child at the exclusive Portland Hospital in London on Bank Holiday Monday. Despite intense interest surrounding Meghanaposs birthing plan, the Duke and Duchess have managed to keep details of Baby Sussexaposs arrival extremely private. On Sunday, the royal couple and Meghanaposs mum Doria Ragland travelled in secret from Windsor to the posh private hospital where the child was delivered.  The trio are said to have travelled in a two-car convoy, with only a handful of people informed, for the -minute journey into the capital. Escorted by Scotland Yard, they were able to slip into the hospital unnoticed and then exit in the same manner, the Daily Mail claims. Baby Sussex was born weighing lbs oz at .am on Monday morning. Harry and Meghan are then claimed to have spent four hours at the hospital with their newborn child, before the prince is believed to have contacted aides to tell them the happy news. The new parents and Doria then travelled back to Frogmore - where Harry is said to have got two hours kip.  Meanwhile, for reasons that are still unclear, Kensington Palace released a statement that Meghan was in labour at .pm - seven hours after the child was born. Then, less than  minutes later, Harry went to the stables at Windsor Castle for a pre-arranged TV interview where he confirmed the birth of his son. In the run up to the birth, it was the consensus that Meghan and Harry had wanted to have a home birth. But with the mum-to-be overdue they are said to have started making other plans. It is claimed the pair started speaking to medical staff at Portland - the site of multiple celebrity and royal births - as well as packing essentials. Then on Sunday evening, they are thought to have been taken into central London - but not under blue flashing lights - for the birth to take place. The couple spoke openly about how excited they were to become parents after announcing their happy news on the eve of their Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in October. The new baby will grow up at Frogmore Cottage , which has just undergone a huge renovation.

Lauren Murray had her first severe headache when she was  - only for it to never go away. She now suffers constant pain every day - with several days a month where the pain is unbearable. Lauren, , manages to go to work but says she missed lots of social occasions growing up and struggled to visit one friend who had a telegraph pole outside her house because it triggered her bad heads.A migraine is the most common and disabling neurological condition in the UK, affecting one in seven Brits, or around nine million people.It is more prevalent than diabetes, epilepsy and asthma combined.    Just % of sufferers endure the chronic form on  or more days a month and even fewer have it permanently. Lauren, of Guildford, Surrey, explained: My mum had always suffered with migraine and before I was born, my dad had one that lasted for six months. I guess Iaposm unlucky in that I clearly have it on both sides of my family. Sometimes I feel sorry for myself and think aposWhy me apos but why does anyone suffer from anything  Itaposs just one of those things. You have to adapt your le. Lauren had to take several weeks off school when her migraine first started. When it failed to go away, her mum took her to the family GP. She saw neurologists and was then given a cat scan, which came back clear. She also had an occipital nerve block - a painful injection into the nerves which supply the scalp - before her GCSEs to help her cope. But as far as tests go, doctors cannot pinpoint anything wrong with her. She simply has a diagnosis of continual chronic migraine.    Medication has also failed to make any dference to her condition, with some common migraine drugs even making her symptoms worse. She now manages to work as a dog groomer and says she copes with her condition by having an understanding employer and a great partner, Hannah Grist, . Other coping strategies include listening to classical music, turning lights off and avoiding harsh lights and strong smells.Her headaches can also be triggered by not drinking enough water and not eating enough.She says GPs should be more alert to her form of the condition. She said: It took four years to diagnose and no-one really knew what it was. It feels just like a normal migraine, but the intensity of the headache changes. My mum was quite good with it when I was younger and really pushed the doctors to figure out what was going on. People ask how I cope but itaposs very much one of those things. You either let it take over your le or you choose to stand above it and keep trying to fight through it.    Lauren says her chronic migraine meant she missed a lot of social occasions growing up and made it hard for her to socialise. She also had to give up swimming and ing professionally. As well as that, Lauren avoids garlic and onions, which almost always ramp up the pain. Alcohol, caffeine and high sugar foods are also no nos. She says one of the things that gets her through the pain is having a career she loves. She has been grooming dogs from the age of  and says her employer is amazing. Her dog Oscar also gives her a reason to get up in the morning.  She went on: Getting up and going to a job I love really helps. I have a dog at home too and he gets me upIaposm having a bad day. Itaposs a lesaver. Iaposm a very determined person. When my migraine first started I took two weeks off school and from then on Iaposve only had one day off. It was very dficult when it first started because a lot of doctors didnapost believe me. Doctors would ask my mumthey thought I was trying to get attention. That was very dficult to deal with. I wonapost let it stop me learning or being the best me, but neither would I wish it on my worst enemy. Una Farrell, of the Migraine Trust, said sufferers should go back to their doctorsthey cannot get any relief. She added: Chronic migraine is a complex neurological condition and it must be having a huge impact on her le. It is very rare, but it can be treated.

Instead of mama or the slightly easier to say dada, Annabelle tapped the Amazon Echo and repeatedly blurted out Alexa. Annabelle had been watching her brother Lucas, three, playing with the voice-activated gadget for months. So when it came to the totaposs milestone moment - which Catherine got husband Liam in to witness too - she knew exactly what to say.    Since uttering her first word on Monday, Liam said Annabelle has repeated it a dozen times - even when she was getting baptised later that day. The police officer said: Weaposve been battling for her to say aposmummyapos or aposdaddyapos but she just went in a completely dferent direction. Sheaposs the definition of a modern-day baby.

Redbubble was selling a £ miniskirt showing a black-and-white image of chimneys at the site where victims - mostly Jews - were starved and gassed en masse, and their bodies burned in crematoria. A photo of railway tracks leading to Auschwitz-Birkenau was printed on a £ throw pillow for a sofa, while a £ tote bag featured a shot of an electric fence that prevented prisoners from escaping. The unacceptable products were pulled from the website after they sparked outrage and complaints from the Auschwitz Memorial, which preserves the site of the Nazi death camp.    It is estimated that at least .million people -  per cent of them Jews - were sent to the concentration and extermination camp in German-occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust. Of those, .million were murdered. After discovering the products on Redbubble, the Auschwitz memorial tweeted: Do you really think that selling such products as pillows, mini skirts or tote bags with the images of Auschwitz - a place of enormous human tragedy where over , million people were murdered - is acceptable   This is rather disturbing and disrespectful. A response on Redbubbleaposs Twitter account read: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The nature of this content is not acceptable and is not in line with our Community Guidelines.

It faced anger on social media as screen grabs of the Auschwitz-themed products went viral. Marina Amaral, the founder of Faces of Auschwitz who restores and colorises black and white photos, wrote on Twitter: Disgusting. Another user wrote: Absolutely disgusting putting these images on things like these. Hopefully no one in their right mind will buy them.

The incident took place in the La Pastora Ecological Park, Nuevo Leon, northern Mexico. Local media reports the woman, who has not been named but is around -years-old, dropped her phone and it fell into the rhino enclosure. She is not believed to have informed any of the zoo workers and ignored signs warning visitors not to enter the enclosures. In footage filmed by an onlooker, the woman can be seen trying to climb the steep walls of the small moat surrounding the enclosure as a huge rhino stands just a few feet away.    The woman managed to escape unharmed but the management of the zoo have condemned her behaviour. They will not file legal proceedings against her but have reportedly banned her from visiting the park in the future. The zoo management said the rhino, which can be seen in the video, has a calm temperament.

Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this. In this time and age it is unreasonable to expect communities to exist without mobile phone coverage.ldquoAny visual impact is completely outweighed by the economic and social benefits of allowing this application to proceed.Councillors voted unanimously to approve the application."},{"url":null,"title":"gala-man-remanded-following-alleged-weekend-disturbance","story":"A GALASHIELS man accused of being involved in a disturbance at the weekend has been remanded in custody until the outcome of his trial.Jordan Cunningham, , of Forest Place, appeared from custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court and denied a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and breaching his bail conditions.A trial date has been set for June  at Selkirk Sherf Court with an intermediate hearing on May ."},{"url":null,"title":"dancing-themselves-dizzy-at-braw-lads-declaration-night","story":"DANCERS from across Galashiels and beyond put their best feet forward on Friday evening at the Braw Lads Gathering Declaration Night.As has become customary, primary seven pupils representing all of the schools in the Galashiels Academy catchment area, celebrated the announcement of the Principals with a dance.And they were joined by this years Braw Lad, Robbie Lowrie, and Braw Lass, Nicola Laing beneath the Burgh Chambers for the Dashing White Sergeant.Taking part this year were:Balmoral Primary School - Charlotte Scott, Sky Hume, Malina Corrin, Maisie Pringle, Alexander Pringle  Jessica Elliott.Burgh Primary School - Lewis Campbell, Hannah Crawford, Rhianna Devlin, Lucy Johnston, Olivia Jones, Kian McGill  Reece Shillinglaw.Clovenfords Primary School - Melanie McGauchrane, Faith Herriot, Codie Stewart, Ethan Deane, Joshua Hewitt  Grace Decoteau.Fountainhall and Heriot primary schools - Sarah Pate  Heather BrinkworthGlendinning Terrace Primary School - Madison Wight, Gemma Duffie, Erin Grey, Orla Johnstone, Isla Train, Chrissie Allison  Kaitlyn Martin.For full coverage of the Braw Lads Gathering Declaration Night turn to pages   .Langlee Primary SchoolOlivia SobeckaPaige CurrieLaughlin SaundersKaycee McArdleMaya QuinnRhianna HughesSt Margarets Primary SchoolAnne MitchellKatie McDougallAine McLeodInes ReidHannah NewallCarly McGregorAnne Mitchell presented the bouquet to the Braw LassSt Peters Primary SchoolEllie CockburnAbigail BurnsGeorgie EverettAmy OwensonKeira SwanStow Primary SchoolSavannah BrownIsla DuncanRebecca LeylandMaggie HodgsonElla SmithLeah RochesterTweedbank Primary SchoolOlivia LugtonKady McGlassonSophie AitkenSophia SuloEllis BrotherstonKyle FitzgeraldHarry Moffat"},{"url":null,"title":"mp-johns-marathon-effort-for-marie-curie","story":"BORDERS MP John Lamont completed the London Marathon at the weekend.And the Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk is also closing in on his fundraising target for Marie Curie Scotland.Mr Lamont was one of the , runners who took to the streets of London on Sunday morning.The -year-old finished the . miles in  hours  minutes and  seconds.John, who was one of  MPs taking part in the race, had set a fundraising target of pound, and he was closing in on the pound, barrier when we went to press.He said: ldquoIrsquom absolutely delighted to have finished the marathon and to have been able to raise some money for a worthwhile cause.ldquoThe crowds lining the streets of the capital were amazing and the atmosphere was electric.\"It really helps you to keep going to have so many people cheering you on.ldquoIrsquove really appreciated all the messages of support and the donations that have come in for Marie Curie.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach. These breakwaters are supposed to prevent that from happening.ldquoIf we can get sand onto the beach, it should stay.The plans, submitted and approved by East Lothian Council, include repairing or replacing an existing groyne on the southern end of the beach that has fallen into disrepair.A rock groyne will be created at the northern end of the beach, opposite the junction with The Vennel, with a concrete groyne towards the south, while a rock breakwater will also be included.The work is split into four sections, with the refurbishment of the existing groyne acting to retain the beach level in the area as it is currently.Secondly, the breakwater, in addition to providing direct protection to a limited section of the defence, will allow an assessment of the capacity for a natural beach to be developed.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Mr Hampshire said time had been taken to find the design most likely to boost the beach.But he added: ldquoThere are no guarantees ndash we are fighting against nature here.Mr Hampshire told community councillors he was hopeful work could start ldquoearly summer.Discussions have been ongoing for more than five years regarding what can be done to try to turn the clock back and see the beach looking as it did in the past.Previous suggestions have included bringing sand across from Crail and St Monans in Fe.Mr Hampshire said that had not been ruled out ndash and every option would be explored ndash but it would prove ldquoreally expensive.Pippa Swan, community council chairwoman, thanked Mr Hampshire for his efforts in bringing the scheme forward.She stressed the importance of the beach and said: ldquoI think East Beach is just part of the place that Dunbar is.ldquoIt has been a holiday destination for a long time and people remember it as a sandy place and a place of leisure.ldquoThis rocky quarry we have now is something that saddens a lot of people.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said they were not yet in a position to reveal the cost of the scheme.She added: ldquoWork identied as helping to tackle erosion concerns on the East Beach will go out to tender with a view to work starting later this year, hopefully before the autumn period."},{"url":null,"title":"knox-academy-pupils-and-staff-team-up-for-edinburgh-marathon","story":"A team of  will represent Knox Academy at the Edinburgh Marathon Festival in the half marathon.Eleven pupils and eight members of staff will all pull on special t-shirts highlighting that they are running for East Lothian Special Needs Playscheme .Alex Redford, a modern studies teacher at the school, said they were looking forward to taking to the start line on May .He said: ldquoS have really tried to embody the school values of Ambition, Respect and Community this year.ldquoThey have worked so very hard on ious fundraisers throughout the year and it has been great to see them really engage with the school values.Pupils Matthew Black, Dylan Brotherston, Isabelle Bowen, Elliot Cochrane, Harry Cunningham, Hana Elder, Adam Fairgrieve, Mateusz Juchniewicz, Max Leveque, Daniel Mackinnon and Lauren Taylor will be joined on the start line by Lana Borwick , Robert Flood , Susanne Fox , Steven Illingworth , Adam Miller , Thomas Salkeld , Suzie Stewartand Mr Redford.Pupil Dylan said: ldquoThere is a little bit of friendly rivalry between the pupils.ldquoObviously, we are all quite competitive with each other and we are quite close friends.

Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough.

Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor   Cybernats    and extremists represent the worst of times","story":"Written in , harking back to Francersquos Reign of Terror, it is also a sobering reminder of what can happen when nuance is removed from public discourse. And unfortunately, dear reader, there is much to worry about these days on that score.Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsNowhere do we see it more than on social media. With this in mind, I applaud unequivocal attempts by prominent SNP figures, as outlined in yesterdayrsquos Herald, to denounce the online abuse spat out by some on their side of the constitutional debate, not just at opponents of independence, but anyone who dares say or tweet something, no matter how innocuous, that doesnrsquot chime entirely with their world view. Describing such keyboard warriors as ldquoweird, ldquocreepy, ldquopoisonous, ldquovicious ldquocowards, former party deputy Angus Robertson, MP Stewart McDonald and MEP Alyn Smith are absolutely right to point out that such trolling, bullying and harassment ndash much of it aimed specically at women ndash is not only out of order, but ultimately damaging to the cause they support.If anyone is in any doubt about the form this sort of intimidation takes, you need only look at last weekrsquos bullying of BBC Scotland journalist Emma Clford Bell. Researching a piece about Dundeersquos reaction to Nicolarsquos Sturgeonrsquos announcement on a possible second independence referendum, she did her job and appealed on social media for a pro-Union voice to appear among a ldquoiety of opinions ndash including pro-independence supporters ndash to be featured in the package. What followed was a pile-on of epic and bizarre proportions, as hundreds jumped on the bandwagon and accused her of bias, told her to ldquof*** off , that she was ldquoscum, a ldquoclown of a lassie and a ldquostupid bint.Primarily, this is a very personal ndash not to mention sexist ndash attack on Ms Clford Bell. But it also represents a worrying and increasingly common assault on the act and process of journalism itself, a wilful misunderstanding of what journalists do, a knowing conflation of news and comment, a perpetuation of the warped idea that ldquogood journalism is what I agree with, and ldquobad journalism is everything .Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsMore than anything, it reflects a worrying lack of critical thinking. Indeed, some of the responses to those who criticised the bad behaviour are as grim as the initial attack blaming the victim, whatabouteryand reeling off old complaints about BBC presenters only makes it worse. Whorsquod want to share a movement, let alone a country ndash independent or not ndash with these people Ms Clford Bellrsquos experience is a depressing sign of the times that reflects a more general willingness to trade critical thinking for the ease of conspiracy theories, righteous anger, having a , and a sense of identity and community, eventhe latter is based on nothing more than the precarious idea of a shared enemy.At the same time, the power and reach of social media also attracts those looking to monetise certain views, not to mention nefarious organisations and even foreign states whose main aim is to stir up trouble. And since the current system encourages anonymity and duplicity, it can be hard to work out who or what is even real.The so-called lsquoCybernatsrsquo exist in a relatively tiny corner of social media, of course, their vitriol matched by those shouting about other extreme world views, most notably ldquoBrit Nats, Hard Brexiteers, Trump supporters and white supremacists.Theyrsquore all equally unsavoury, flourishing by using OTT, hysterical narratives to pinpoint and frame their attacks, often choosing to personally abuse the target in the process humiliate, intimidate and crush.Since they shout so loud, the lsquoCybernatsrsquo often succeed in getting the attention they crave, which in turn exaggerates how representative their views are within the Yes movement, thus turning off more moderate supporters and potential new recruits to the cause.Depressingly, thatrsquos why I think it will be so dficult for Messrs Robertson, McDonald and Smith to change anything. The attack dogs do so knowingly, in order to deliberately provoke attention, or are so far down the unthinking zealot road as to be beyond reach. What both have in common is that the more they insult, the easier it becomes.Such abuse has nothingto do with independence per se, but the damage for the wider Yes movement will be harder to disassociate.The appeal for nuance and persuasion comes at a time when both seem out of fashion, while extreme language pulses and trends through our discourse.Those of us looking for comfort should perhaps turn back to Dickens. At the very least, A Tale of Two Cities reminds us that nothing ndash not even the worst of times - lasts forever."},{"url":null,"title":"blair-scotland-is-right-to-stay-in-eu-but-it-would-be-wrong-to-leave-the-uk","story":"On the inside, the grand-sounding Institute for Global Change has the feel of a five-star Middle Eastern hotel upmarket furniture, modern paintings of what look like Jerusalem, chrome and glass and, of course, photographs, many of the former Prime Minister with the likes of Barack Obama and other world leaders, past and present.The receptionist greets me with a smile and Irsquom ushered up the lt, past a bank of aides tapping earnestly on their keyboards, to a grand reception room with sofas and a desk.Read more: Harsh politicians like Salmond put me off claiming Scots nationality, says Tony BlairMr Blair breezes in, apologises for the delay, saying he has just been on an important international call.The air of calm authority is still there, along with the receding hairline and wrinkles.

One of the things thatrsquos so depressing about the state of British politics at the moment is that people donrsquot see this big picture about the way the world is changing and realise therefore that at every single level your alliances become important.ldquoScotlandrsquos alliance with England is important. Britainrsquos alliance with Europe is important. Europersquos alliance with America is important. Because you are faced for the first time in modern times power is shting east [to] China and India. This is a vast geopolitical change.ldquoWe are more interconnected than ever before and therefore any alliance you have increases your own power.Mr Blair makes very clear he does not believe in allowing the First Minister a second bite at the independence apple.He says: ldquoFirst of all, I donrsquot think we should have one unless there really is a big groundswell of opinion for it and I donrsquot see that.ldquoSecondly, to be brutally frank about it, the last thing we need at this moment is another huge dose of constitutional uncertainty we really would start to damage ourselves fundamentally as a country.But I point out that, in the interconnected world he refers to, surely the Scottish Nationalists have a point thatthe UK leaves the EU, it would make sense for Scotland to leave the UK to rejoin the EU He does not accept the argument.ldquoI would still want Scotland to remain with the UK be in no doubt about that, says Mr Blair.ldquoBut itrsquos a statement of common sense thatScotland is in favour of Britain remaining in Europe and Britain leaves Europe, yoursquove obviously got another argument.ldquoI know when I say this some people in Scotland on my own side say: lsquoOh God, you canrsquot say that,rsquo but itrsquos a statement of the obvious. If yoursquore a Nationalist, it gives you an additional argument which is another very good reason by the way for not doing Brexit.I suggest he is taking a contradictory position by suggesting the last thing Britain needs is another Scottish referendum, but he is in the same breath proposing another one on Brexit.Mr Blair holds up his hands and says: ldquoI wasnrsquot in favour of having the referendum in the first place I wouldnrsquot have had the referendum on Europe.

Labour needs to appear willing to negotiate, but wants the blame to lie firmly with the Prime Minister when talks fail.Coming to an agreement with Mrs May, even a good one, would make Mr Corbyn an accessory to Brexit. And itrsquos not at all clear that the Labour leadership actually wants another referendum. It has anyway been relegated to the status of a backstop against a ldquobad Tory Brexit. Shadow Cabinet figures like Diane Abbott believe a repeat referendum would probably result in another Leave vote. But Mr Corbyn is acutely aware that his legions of youthful fans in Momentum support a Peoplersquos Vote. So he tries to look both ways at once.This may be enough to get Labour through the European elections. Many Conservative constituency associations, and MPs like Boris Johnson, are refusing to campaign for these elections on the grounds that they should never have taken place.

Labour is not going to do particularly well either, but , by pursuing a policy of studied ambiguity, it can hold onto some Leave and some Remain voters, that will do nicely.But it wonrsquot be so nice for the rest of us. Mrs May has to go, even , as happened with Chamberlain, the successor is a isive character like Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson is the party favourite to take over, and while many of us might find that an unattractive option, it would at least force the issue to some kind of resolution.

It can be done ndashyou want to.Regina Erich,Stonehaven.AS the SNP ratchets up the rhetoric for yet another independence referendum it was inevitable that the currency issue would rightly once more become the central part of the debate ndash unless, of course, you simply agree with Nicola Sturgeon that independence can somehow miraculously \"transcend\" the economy. For example, some SNP supporters have argued in these columns that as the Canadian dollar floats freely with the United States\"without any problems\", a Scottish currency should also work. However, what they fail to mention is that the Canadian dollar runs at around a  per cent discount to the US dollar, which would be similar to what we should expect against a pound sterling ndash especially when one factors in transaction costs. The knock-on effect on higher mortgages and borrowing costs would under these circumstances be extremely painful for all concerned.Others have claimed the pound was losing its attractiveness due to the UKs trade deficit in goods of pound billion as a reason for Sterlings decline but conveniently ignore the poundbn surplus on services in . Furthermore the overall deficitis entirely due to the trade with the EUand not with the rest of the world where we are in surplus and conduct most of our business under WTO-based rules.Finally, it seems strange that the SNP, which is now so desperate to be a full member of the EU, is already trying to distance itself from joining the euro at some time in the future when a key piece of the European lawstates that a new joining member would have to adopt the euro or find itself \"not fully compatible\".Small wonder the is are hopelessly split about the future direction of an independent Scottish currency when the wiser headsurge caution and the flag-waving members want to jump over the clf edge regardless of the economic consequences.Ian Lakin,Aberdeen AB.ALAN Stephenattacks your correspondent Kevin Mackennas remarks on Ruth Davidson where he wrote that she was back with the ldquosame stale old anti-independence but does not apply the same treatment to Nicola Sturgeon.Ms Sturgeons pro-independence principles have not changed, unlike Ms Davidson, who said two years ago that there was no reason for Theresa May to block a second independence referendum but now thinks she should.Opinions may change, but principles should not, unless she is a believer in Groucho Marx who stated: \"Themrsquos my principles, andyou donrsquot like them, I have others.Jim Lynch,Edinburgh EH.YOU quote a Conservative MP as saying that his party believes in ldquoOne nation values whereas the SNP does not .

Now, as we look back over  years to the first Scottish Parliamentary election, it is surely unthinkable that we should ever turn the clock back. And in an age when politicians and political institutions are regularly under attack, perhaps one of the most signicant achievements is that our Parliament is so embedded in Scotlandrsquos political landscape.Its achievements go much further than that. One doesnrsquot have to have approved of all the legislation passed since , but the legislative record of the Parliament is impressive compared to what would have been achievedWestminster had continued to find time for only one or two Scottish measures in a year.Within weeks, the new Parliament had passed the Mental Health Act to plug a signicant legal loophole. It undertook long overdue legislation on land reform. It implemented a host of outstanding Scottish Law Commission proposals.We created National Parks. We opened new railway lines. We provided a Freedom of Information regime, more open and robust than applies to UK public bodies.We led the way in the UK in effecting a ban on smoking in public places. Scotland continues to lead the way in promoting a presumption against very short prison sentences.Moreover, the experience of many who seek to lobby or simply have their voices heard, is that government, ministers and officials, are much closer and more accessible.I recall a visit to Barcelona in the early s, when Scotlandrsquos business community was generally still hostile to any kind of devolution. Something may have been gained in the translation, but our Catalan business hosts said that one of their perceived advantages of devolved government was that ldquothe bums were closer to kick. Many Scottish Ministers over the last  years may attest to that.Notwithstanding achievements, from the Parliamentrsquos earliest days, we had to cope with brickbats and criticism. Perhaps we oversold what could be achieved ndash or at least the time it would take to make a dference. The reality was that neither the Parliament nor the Government took over full legislative and executive powers until st July ndash almost two months after the election.During that time, we scored own goals like minting medals, but some housekeeping was essential. Without fixing allowances, our staff couldnrsquot be paid. But the perception was one of self-serving MSPs, no better than their Westminster counterparts. And the building project dogged us for at least five years, even although the plan and contract had been inherited from Westminster.One of the early controversies was the decision to repeal ldquosection A, which forbade teaching of homosexuality in schools. Having been in the Commons when this particularly pernicious piece of legislation was originally passed, I had no doubt that it was right to end it. But repeal had not been mentioned in either coalition partyrsquos manesto, and the announcement without preparing the ground, nor engaging in prior consultation broke our own rules about the importance of consultation in policy making.Some might argue that in other policy areas, there was too much consultation, which made politics boring but on an issue such as the right of responsible access to land, I believe that extensive discussion with interested parties brought about a well- balanced piece of legislation, which has stood the test of time.I firmly believed that Parliamentrsquos Committees had a crucial role to play, both in holding Ministers to account and in scrutinising legislation. My experience in the first years of the Parliament was that Committees were influential and effective. I had to bring in a Bill to add a religion question to the  Census, after the Equal Opportunities Committeeturned me over when I tried to defend a cabinet decision not to include such a question. My perception, and what I hear from current Parliamentarians, is that the SNPrsquos well acclaimed discipline has robbed Committees of much of their robustness in challenging the administration. Going forward, it is to be hoped that Committees will rediscover their earlier zeal for effective scrutiny.Looking back  years, I recall an election campaign where we discussed issues of everyday importance to Scotlandrsquos people over a wide range of important domestic areas, where the new Parliament had powers. It was a refreshing change from the many general elections Irsquod fought, where the constitutional question dominated, evenit wasnrsquot ranked high in polls identying votersrsquo concerns. Regrettably, more recent election campaigns have reverted to debates about our constitutional future ndash and Irsquom not holding my breath that  will be any dferent.This is regrettable. By comparison with many devolved Parliaments and even states in federal countries, the powers of the Scottish Parliament are extensive, having been considerably added to since .

of the EC in ,  years before the crash.Mr Price, who appeared at day  of the fatal accident inquiry in Hampden said that, despite his written concerns to Eurocopter in  it was not until , after the crash, that a \"final solution\"air service bulletin was issued.Ralf Nicolai, a -year-old sales promotion manager of Airbus, who Mr Price approached about the issue said during an earlier inquiry hearing that an investigation later found water contamination could also lead to fuel sensors giving an \"over-reading\" indicating the aircraft had more fuel than it did.The inquiry is trying to find answers as to why Police Scotland helicopter G-SPAO crashed through the roof of the Clutha.In October  a report from the Air Accident Investigations Branch revealed pilot error.It found fuel transfer pumps were turned off and a controlled landing was not achieved for \"unknown reasons\".The inquiry had previously heard a police inspector who worked with the crew on board the doomed Clutha helicopter told about a history of problems with the aircrafts fuel indictators.Inspector Nicholas Whyte also speculated that the accident may have happened as the fuel warning lights did not come on in the cockpit saying that police air observers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins would never ignore red warning lights.Mr Price, , who is now the head of maintenance and engineering with the Babcock Aviation Group, said: \"In , one of our primary consideratons of risk was the water getting directly into the engine fuel system.\"He said an investigation found it was the result of a modication

as the engine accelerates past %, some water passes into the engine fuel system .Mr Price said they discovered that when an HMU drain seal drain line was disconnected the issues stopped.Mr Nicolai responded to his email saying: \"We are on the case now, doing our homework as usual.\" Mr Price said there had been no further contact two years later when he emailed Mr Nicolai and others saying: \"I am somewhat concerned that from my perspective what was and still is a flight safety issue has not been prioritised in the manner I feel it should have....\"The HMUs that were the subject of the original report failed last July [during a check]...this in effect was a double HMU failure, a situation that does not make myself or anybody  feel very happy, especially as the potential warning

asap.\" Mr Price, a former RAF corporal, said a final solution emerged in , not before Bond had introduced an interim solution.Mr Price admitted becoming frustrated by an email from Kelly Brookes of Eurocopter which said that a modication considered did not seem to make any dference.\"There was a feeling of great frustration on a number of occasions over ten years... and it was fair to say this

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney. This greatly benefits the economy of our islands.“I look forward to the outcome of the vote and hope that as many folk as possible take this opportunity to choose the name for a vessel that will become a familiar sight in local waters.”As well as the online poll, you can send your preferred name from the shortlist by post to Pilot Vessel Poll, Harbour Authority Building, Old Scapa Rd, Scapa, Kirkwall KW SD. If you submit a postal vote, please include your name and phone number.The poll closes on Tuesday, May . A winner will be drawn from the votes for the most popular name, invited to take part in September’s naming ceremony and offered the opportunity of a family trip at a later date aboard the new pilot launch.Brian Archibald, Harbour Master and Head of Marine Services, Engineering and Transportation, said: “We look forward to the delivery and naming ceremony for our new pilot launch.“Orkney continues to benefit from a signicant upturn in harbour related activity, making it essential that we invest in the equipment and vessels necessary to deliver a safe and efficient service.“Our pilot launches play a vital role at the heart of our harbours operations. They enable marine pilots to embark and disembark from vessels heading to and from berths and anchorages within the Orkney Harbours area. These operations take place day and night in all weathers # the pilot launches need to be highly capable vessels built to high specications of sea keeping and reliability.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I have the two best guys in the world so I’m really happy,” Meghan told the media.As her husband held their son, Meghan added: “He has the sweetest temperament, he’s really calm.”As they both laughed, Harry said: “I don’t know who he gets that from.”The royal baby made his debut behind closed doors, with a small press pool of only one reporter, one photographer, three cameramen, as well as the couple’s own private photographer and a household press officer photographer.Asked who the baby takes after, Meghan said: “We’re still trying to figure that out.”Harry said: “Everyone says that babies change so much over two weeks.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing.

Any seats not used within three days of the date of travel are made available for general sale.The changes are part of the next contract to operate the Scottish Government-supported air routes from Glasgow to Barra, Tiree and Campbeltown. The invitation to tender for the £ million Public Service Obligation contract, which will run for four years from th October , was published on th April.Mr Matheson said: #These flights play a vital role for the remote communities they serve, so we have spoken with passengers to see how we can make improvements and will keep ticket prices low given the leline nature of the services.#The people of Barra and Tiree told us they face capacity issues over the busy summer period, so the new contract will remove a number of little-used flights to create a bank of rotations that can be deployed at the discretion of these communities.#It will also formalise a scheme for the Barra service which reserves seats for passengers travelling for medical purposes, following a successful trial.#I look forward to this contract being awarded later this year and the benefits that come with it being realised by passengers.#"},{"url":null,"title":"turnouts announced in mid and east antrim","story":"Voter turnout has been announced for the seven District Electoral Areas across Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Of the , eligible electorate in the Ballymena ward, , votes were polled, resulting in a turnout of . per cent.

That means that  per cent of the most affordable homes are no longer available in West Belfast.”Cllr Corr continued: “The reality for us and for many many people in West Belfast who are looking for a home is the massive dference in rents between the Housing Executive houses and housing association houses,” he said.Cllr Corr said he has had numerous tenants seeking advice over their current housing association rents and that the monetary dference between that and a Housing Executive tenancy agreement could be between £ and £ per week.“Rents are decided by a housing association board, whose homes are part-funded by the Department for Communitiesbut who also need to repay loans taken out for house construction, while the Housing Executive is a totally dferent set up.“What you are finding is that housing associations are pricing out working families, especially people on low paid income who cannot afford their rents.“People are stuck. In extreme cases people have had to give up their tenancies and go back to live with their parents in what is now being referred to as the ‘boomerang generation’.“We need a radical overhaul, to increase massively the amount of affordable housing, and we need to have housing-led regeneration for many disadvantaged areas.“People who are working are forced into private rental as they can’t get a mortgage. If you can’t get a mortgage in West Belfast you are forced to look to Glenavy, Crumlin or Lisburn.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort. Its about hard work and dedication,\" he said of its joint ninth place.Principal of Castlederg High School Elaine McKelvey said she was \"delighted\" it was the highest-ranking non-grammar school in the league table.\"These results are testimony to the excellent provision for learning made at Castlederg High School by a highly dedicated staff, working in partnership with very supportive parents to ensure the best possible outcome for each young person,\" she said.Mrs McKelvey paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff during \"a most challenging period for educational delivery within all schools in Northern Ireland, given the shortfall in capital funding and inequitable remuneration for teaching staff\".\"Most of all though, we are tremendously proud of our pupils and their achievements, noting the breadth of opportunity for the future that such excellent exam results have created for them,\" she added.The Department of Education said the information contained in the league table relating to GCSE results \"does not provide a valid basis for comparing performance between schools, since it takes no account of intakes of the schools or of any other factors that may affect pupil performance\".It added: \"No single measurement can constitute a fair or accurate evaluation of a school, and the figures should be considered in the context of other information about schools and their pupils.\""},{"url":null,"title":"garda ombudsman not involved in future of policing plan committee hears","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

ombudsman is not involved in implementing a government plan on the future of policing, a committee has heard..pushThe Garda Siochana Ombudsman Commission , which investigates complaints made about the police, told the Oireachtas Justice Committee on Wednesday that the bulk of those involved in the plan are civil servants.Justice Mary Ellen Ring, chairperson of GSOC, said that her organisation had just one meeting with implementation personnel of the four-year plan Policing Service For The Future which is to be enacted by January  .“It’s clear, as one looks at the membership, there is signicant membership from Secretary Generals from throughout the public service, similarly, deputy secretary generals, a signicant number of cross-departmental representatives, also not surprisingly, the Garda Commissioner,” she said.“As the legislation is also going to deal with new structures in terms of oversight, I can’t help you as to why it wasn’t thought there wasn’t representation from current oversight bodies.“We had one meeting with implementation personnel, they continue their work at their rate, they have an ambitious timetable under the Department of an Taoiseach and it would appear they are anxious to make change.”Independent TD Clare Daly replied: “I have to say, hand on heart, on what you’ve said, I’m very worried about where this is going.“You were here three years ago, legislation was drafted, and could be in place now, but now we’re in a situation where you haven’t seen any paperwork at all, you’ve no idea what aspects are included in it, and you can put on the public record that the body looking at the implementation, is heavy on civil service, heavy on Gardai, and has zero involvement from oversight bodies, and that is actually scary and unhelpful.“It’s an appalling spectre but not surprising.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Garda badge logo A complete overhaul of the Irish police service was recommended after being dogged by years of controversy, including a whistleblower scandal which resulted in a major tribunal which highlighted dramatic shortcomings in protection for those who make complaints about the force.The Charleton Report found that whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe was “repulsively denigrated for being no more than a good citizen and police officer”.The number of whistleblower complaints requiring investigation by the ombudsman doubled last year from  to , the organisation has repeatedly raised concerns about a lack of resources to investigate the complaints properly.GSOC also told committee members that comprehensive oversight of the force is not possible because the Gardai continues to conduct investigations into complaints without informing the watchdog.If GSOC and Gardai are both investigating the same complaint, the committee heard that the two organisations will not communicate or share information, and GSOC cannot publish their reportthe Gardai has not completed their investigation, which can stall any outcome for the complainant.It was noted that making complaints can be an incredibly stressful and dficult, and officers are often on sick leave with their work or personal le suffering in the interim.Justice Ring added her organisation at times only became aware of incidents involving officers after they “picked up the paper or heard it on Morning Ireland”, and were told by Gardai after inquiring, that they were being investigated internally and it “didn’t occur” to officers they had to inform GSOC.She added that the system of investigating protected disclosures was “working well enough” however they have dficulty in any case knowing whether they have been supplied with all relevant information.“We can get what we ask for, but we don’t always get what is relevant, we have to accept we’ve gotten everything,” she added.“We don’t know sometimes whether we have everything and we have no sanction in that regard, it’s an ongoing issue, and it may be that it’s something that will always exist, short of us going into every press ourselves.”"},{"url":null,"title":"government accused after national broadband plan approved","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

A contract hasn’t even been signed yet and the Government is simply announcing a preferred bidder in a situation where there only is one bidder.“Fine Gael’s plan not only flies in the face of official advice that it is poor value for money, but it simply doesn’t make sense,” he added.People Before Profit TD Brid Smith said the decision was motivated more by election concerns and not with delivering broadband to rural communities.She described the tendering process as a “historic fiasco” that would make the National Children’s Hospital “look like a bargain”.“It is beyond belief that even after spending  billion euro on this, the State will not own the finished infrastructure after  years,” she said.She called on Government to take full ownership control of whole project.“This farce needs to stop and the state needs to take control and ownership of providing broadband by using existing semi-state companies like the ESB to provide it,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"royal couple only have eyes for their bundle of joy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities. He said delivering the proposed by-pass must also be a council priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Doubles all round for Wexford men  ","story":"IT was cold and windy at Taylorstown, near Poyntzpass, on Saturday for the annual Newry Point-to-Point races.It proved to a good meeting for Wexford with Barry OrsquoNeil, Jamie Codd and Colin Bowe all recording doubles and also for the Doyle brothers, Donnchadh and Sean.OrsquoNeilrsquos brace saw him record his rd winner of the season, while Codd was chalking up his th success in the All-Ireland ridersrsquo table.Coddrsquos double puts him on the  winner mark in the Northern Ireland Ridersrsquo Regional title race, three ahead of Noel McParlan and Rob James.OrsquoNeil and Bowe got off the mark for the day in the Derrylecka Bedding Centre maiden race for five year-old geldings, the second race of the day.Here, the partnership scored with Cremant, winning in good style from Codd on McGarry, owned by Christine McKnight and trained by her husband, Neil, at Loughbrickland. Third was Snowpiercer, ridden by James OrsquoRourke in place of Rob James.The duo then went on to win the third race, the Seven Stars maiden race for five year-old and upwards mares, with Alice OrsquoByrne coming home seven s clear of Codd on Raddle and Hum. The consistent Moylass and Ben Crawford took third place.Coddrsquos first victory came in the Boydrsquos Stores open race that saw seven go to post.A piece of history was made when his mount Kruzhlinin, owned by Camilla Sharples, who is travelling head girl to Gordon Elliott, became the first horse to win nine races in a season.OrsquoNeil set out to make all on recent Loughbrickland winner Sambremont, but had to be content with a fourth-placed finish. Codd sent his mount clear after the last to beat former champion point-to-pointer Anseanachai Cliste, ridden for the first time by Noel McParlan. John Woodsrsquo Bridgetrsquos Pet, ridden by Harley Dunne, was third.Codd then made all on Amalfi Doug in the Lynda Hughes memorial maiden race for six year-old and upwards geldings. Second past the judge was Bronco Bill, well ridden by Michael Molloy with Pyrios and Barry OrsquoNeil third.The winner is trained in Meath by Jim Dreaper, who was represented at the meeting by his son Tom, who said post-race: ldquoJob done.The best finish of the day came in the Philip McCabe Quantity Surveyor one-winner race with three horses flashing past the post, locked together.Victory went to Getaman, ridden by Derek OrsquoConnor, who has had little success on the local circuit this season.

What did happen, though, was the stuff of dreams.He took a whopping six minutes off his PB and his pacing was textbook, averaging . seconds per mile. Even better, he soaked up the atmosphere and came away saying that it had surpassed his expectations.His club mates, who had tracked him throughout, were as pleased as he was and he was quick to note that the support of fellow members had been a real boost.Having reached halfway in .., Gordy was in no mood to let a possible PB slip through his fingers and though he failed to nail a negative split, it was only by a matter of a few seconds, and perfectly forgivable.His time of .. is something special and deserves the utmost respect. Congratulations, Gordy. And I for one would not begrudge you that beer before you go home as you suggested after the race.Marguerite Robinson was the lucky recipient of the EDAC club ballot back in December and as soon as she heard, she embarked on a schedule to ensure that she made the most of the place.She certainly could not be faulted in her preparation nor in her execution.

Nevertheless, she was as happy as he afterwards. Well done to both of you.Itrsquos not by any means as simple for the enthusiastic spectator.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy.

He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record. I just needed to get into the right room with the right writers making the right music.White Feather album will be released on April  before a tour kicks off in the UK on May  for a run of seven support shows followed by six Irish headline dates.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

They are Roy Walker, former player with Luton Town, Ards, Glenavon, Portadown and Crusaders and former manager of Crusaders, Glenavon and Ballymena United and Stuart Elliott, capped  times for Northern Ireland and former player with Glentoran, Motherwell, Hull City, Doncaster Rovers, Hamilton Academical and Stirling Albion.The service will be conducted by Rev Robert Bell, from Ballyclare Presbyterian Church, who has enjoyed supporting the club throughout his years in the town, and been available to give them any encouragement and support he could. The congregation will be seated in the main stand at Dixon Park, while the service will be conducted from a dais on the pitch.The club extends a warm invitation to the whole community to join them for this very special event.Daniel O’Donnell sings the praises of Learning Disability Pride Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LARN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LARN | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

Failing that, campaigners say they “want the UK Government to intervene to end discrimination against same-sex couples in Northern Ireland.”Among the speakers who will address a rally in front of Belfast City Hall will be Sara Canning, partner of journalist Lyra McKee, who was murdered in Londonderry last month.Sara Canning said: “Marriage equality is a cause to which Lyra and I were very committed.“Lyra and I were supposed to be on a big trip to New York this week. We were going to get engaged.“We talked about getting married in Donegal, but really we wanted our love and our marriage to be recognised in Northern Ireland, just the same as the rest of our family members and friends.“But to date, politicians have stopped that happening here, despite the fact that most people support equal marriage.“If the politicians won’t legislate for equal marriage at Stormont, then the Prime Minister should do it at Westminster. That’s what I told Theresa May at Lyra’s funeral.“I wanted her to know that Lyra and I had a right to be treated as equal citizens in our own country. Surely that’s not too much to ask “Myself and lots of Lyra’s friends and family are going to be marching for marriage equality. We hope people will join us.”Organisers say they expect thousands to join the march for marriage equality, which will gather in the Belfast’s Writers’ Square at pm.Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland director of Amnesty International and a member of the Love Equality campaign for equal marriage, said:DUP gay candidate row: Dr Paisley must be turning in his grave, says councillorSocial media reaction to gay D.U.P. candidate letter Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It is time for political leaders in Belfast and London to respect the will of the people of Northern Ireland, which is overwhelmingly in support of marriage equality.“This march will be a demonstration of that support, a demand which must be heard in the corridors of Stormont and Westminster.“Marriage equality in Northern Ireland is a litmus test for whether or not any future devolved government is committed to treating all citizens equally.“If Stormont is incapable of delivering equality for people here, then it is the responsibility of the Westminster to end discrimination against the LGBT community.”try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

The memo is an attempt to reinforce that understanding.It is expected to be signed by UK Cabinet minister David Lidington and Irish deputy premier Simon Coveney, with Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley in attendance.The intergovernmental conference is provided for by the  Good Friday Agreement and facilitates bilateral co-operation between Britain and Ireland.It was resurrected after seldom being used because of the absence of a breakthrough at Stormont.The fresh powersharing talks process began in Belfast on Tuesday.Leaders of the five main parties acknowledged mounting public impatience and anger at a stalemate that has left the region without a ing devolved government for over two years.DUP gay candidate row: Dr Paisley must be turning in his grave, says councillor Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"They held a short round-table meeting at Stormont House on Tuesday afternoon for the first exchanges of a new process initiated by the UK and Irish governments.The process will involve agenda-setting and stock-taking meetings between the five leaders and two governments at least once a week, with five working groups to focus on the detail of key disputes at the heart of the deadlock.The last DUP Sinn Fein-led powersharing coalition imploded in January  when the late Martin McGuinness quit as Sinn Fein deputy first minister amid a row about a botched green energy scheme.The fallout over the Renewable Heat Incentivewas soon overtaken by disputes over the Irish language, the region’s ban on same-sex marriage and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.Six previous initiatives to restore devolution failed to find consensus.try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

historic Palace of Westminster in the south, backed by new legislation being introduced on Wednesday.MPs are expected to be ldquodecanted to Richmond House, the former Whitehall home of the Department of Health, and the Lords to the nearby Queen Elizabeth II Centre in the mid-s, with the whole project scheduled for completion early in the following decade. -- vw, px\"Image showing the planned

the leaky roof that temporarily closed the chamber last month.He said:ldquoA few weeks ago we saw water pouring through the ceiling of the chamber and the sitting had to be suspended.ldquoThe risk of

stuck with their original proposal to consolidate the Lurgan and Portadown campuses of the school on the Portadown site.However, that consultation is already the subject of a judicial review.News of the decision was revealed by local MLA Doug Beattie, who said: “I am extremely disappointed that the Education Authorityhave decided that Craigavon Senior High School will operate on a single site, in Portadown, with effect from  September, , or as soon as possible thereafter following a public consultation.“Having received a public response to the EA Consultation with a ratio of over : against the EA proposal they have decided to go ahead with their plan to bus Lurgan children to Portadown.“This is absolute proof that the consultation was a sham, was biased it its methodology and that the outcome was pre-determined. “I am saddened that the wishes of those whose children will be affected the most have been discarded without a thought and that the support they should have received from public representatives simply did not materialise.“This consultation process is now subject to a Judicial Review following a complaint from one of the pupils affected and has been granted legal aid.”He added: “I am confident it will show that the process was flawed and that a true Lurgan solution was never truly considered.“In the meantime I will continue to speak up for the community who will now be left wondering why they are being treated in such an uncaring manner and why their voices are being ignored.”The EA launched an eight week consultation exercise on the future of the Lurgan campus of the school in January which brought a heated debate across Lurgan.Opinions were ided among those who supported the EA plan to consolidate the two campuses of the school in Portadown and those who wanted to see a ‘Lurgan solution, specically an - school at the Lurgan Junior High School site.The consultation closed in March.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .
